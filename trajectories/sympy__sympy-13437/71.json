The expected result is infinity (`oo`), but the current output is `bell(oo)`. This suggests that the `limit` function's handling of the `bell` function needs to be investigated and possibly fixed. The search results show the `limit` function definition and related heuristics in the `sympy/series/limits.py` file. By analyzing these code spans, we can identify if they are relevant to fixing the issue. The `limit` function and its heuristics appear to be handling various mathematical functions and properties, such as `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, and specific functions like `fibonacci`. Since the `bell` function is related to combinatorial numbers like the Bell numbers, which represent the number of partitions of a set, understanding how these other functions are handled might provide clues on how to fix the `bell` function's `limit` evaluation. Therefore, the code spans identified here, especially those related to `limit` and its applied heuristics, should be considered relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` which currently returns `bell(oo)` instead of the expected infinity. The issue is to be resolved by ensuring that the Bell numbers, which represent the number of partitions of a set, can be evaluated at infinity. This aligns with recent fixes for similar behavior in Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.\n\nFrom the provided file context, it's evident that the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is central to this issue. The `heuristics` function within this file handles various cases for determining limits, including cases where the limit is towards infinity. It attempts to decompose the expression into simpler parts and evaluate their limits individually. If any part of the expression is indeterminate or results in a `Limit` object, it fails to proceed.\n\nThe new search results augment our understanding with specific details on the Bell numbers implementation. The `bell` function in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` is the primary function under scrutiny. It includes methods to compute Bell numbers (`_bell`), Bell polynomials (`_bell_poly`), and incomplete Bell polynomials (`_bell_incomplete_poly`). The evaluation of Bell numbers based on integer inputs is covered in the `eval` method.\n\nThe challenge here is to integrate the correct handling of Bell numbers at infinity into the existing `limit` function without disrupting other functionalities. The `heuristics` function within `limits.py`, or perhaps a similar approach used for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, could provide a blueprint for implementing the necessary changes. Also, the `gruntz` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` deals with limits towards infinity and might offer insights or a direct method for handling this case specifically.\n\nTo sum up, the relevant code spans across at least three files: `limits.py` for the general limit handling, `gruntz.py` for advanced limit computations, and `numbers.py` for the Bell number specifics. There's potential to improve the limit computation within the `heuristics` function in `limits.py` or to implement a new case in `gruntz.py` if the current tools are insufficient.",

Searching through the provided file context, there isn't a direct check or evaluation of `bell(oo)` within the `bell` class or the `limit` function. The `limit` function uses the `gruntz` method and heuristics but doesn't specifically handle the `bell` function limit in a custom way. Therefore, no specific code span directly addresses the issue or evaluates `bell(oo)` to infinity.",
            "search_suggestions": "Look for where the `bell` function or its limits are handled in the `limit` function and check if any custom handling for combinatorial functions like `bell` exists. If not, expand the search to include where the `limit` function integrates with such functions to see if modifying the heuristic handling of the `bell` function could address the issue."
