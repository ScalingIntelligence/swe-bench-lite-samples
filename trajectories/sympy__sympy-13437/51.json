To address this, one would need to look into the implementation of the `bell` function and its associated methods, particularly those involved in handling limits or asymptotic behavior. The search results provide several critical sections that might be relevant:\n\n1. **Definition and static methods** in the `bell` class, which include methods for calculating Bell numbers (`_bell`) and Bell polynomials (`_bell_poly`).\n2. The **evaluation method (`eval`)** which determines how the function behaves for specific integer inputs.\n3. The **rewrite as Sum method (`_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`)** which might indicate how the function can be expressed using summations and could potentially be used to handle the limit.\n\nGiven the specific issue, focusing on sections that deal with the mathematical definition and evaluation of the `bell` function at extreme values (like infinity) would be crucial.

The `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` seems to be responsible for computing limits, particularly through the `doit` method which handles the heuristics and a deeper computation strategy through `gruntz`. For the Bell numbers, the relevant code spans are found within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, encapsulating the `bell` class and its methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, and `eval` which define the behavior of Bell numbers for specific inputs and functionalities. Relevant spans within `limits.py` also reveal the handling of limits for various arithmetic operations in Sympy when applying heuristics and trying to evaluate limits which might include the Bell number's limit as a part of such operations.",

  "initial_message": "bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)\n`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
