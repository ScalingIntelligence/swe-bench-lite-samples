I reviewed the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` for the `bell` function and its methods. The `bell.eval` method is particularly important as it evaluates the Bell number for given `n`. However, the limit computation specific to `bell(n)` at infinity is not explicitly handled within the `bell` class methods. Therefore, I searched for the limit computation logic in `sympy/series/limits.py`. The `limit` function and `Limit` class in this file are crucial for defining and computing limits in SymPy. The `heuristics` function tries to handle specific cases, including when the limit is at infinity. Since the Bell numbers are not directly handled in the limit computation heuristics, the next step would be to add a specific check for Bell numbers in this function or in the `bell` class itself to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` correctly evaluates to infinity.",

From the provided context, the relevant spans include the `bell` class definition and the `bell.eval` method where the evaluation of the `bell` function is handled. Additionally, the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` should be considered as it is responsible for calculating limits. In the search results section, we can also find relevant code spans such as `bell._bell`, `bell._bell_poly`, `bell._bell_incomplete_poly`, and `bell.eval` which are related to the `bell` function.
