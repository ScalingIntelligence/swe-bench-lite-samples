The issue suggests that the behavior is akin to that of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, implying that the limit evaluation might need adjustment for combinatorial functions. Given the search results, the relevant sections seem to be within `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`.\n\nIn `numbers.py`, the `bell.eval` span is particularly relevant, as it directly deals with the evaluation of the `bell` function where the issue might lie. Additionally, the `limit` and `Limit.doit` spans in `limits.py` are essential since they are responsible for computing the limits of expressions. These sections are likely the starting points for investigating and possibly fixing the reported issue. Further, the presence of symbolic handling and combinatorial functions in `limit` hints at where the adjustment for `bell` might fit.\n\nConsidering the extent of understanding needed, along with the provided contextual code, identifying the exact spans that need adjustment or further examination in `bell.eval` in `numbers.py` and the `limit` function in `limits.py` is crucial. This preliminary step narrows down the scope for anyone looking to fix the bug, aligning with the issue's requirement for improving the limit handling for `bell(n)` as infinity when `n` approaches infinity.",

  "initial_message": "bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)\n`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
