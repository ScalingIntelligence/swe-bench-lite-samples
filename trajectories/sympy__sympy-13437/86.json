            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue regarding the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`, it's important to first understand the implementation of the `bell` function and its relationship with the `limit` function. The `bell` function is found within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, specifically in the `bell` class. This class contains methods to compute Bell numbers and Bell polynomials. Notably, the `eval` method of the `bell` class is responsible for evaluating Bell numbers for nonnegative integer inputs. The other relevant part of the codebase is the `sympy/series/limits.py` file, which contains the implementation of the `limit` function. This function is essential for computing limits of mathematical expressions, including those involving Bell numbers. The `limit` function uses heuristics to determine the limit of an expression, and it is here that we need to ensure that the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity is correctly handled. Given the provided code, it appears that the current implementation might not directly evaluate `bell(oo)` to `oo`, as the limit function does not handle this specific case explicitly. Therefore, identifying the relevant code spans in both files is crucial for understanding how to address the issue, specifically focusing on the `bell.eval` method and the `limit` function's approach to handling infinities and functions like `bell(n)`.",
