The `heuristics` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` seems particularly relevant for handling specific types of limits, including those related to combinatorial numbers.

The search results include relevant sections of the `limits.py` file, which deal with the `limit` function and its heuristic handling. These sections are: the `limit` function itself, the `heuristics` function, and the `doit` method of the `Limit` class. These sections are crucial for understanding how SymPy computes limits and how it might be returning `bell(oo)` instead of `oo`. Additionally, the `_MultisetHistogram` function in the `numbers.py` file is also relevant since it is used in combinatorial functions like the Bell numbers.
