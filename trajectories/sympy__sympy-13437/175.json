This is similar to recent fixes made for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. The relevant files identified from the context include functions related to combinatorial numbers, series limits, and core numbers. The focus should be on the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, and possibly the `Infinity` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.",

The search results provide a deeper look into these elements, including the static methods for calculating Bell numbers and polynomials (`_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`) within the `bell` class, and the `limit` function and its `doit` method which handles the actual evaluation of limits. Additionally, the `Infinity` class is relevant as it defines the behavior of infinity in SymPy. These code spans should help in understanding and potentially fixing the issue where the limit does not evaluate to the expected infinity.",

It uses the `gruntz` method by default, which is a robust algorithm for computing limits. However, if the `gruntz` method fails or is not applicable, it falls back to using heuristics to find the limit. The `bell` function does not have a specific handling for when `n` approaches infinity within the given code snippets. This suggests that the generic limit handling, which may involve the `gruntz` method or heuristics, is being used for `bell(n)` when `n` approaches infinity. To resolve the issue, we need to implement specific logic within the `limit` function to handle the `bell(n)` limit case when `n` approaches infinity.

The `bell` class methods currently do not handle the case when `n` approaches infinity. Additionally, the `limit` function relies on the `gruntz` method or heuristics for general limit evaluations, and these do not currently make specific accommodations for the `bell` function. To address the issue, it is necessary to add specific logic within the `limit` function for the `bell(n)` limit case when `n` approaches infinity, ensuring it returns `oo` rather than `bell(oo)`. This could involve modifying the `limit` function to detect when the expression involves `bell(n)` and directly return `oo` when `n` is evaluated as infinity.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
