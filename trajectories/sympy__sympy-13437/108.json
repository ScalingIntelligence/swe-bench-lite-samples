This issue is similar to recent fixes for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, indicating a possible need to adjust or add logic in the `limit` function specifically for the `bell` function. Since the issue states that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated, it's likely that the handling of the `bell` function in the `limit` method or the `bell` function itself may require a modification. I'll focus my search on the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file for the `bell` function to see if additional logic for handling the infinite limit case needs to be added. Additionally, I'll check `sympy/series/limits.py` for the `limit` function to see if there's a general handling of combinatorial functions, including `bell`.",

This indicates a need to investigate the `bell` function and its integration with the limit function. From the search results, the `bell` function is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and involves recurrence relations for calculating Bell numbers. The `limit` function and its associated methods are found in `sympy/series/limits.py`, which handles the computation of limits. To resolve the issue, it's necessary to check how the limit function interacts with the `bell` function and specifically ensure that when `n` approaches infinity, the function correctly evaluates to infinity rather than returning `bell(oo)`. This involves understanding the implementation of the `bell` function and how it is integrated with the limit computation logic.\n\nIn `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, the `bell` class defines methods for computing Bell numbers, including `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, and `_bell_incomplete_poly`. The `eval` method is also relevant as it determines the evaluation of Bell numbers based on the input. Additionally, the `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method might be related to the integration with limit functions.\n\nIn `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function and the `Limit` class encapsulate the logic for computing limits. The `doit` method of the `Limit` class is crucial as it performs the limit computation, including handling cases where the limit involves infinity. The heuristics part of the code also processes various types of expressions to simplify or compute their limits.\n\nTo fix the issue, it's important to ensure that within the `doit` method of the `Limit` class, when handling `bell(n)`, the function should correctly evaluate to infinity for `n` approaching infinity. This may involve modifying how the `bell` function is detected and handled within the limit computation logic.",

In the new search results, we find the `Limit.doit` method, which handles the evaluation of limits, and the `bell.eval` method, which handles the evaluation of Bell numbers. Both of these sections are crucial because they define how the limit and Bell numbers are computed at infinity. The `bell.eval` method does not currently handle the case where `n` is `S.Infinity`, which may be the root cause of the issue. Similarly, the `Limit.doit` method iterates through the arguments and computes limits individually, which might not handle the `bell` function correctly without special handling for `S.Infinity`.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
