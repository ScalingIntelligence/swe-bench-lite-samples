Additionally, code related to handling limits within `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/series/gruntz.py` should also be examined for potential modifications. The relevant spans appear to be those defining the 'bell' function itself and its evaluation methods, which are used by the limit function to compute the limit as `n` approaches infinity. Furthermore, the heuristics and limit computation logic in `limits.py` need inspection to understand how the Bell function is currently treated and how it might be improved to produce `oo` instead of `bell(oo)`.",

This involves understanding the implementation of the Bell numbers and how they are handled in the limit function.\n\n1. **File Context Analysis**: The initial context provided includes code spans from `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`. The relevant code spans include the definition of the `bell` class and its methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, `eval`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`. Additionally, the file `sympy/series/limits.py` contains the `limit` function and its auxiliary functions like `heuristics` and `Limit.doit`, which are crucial for understanding how limits are computed.\n\n2. **New Search Results Analysis**: The new search results also include code spans from `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/series/gruntz.py`. The `sympy/series/limits.py` spans include the `limit` function, `heuristics`, and `Limit.doit`, providing more context on how limits are evaluated, especially concerning the handling of `S.Infinity` and `S.NegativeInfinity`. The `sympy/series/gruntz.py` spans include functions like `limitinf`, `mrv`, `sign`, and others related to the gruntz algorithm, which is used for evaluating limits.\n\n3. **Identifying Relevant Code Spans**: The main relevance of the new search results lies in understanding how limits are evaluated and what heuristics and algorithms are used when approaching infinity (`oo`). The implementation of the `bell` function within `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` is essential but insufficient on its own to fix the issue. The additional context from `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/series/gruntz.py` provides insights into how SymPy handles special cases and large values.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` correctly evaluates to `oo`. This might involve adjusting the `heuristics` function or the `Limit.doit` method to recognize the behavior of Bell numbers at infinity.",

Additionally, the `limit` function in `limits.py` and the subsidiary functions like `gruntz`, `limitinf`, `heuristics`, and `sign` are important for understanding how limits are currently computed in SymPy.
