The problem involves the Bell numbers and the limit function in SymPy. Relevant files and functions likely include those in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` where the `bell` class is defined, and `sympy/series/limits.py` where the `limit` function is defined. Additionally, since the Bell numbers represent set partitions, understanding the implementation in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` might be crucial.",

This suggests that the `bell` function and its handling within the limit function are crucial for addressing the issue. From the provided file context, we see that the `bell` function is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, and there's a corresponding `eval` method that handles the evaluation of `bell(n)` for certain conditions, including integer and nonnegative `n`. However, there isn't explicit handling for `n` being infinity, which is the core of the issue. In the new search results, the same file contains additional methods related to the `bell` function, such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and the `eval` method. These methods seem relevant as they deal with various aspects of the computation involving the Bell numbers. In `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function and its related structures like `heuristics` and `Limit` class are found. Although not directly modifying the `bell` function, understanding how the limit is computed in general within this module will be crucial to solving the problem. The `heuristics` function processes different types of expressions like `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, and `Function`, which could potentially interact with the `bell` function during limit computation. Therefore, while the focus is on the `bell` function and its handling in limits, understanding the broader context of how limits are computed in SymPy is also important.",
