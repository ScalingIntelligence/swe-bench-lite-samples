Given that Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems logical that as `n` approaches infinity, the Bell number should also approach infinity. The relevant files to investigate this issue seem to be those dealing with combinatorial functions (like `numbers.py` for the `bell` function) and those dealing with limits (like `limits.py` and `gruntz.py`). Specifically, we should focus on the `bell` class in `numbers.py` and the `limits` and `Limit` functions in `limits.py`.",

The search results provide multiple spans of code from `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`. The analysis focuses on identifying code spans that are relevant to the evaluation of the Bell numbers and their limits. The `bell` class in `numbers.py` contains methods for calculating Bell numbers, and the `limit` function in `limits.py` is the main function for computing limits. The specific spans of interest are those related to the `bell` class and the `limit` function, as they directly pertain to the issue of evaluating the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. By examining these spans, we can determine the necessary changes to fix the reported behavior.",

Although the `bell` class does not currently handle the limit for `n` approaching infinity, the structure and methods within the class suggest that it could be modified to handle this case. The `limit` function already processes limits for various functions, including combinatorial ones. Therefore, the relevant areas for modification to address this issue are clearly identified in the file context.

  "initial_message": "bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)\n`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
