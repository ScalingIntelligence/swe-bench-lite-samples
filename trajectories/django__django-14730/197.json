This implies that when a ManyToManyField is defined with the symmetrical argument or it's self-referential, the related_name should not be allowed and an error should be raised if it is provided. This requires modifications to the ManyToManyField class's initialization and possibly its validation methods.\n\nThe current context provided contains significant portions of the ManyToManyField class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, including the `__init__` method where the `related_name` is accepted as a parameter and the `check` method which is responsible for performing various checks on the field.\n\nThe new search results reconfirm the presence of the ManyToManyField class and its `__init__` and `check` methods. They also include the `RelatedField` class, which is a superclass for `ManyToManyField` and contains a `__init__` method that also handles `related_name`. Importantly, the `RelatedField` class has a `check` method that includes validation for the `related_name`.\n\nBased on these findings, the identified spans are the `ManyToManyField` class, its `__init__` method, and the `check` method. Additionally, the `RelatedField` class, which is the superclass of `ManyToManyField`, is also identified since it contains critical functionality related to handling and checking the `related_name` parameter. This includes the `__init__` method where the `related_name` is initially set and the `check` method where validation logic is implemented. It's crucial to ensure that the validation logic accurately captures the condition where the `related_name` should not be allowed if the `ManyToManyField` is symmetrical or self-referential.",
