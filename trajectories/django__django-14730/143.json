The reported issue specifically concerns the __init__ method where the 'related_name' parameter is accepted. We also need to look at the 'check' method and its supporting methods to understand how validation errors are generated. The ManyToManyField.__init__ span is particularly relevant because it processes the 'related_name' parameter and the 'symmetrical' parameter to determine whether the related field should be created. We should also consider the ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model method, which conducts checks on the relationship model, including the presence of the related_name field. Finally, the 'contribute_to_class' method is crucial as it contributes attributes to the class, potentially handling related names. These spans of code are key to understanding and implementing the proposed solution to raise an error when related_name is defined in a symmetrical ManyToManyField.",
