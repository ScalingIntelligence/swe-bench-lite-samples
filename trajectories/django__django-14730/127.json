The goal is to ensure that an error is raised if a developer attempts to define a `related_name` in such a condition. The search results include relevant spans from `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. Here's the analysis of the code spans in the search results:\n\n1. **File: django/db/models/fields/related.py**\n   - Span `RelatedField._check_related_name_is_valid`: This method checks if the `related_name` is valid. It does not explicitly check for the condition where `related_name` is defined with `symmetrical=True`.\n   - Span `ManyToManyField.__init__`: This initializer sets the `symmetrical` attribute based on whether the `ManyToManyField` is self-referential. This is relevant as it sets the stage for the logic we need to enhance.\n   - Span `ManyToManyField.check`: It seems incomplete, but it would be the location to add checks related to `ManyToManyField` including the one we are interested in adding.\n\n2. **File: django/db/models/base.py**\n   - **Span `Model._check_fields`**: This is responsible for checking individual fields on the model. Although it does not directly address the symmetrical issue, it is a relevant place for gathering information about fields.\n\nGiven this analysis, the focus should be on enhancing the `ManyToManyField.check` method to include a specific check for the condition where `related_name` is defined while `symmetrical` is True. The code in `ManyToManyField.__init__` will help ensure that the check is made at the right time, after `symmetrical` has been properly set.\n\nIn summary, the identified spans provide context and components needed to implement the check. The next step is to ensure that within `ManyToManyField.check`, a condition is added to raise an error if `related_name` is not None and `symmetrical` is True.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
