The solution proposed is to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n\nIn the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are related to the ManyToManyField class and its initialization (__init__) and check methods. These methods handle the setup and validation of ManyToMany fields, including the symmetrical attribute and related_name. Specifically, the ManyToManyField.__init__ span handles the initialization of the ManyToManyField, including the setting of the symmetrical attribute. The ManyToManyField.check span includes the validation checks for the ManyToManyField, which can be extended to include a check for the related_name attribute when symmetrical is True.\n\nBy identifying these spans, we can pinpoint where the logic for handling the symmetrical attribute and related_name resides, and where an additional validation check can be implemented to raise an error if a related_name is defined in such conditions.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
