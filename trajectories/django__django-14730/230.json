From the search results, the relevant spans are identified in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file within the 'ManyToManyField' class definition and its 'init' method. Additionally, the 'rel_class' attribute in the 'ManyToManyField' class points to 'ManyToManyRel', which is defined in 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py'.

This class includes methods `__init__`, `check`, and `contribute_to_class`, which are relevant to the issue of preventing the definition of `related_name` on symmetrical ManyToMany fields. In `__init__`, there's a check to set `symmetrical` to `True` if the field is self-referential, which aligns with the issue's requirement. The `check` method could potentially be used to add validation for this case, although it currently only checks for uniqueness constraints that are not relevant to this issue. The `contribute_to_class` method has logic for handling symmetrical relationships, notably setting the `related_name` to a specific format when the relationship is symmetrical and the model is self-referential. However, there isn't explicit error raising or validation code within these methods that would prevent the definition of `related_name` when it's a symmetrical relationship.

Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
