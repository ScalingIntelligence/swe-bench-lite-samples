This requires identifying where the ManyToManyField is instantiated and where its attributes are processed. The search results contain a span with the import statements, several class definitions for different types of fields, and a detailed __init__ method for the ManyToManyField. The __init__ method is particularly relevant as it processes parameters like 'symmetrical' and 'related_name'. It initializes these parameters and checks their validity. Here, we can see that if 'symmetrical' is set to True, it might be an opportunity to add a validation check to raise an error if 'related_name' is also provided, ensuring that the developer cannot define a related_name in such conditions.\n\nOne important part needed to resolve the issue is to assess the current validity check mechanisms for 'related_name' in the context of 'ManyToManyField' and also considering the 'symmetrical' parameter. The 'check' method currently checks multiple aspects related to ManyToManyField but does not specifically address the combination of 'symmetrical' and 'related_name'. This understanding will help in designing an appropriate check to raise an error explicitly when a developer tries to define 'related_name' on a symmetrical ManyToManyField.\n\nThere is a need to include code that checks the symmetrical and related_name parameters together to ensure both are in accord with the desired behavior as per the issue, without which defining a related_name in this condition could cause confusion.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
