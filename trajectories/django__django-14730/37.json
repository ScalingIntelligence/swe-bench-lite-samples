The current context and search results provide sections of code related to ManyToManyField initialization, contribute_to_class method, and the handling of symmetrical relationships. While the search results do not directly address the exact issue of raising an error for the combination of symmetrical and related_name, they provide the necessary context to understand how to implement such a check. The identified code spans include portions where symmetrical relationships and related_names are handled. Based on these findings, the next step would be to implement a validation check within the ManyToManyField initialization or contribute_to_class method to raise an error if both symmetrical and related_name are specified.",
