The ManyToManyField class includes an '__init__' method where the 'related_name' parameter is accepted. This method also handles the 'symmetrical' parameter. The key action here is to introduce a check during the initialization of a ManyToManyField that raises an error if both 'related_name' is provided and 'symmetrical' is True or if it's a self-referential relationship (where 'to' equals 'RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT'). Looking at the provided code spans, the '__init__' method of ManyToManyField is the most relevant section as it involves the parameters directly related to the issue. Other sections of the code, such as the 'check' method, could potentially be used to validate the field settings after initialization, but it's less directly related to preventing the error at the point of field definition.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
