The goal is to raise an error to avoid confusion. To address this, we need to focus on the 'ManyToManyField' class and its methods where 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' are handled. The 'ManyToManyField.__init__' method and the '_check_relationship_model' method within the 'check' method are crucial, as they involve the initialization and validation of these parameters. The existing code context already includes these methods, and the new search results confirm their presence, but lack the specific validation or error-raising logic required by the issue. Therefore, we need to extract these methods to understand how they handle 'symmetrical' and 'related_name', but they don't yet include the specific enhancement needed, which would be to raise an error if 'related_name' is defined when 'symmetrical' is True.",
