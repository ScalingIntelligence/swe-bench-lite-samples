This involves identifying where the ManyToManyField is defined and where the checks for symmetrical relationships and related_name are handled. The search results are promising because they contain the definition of ManyToManyField and its constructor method (__init__). Within the constructor, the symmetrical attribute is handled, and it's a good place to potentially add an error check if related_name is provided when symmetrical is True or when the field is self-referential. The _check_relationship_model method also checks the relationship model, which might be relevant for validation later, but it doesn't currently contain the logic to enforce the error mentioned in the issue.

This is to prevent confusion since the related field on the target model is not created in such cases.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, we can focus on the ManyToManyField class and its __init__ method to see how the symmetrical parameter is handled. Additionally, we should examine the check method and its sub-methods to determine if there's any validation currently in place for the related_name when symmetrical is True. However, based on the provided context, there doesn't appear to be any explicit check for the combination of symmetrical=True and defined related_name. Therefore, we need to identify the correct point to insert such validation to raise an appropriate error.\n\nThe relevant parts of the code include the ManyToManyField.__init__ span, where the constructor is defined, and the ManyToManyField.check span, which contains the overall validation framework for the ManyToManyField.
