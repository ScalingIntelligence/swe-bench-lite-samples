This may lead to confusion due to the related field not being created as expected. To prevent this, we need to identify areas in the Django codebase where a ManyToManyField is defined with the symmetrical argument and where a related_name is also specified. This will likely reside within the ManyToManyField class or related fields/descriptors. We should focus on methods like check, contribute_to_class, and contribute_to_related_class within the ManyToManyField class. Additionally, looking at related classes such as ForeignObject, ForeignKey, and related descriptors could also be beneficial. The goal is to find the logical block or function that can intercept and raise an error when an invalid combination of symmetrical and related_name is detected.",

The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that address the creation and management of ManyToManyFields, especially concerning the 'symmetrical' argument and the 'related_name' attribute. After examining the code, it's clear that the ManyToManyField class and its methods are central to the implementation of many-to-many relationships in Django, including handling the 'symmetrical' parameter and 'related_name'. The '__init__' method of ManyToManyField handles the initialization of these attributes and provides the context for where the check for 'related_name' should occur when 'symmetrical' is true or the relationship is self-referential. The 'contribute_to_class' method also plays a critical role in how these fields are added to a class, and it makes sense to include a check there to ensure no 'related_name' is defined under these conditions. These findings are sufficient to address the reported issue without needing additional code spans from the search results.",
