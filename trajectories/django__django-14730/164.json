This issue is relevant to the ManyToManyField class and its related operations, especially when dealing with symmetrical relationships. The search results provided include several spans of code from the Django source, particularly in the file `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. These spans contain the implementation of the ManyToManyField class, including its initialization (__init__) and contribution to class methods (contribute_to_class). These methods handle the logic for setting related_name and managing symmetrical relationships. By analyzing these spans, it's clear that they are directly related to the reported issue. The code checks for the symmetry of the relationship and handles related_name accordingly. Specifically, the span `ManyToManyField.__init__` includes the logic that sets the symmetrical attribute and checks for the through model and related_name. The span `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class` further elaborates on how related_name is managed in the context of symmetrical relationships. Based on this analysis, the relevant spans of code that need attention to address the reported issue are those related to the ManyToManyField class and its handling of symmetrical relationships and related_name.",
