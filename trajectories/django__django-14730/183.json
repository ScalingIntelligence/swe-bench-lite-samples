The proposal is to raise an error in such cases to prevent this confusion.\n\nFrom the existing context in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, we can see that the `ManyToManyField` class and its `__init__` method handle the initialization of the field, including the setting of `related_name`. There is also a check method for `RelatedField` that includes checks for the validity of `related_name` and `related_query_name`.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context in the form of `RelatedField._check_related_name_is_valid`, which checks if the `related_name` is a valid identifier or ends with a '+' and raises an error if not. This function could potentially be extended to include the check for symmetrical ManyToManyFields.\n\nBased on the issue and the existing code, it seems appropriate to extend the `_check_related_name_is_valid` method to include a check for symmetrical ManyToManyFields and raise an error if `related_name` is defined in such cases.",

The analysis of the reported issue indicates the need to raise an error when a developer defines a `ManyToManyField` with the `symmetrical` argument or in a self-referential relationship, and also specifies a `related_name`. This task requires focusing on the `__init__`, `contribute_to_class`, and `check` methods of the `ManyToManyField` class, as these methods handle the initialization, class contribution, and validation checks for the field respectively. The `__init__` method initializes the field, where the `symmetrical` argument is set. The `contribute_to_class` method is where the `related_name` is processed. The `check` method, including its submethods such as `_check_related_name_is_valid`, needs to be extended to validate and potentially raise an error if both `symmetrical` is True (or self-referential) and `related_name` is defined. The identified code spans provide a good starting point, as they cover necessary methods to implement the required changes.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
