This can lead to confusion for developers who may not understand why the related field is not being created on the target model. To address this, the solution involves raising an error when a ManyToManyField is defined under these conditions. The search should focus on the 'ManyToManyField' class in the 'related.py' module, particularly the 'contribute_to_class' and 'check' methods, as these are likely places where the validation and error handling would occur.",

This is important because such fields do not create a related field on the target model, which can lead to confusion. The task is to identify relevant code spans in the search results where handling of symmetrical 'ManyToManyFields' and 'related_name' is managed. From the search results, it's evident that the 'ManyToManyField' class definition is crucial, including its '__init__' and 'contribute_to_class' methods. The '__init__' method initializes the field and checks the 'symmetrical' parameter, while the 'contribute_to_class' method contributes the field to the model class, where the related_name is managed. These are the key parts where the logic for symmetrical relationships and related_name handling resides. There isn't a direct explicit error raising for the invalid 'related_name' with symmetrical 'ManyToManyFields', suggesting this new functionality needs to be implemented based on the identified code sections.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
