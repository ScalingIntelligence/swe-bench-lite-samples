The issue primarily addresses the confusion when developers unintentionally define related_name in symmetrical ManyToMany relationships. The relevant code spans are mostly from the files 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py'. Specifically, the 'ManyToManyField' class definition, the '__init__' method of 'ManyToManyField', the 'check' method of 'ManyToManyField', and the 'contribute_to_class' method of 'ManyToManyField' directly deal with the initialization and handling of ManyToMany relationships. Additionally, the 'ManyToManyRel' class in 'reverse_related.py' is relevant as it defines the remote relationship for ManyToManyFields. These code spans can aid in implementing the error-raising functionality when a related_name is defined in problematic ManyToManyField initializations.",

Specifically, the ManyToManyField class definition includes parameters like 'symmetrical' and 'related_name', which are central to the issue. The class initialization checks for conflicts between 'symmetrical' and 'related_name', and there's handling for setting 'related_name' based on the 'symmetrical' property. This aligns with the requirement to prevent defining 'related_name' in symmetrical ManyToManyFields. Moreover, the 'check' method in ManyToManyField suggests a place where custom validation could be added to raise an error if 'related_name' is defined under the wrong conditions. The related 'reverse_related.py' file also contributes context by showing the ManyToManyRel class which is used in ManyToManyField, reinforcing understanding of the relationship setup. Given this comprehensive context, it's evident that all necessary elements to address the issue concerning 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' in ManyToMany relationships are present.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
