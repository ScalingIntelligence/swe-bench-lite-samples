This is particularly relevant in Django's model definitions, where ManyToManyFields can be symmetrical, meaning that if an object A is related to an object B, B is automatically related to A. In such cases, defining a related_name can lead to confusion or errors because Django does not create the related field on the target model. The task is to identify code sections in the Django codebase that deal with ManyToManyFields, especially those related to initialization and validation, to determine where an error might be raised if a related_name is specified when symmetrical is True or when the relationship is self-referential. The search results include various sections from 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', notably the 'ManyToManyField' class and its '__init__' and 'check' methods. These sections are directly relevant as they handle the initialization and validation of ManyToManyFields, including the parameters like symmetrical, related_name, and through. The 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span is particularly relevant as it initializes these parameters and sets the symmetrical attribute based on whether the relationship is recursive. The 'ManyToManyField.check' and its related '_check_unique' and '_check_ignored_options' methods are also relevant for validating the field definition. Overall, these sections provide the necessary context to understand where and how to implement the proposed change to raise an error when related_name is used inappropriately with symmetrical ManyToManyFields.",

To prevent developers from defining a `related_name` on a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`, we need to find or add a validation method that explicitly checks for this condition. The current `_check_ignored_options` method is not appropriate for this purpose as it deals with warnings rather than errors. Therefore, I suggest looking deeper into the `_check_relationship_model` or adding a new method to specifically handle this validation.",
