The provided search results include definitions and functionalities related to `ManyToManyField`, `ForeignObject`, and their various attributes and behaviors. Notably, the span 'ManyToManyField.__init__' includes logic for initializing a `ManyToManyField` and handling the `related_name` parameter. This is particularly relevant because it is here where the check for symmetry and the use of `related_name` could potentially be implemented to raise an error if conditions are not met. Therefore, focusing on this span and possibly expanding checks in the `ManyToManyField.check` method would be crucial to addressing the issue accurately.",
