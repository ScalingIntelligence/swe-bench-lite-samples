This involves understanding the behavior of `ManyToManyField` when the `symmetrical` argument is passed or in self-referential relationships. The search results provide vital insights into the `ManyToManyField` class, specifically focusing on its `__init__` and `contribute_to_class` methods. These methods handle the logic for initializing the field and contributing it to a class, respectively. Notably, the `__init__` method sets the `symmetrical` attribute and checks for the `related_name`. The `contribute_to_class` method further manipulates the `related_name` based on the symmetry of the relationship. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially implementing the proposed feature to raise an error when a developer defines a `ManyToManyField` with a `related_name` in a symmetrical or self-referential context. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
