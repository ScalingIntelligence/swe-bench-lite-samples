The primary focus is on identifying scenarios where developers might unintentionally or mistakenly define a related_name in such fields, leading to potential confusion or errors later on. The relevant code appears to be primarily located in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, particularly within the 'ManyToManyField' class and its methods. To address this, a check should be implemented within the 'ManyToManyField' class methods to raise an error when a related_name is defined under the specified conditions. The 'contribute_to_class' method in the 'ManyToManyField' class is likely where such a check would be implemented to ensure it works correctly according to Django's framework.",

The issue specifically mentions raising an error when a ManyToManyField is defined with the symmetrical argument and a related_name. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the `ManyToManyField` class and its `__init__` method are relevant, as they handle the initialization of the field with parameters like `related_name` and `symmetrical`. Additionally, the `contribute_to_class` method in the `RelatedField` class and its subclasses like `ManyToManyField` are crucial, as they contribute the field to the class definition and handle the related_name and symmetrical aspects during class contribution. These sections of code are the most relevant for implementing the proposed functionality to raise an error when a related_name is defined on a symmetrical ManyToManyField.",

This means that when a ManyToManyField is symmetrical or self-referential, the related_name attribute should not be allowed, and an error should be raised if a developer tries to define it. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans in the `ManyToManyField` class that handle the initialization and attribute setting, particularly focusing on the `related_name` attribute and the `symmetrical` flag. The code spans provided in the search results include the initialization of the `ManyToManyField` (`ManyToManyField.__init__`), the method responsible for contributing to the class definition (`ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`), and several validation and helper methods that may be relevant for potential checks or errors related to the `related_name` attribute. Based on the issue, the focus should be on enhancing the handling of the `related_name` attribute within the context of symmetrical ManyToMany relationships.",
