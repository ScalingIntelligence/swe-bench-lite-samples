This involves understanding how ManyToManyFields are implemented in Django and how the symmetrical attribute affects the behavior. From the search results, the key areas to focus on are the `ManyToManyField` class definition and its `__init__` method where the symmetrical attribute is handled. Additionally, the `contribute_to_class` method is crucial as it deals with how the related_name is set or modified based on the symmetrical attribute. These sections of code are directly relevant to the reported issue and will help in implementing the proposed solution to raise an error when a related_name is defined on a symmetrical ManyToManyField.\n\n1. **ManyToManyField Class Definition**: This is the base class for many-to-many relationships in Django which is relevant to the reported issue.\n2. **ManyToManyField.__init__ Method**: This method initializes the ManyToManyField instance and sets the symmetrical attribute. This is where the check for related_name and symmetrical could be added.\n3. **ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class Method**: This method contributes the field to the class, including setting the related_name based on the symmetrical attribute. It's important for understanding how related_name is currently handled and where an error could be raised if necessary.\n4. **Imports and Other Related Code**: These provide context and utilities used by the ManyToManyField class and its methods, such as lazy_related_operation for handling related models lazily.",
