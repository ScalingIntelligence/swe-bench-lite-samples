The goal is to ensure that an error is raised when a developer specifies a related_name attribute in such cases. The relevant code likely resides within the ManyToManyField class and its methods responsible for validation or contribution to class attributes. Focusing on the `contribute_to_class`, `contribute_to_related_class`, and `check` methods within the ManyToManyField class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` should help in identifying the necessary checks. Additionally, looking into `Model` class methods in `django/db/models/base.py` related to field checks might provide additional insights.",

The `__init__` method of `ManyToManyField` does handle `symmetrical` and `related_name` parameters, but there is no explicit validation to raise an error if `related_name` is set while `symmetrical` is `True`. The `contribute_to_class` method also processes these parameters but lacks the specific validation needed for the reported issue. It is likely that the validation should occur in the `check` method or a similar validation-specific method which is not shown in the provided context. Since the specific validation method (`check`) is not included in the file context, it is not possible to confirm if the relevant code to address the issue is fully present. This indicates a need for further investigation in the `check` method or a similar validation method that might handle this specific case.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
