Specifically, the `ManyToManyField.__init__` span is relevant as it sets the symmetrical attribute and handles the related_name parameter. The `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` span is also pertinent as it checks the relationship model and can be extended to include a check for the symmetrical attribute and related_name.

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
