The 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' span also plays a crucial role as it contains the logic for handling symmetrical relationships and related_name. These two spans directly address the issue by showing where and how symmetrical ManyToMany relationships are managed, including the handling of related_name.

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
