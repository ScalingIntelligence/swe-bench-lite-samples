From the provided search results, it's evident that the '__init__' method in the ManyToManyField class contains the logic for initializing the field and determining if it's symmetrical based on the 'to' parameter and RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT. This part of the code is crucial because it dictates the behavior of the field and could be a good place to implement the proposed change to raise an error when related_name is specified in these scenarios. However, the current implementation does not include any enforcement of this rule; instead, it only initializes the field without validation. For comprehensive coverage, it's also important to check the 'check' method, as this is where field-specific validation and error handling are typically implemented. In the search results, the 'check' method is shown, but it lacks specific checks related to the symmetrical property and related_name. Therefore, while the current search results cover the initialization and general validation of the ManyToManyField, they do not include the specific proposed check that would raise an error when a developer specifies a related_name on a symmetrical ManyToManyField. Further inspection is suggested, or additional search is needed for the exact validation point or to identify where such validation could be implemented.",

Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
