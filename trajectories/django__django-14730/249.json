To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle ManyToManyField initialization and validation. This includes ensuring that if the 'symmetrical' argument is passed, or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, the related field on the target model is not created. A potential solution could involve raising an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in these specific conditions.\n\nThe provided search results provide several relevant code spans. The 'ManyToManyField' class is of particular interest, as it contains the '__init__', 'check', and 'contribute_to_class' methods, which are involved in the initialization, validation, and class contribution processes for ManyToMany fields. The 'symmetrical' argument is handled in the '__init__' method where it is set based on the conditions provided.\n\nFurthermore, the related '_check_m2m_through_same_relationship' method in the 'Model' class is also relevant as it checks for issues in the ManyToMany relationships specifically through intermediary models. It's possible that extending this method or incorporating logic from it could help in identifying and preventing the use of related_name in symmetrical ManyToManyFields.\n\nGiven this context, the code spans marked with the ids 'ManyToManyField', 'ManyToManyField.__init__', 'ManyToManyField.check', 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class', and 'Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship' are the most relevant. This selection is based on their direct handling of ManyToManyField attributes and relationship validations.",

This would involve modifying the ManyToManyField class or the __init__ method within it to check if 'symmetrical' is True or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship and then raising an error if 'related_name' is also defined. Given the context and the search results, both provided in the file_context and search_results, it seems the primary focus should remain on the ManyToManyField class and its methods. The check for the 'symmetrical' attribute and the 'related_name' being set simultaneously should be added in the initialization (__init__) or possibly in the check method (check, though less likely, as it is currently involved more with consistency checks). By understanding the existing structure of the handling of ManyToManyFields and symmetrical relationships, these adjustments can be made to enforce the behavior requested in the issue. The existing code also provides examples on how to handle error raising and condition checking within Django's fields, thereby informing the strategic placement of the new condition.",

This part of the code needs inspection to see how symmetrical and related_name parameters interact.\n- Other methods within ManyToManyField, such as check and contribute_to_class, provide additional context on how related names are validated, particularly when a ManyToManyField is symmetrical.\n\nRelevant Search Results:\n- The search results include the lines where the symmetrical and related_name parameters are defined, along with how Django handles these cases internally in the contribute_to_class method.\n\nThese findings should be sufficient to implement or verify the error-raising mechanism against developers defining a related_name on symmetrical ManyToManyFields.",
