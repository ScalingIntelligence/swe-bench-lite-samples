The search results contain several relevant code spans in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, particularly in the ManyToManyField class definition and its methods. The __init__ method of ManyToManyField checks for the symmetrical argument and handles it accordingly. The contribute_to_class method also deals with the symmetrical attribute and adjusts the related_name if needed. These methods are crucial for understanding how the related_name is handled in symmetrical ManyToMany relationships and can be used for implementing the proposed error raising functionality. The 'django/db/models/base.py' file also contains a class method '_check_m2m_through_same_relationship' that is related to many-to-many relationships, but it seems more focused on checking for identical many-to-many relations through the same intermediate model, which is less directly related to the reported issue but still relevant as it involves many-to-many field checks. Overall, these code spans provide a good basis for understanding and implementing the functionality to raise an error when a related_name is defined on a symmetrical ManyToManyField.",

The reported issue requires identifying where in the codebase the ManyToManyField is defined, particularly focusing on the __init__ method to see how the symmetrical attribute and related_name are handled. The analysis should also consider how an error would be raised if a related_name is specified when symmetrical is True. The file context provided indicates that django/db/models/fields/related.py has already been identified as relevant, especially focusing on the ManyToManyField and its __init__ method. The search results confirm the presence of ManyToManyField and its __init__ method, which handles the related_name parameter along with the symmetrical parameter. These results provide the necessary context to determine where an error should be raised. Specifically, the ManyToManyField.__init__ method is crucial because it initializes the ManyToManyField instance and sets the symmetrical attribute. To implement the desired feature, checking should occur in this method if both symmetrical is True and related_name is provided. If both conditions are met, an error should be raised to prevent the developer from defining a related_name in this scenario.",

This involves identifying the relevant parts of code where the error should be raised if a 'related_name' is defined in such conditions. \n\nFrom the provided search results, the key sections are in the 'ManyToManyField' class within 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. The class method 'contribute_to_class' seems to be the most relevant, as it deals with the relationship names including 'related_name'. Additionally, the '__init__' method of 'ManyToManyField' also sets up the field and its attributes including 'related_name', which could be a place to perform checks or raise errors.\n\nThe '_check_relationship_model' method in 'ManyToManyField' also seems relevant, as it deals with checks on the relationship model. Although it primarily checks the relationship model itself and not directly for 'related_name', it's involved in checks that could be adapted to include raising an error for 'related_name' in symmetric relationships.\n\nConsidering these sections, it appears that 'ManyToManyField' is the most important class related to enforcing this issue, and within it, 'contribute_to_class', '__init__', and potentially '_check_relationship_model' functions are critical for implementing the described error raising behavior. However, the exact implementation of raising an error for symmetrical ManyToManyFields with 'related_name' remains to be addressed.\n\nThe analysis indicates that the search results cover the relevant codebases related to ManyToManyField and its symmetrical behavior. Therefore, the search task is likely complete for identifying the places in the codebase where the error-raising condition might be implemented.",
