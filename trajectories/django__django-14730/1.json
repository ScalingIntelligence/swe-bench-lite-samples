This requires identifying where in the ManyToManyField class and its initialization (__init__) the related_name and symmetrical attributes are handled. The search results provide a detailed look into the ManyToManyField class, particularly the __init__ method where the related_name and symmetrical parameters are initially processed. This section is crucial because it sets up the conditions under which related_name would cause confusion, specifically when the symmetrical argument is passed or when the relationship is self-referential. Additionally, the contribute_to_class method is relevant as it further processes the related_name attribute, especially in the context of symmetrical relationships and self-referential models. By focusing on these parts of the code, we can pinpoint the exact locations where checks or errors need to be added to address the reported issue.",
