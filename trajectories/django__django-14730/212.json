These sections handle how the field contributes to the class definition and related class, which is pivotal for addressing the issue. Within 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class', there's logic that adjusts the 'related_name' if the field is symmetrical or self-referential, indicating the exact location to implement the proposed error raising mechanism. Additional relevant sections are found in 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py', particularly '_check_m2m_through_same_relationship' which checks for redundancy in many-to-many relationships, and 'ManyToManyDescriptor' which deals with the descriptor for many-to-many fields.

The focus is on validation checks for `ManyToManyField` with conditions relating to `symmetrical` or self-referential relationships and the `related_name` parameter. The `ManyToManyField` class contains the `__init__` method where `symmetrical` is processed and the `contribute_to_class` method where `related_name` is handled based on `symmetrical`. Additionally, the `Model` class has the `_check_m2m_through_same_relationship` method that checks for certain conditions related to many-to-many relationships, though not directly for `symmetrical` or `related_name`. Based on the context provided, currently identified methods handle the required functionality, suggesting no further search is necessary.",
