This issue is particularly concerned with the behavior of ManyToManyField in Django's ORM when the 'symmetrical' argument is used or when the field is self-referential. The primary concern is that defining a 'related_name' under these circumstances can lead to confusion for developers, as the related field on the target model won't be created, and thus, it's proposed to raise an error in such cases.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are found within the initialization method of the ManyToManyField class. Specifically, the code that checks for the 'symmetrical' argument being None or pertains to self-referential relationships (where 'to' is equal to 'RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT'). The task at hand is to determine if an error should be raised when 'related_name' is provided under these conditions.\n\nThe relevant code spans that handle the initialization of ManyToManyField and the setting of the 'symmetrical' attribute are identified. These spans include the definition of the '__init__' method and the conditional logic that checks the value of 'symmetrical'. The entire section of the code that handles the 'rel' attribute initialization and the superclass initialization is also relevant, as it sets up the ManyToMany relationship and could be where the logic to raise an error should be implemented.\n\nGiven the current context, it seems that the search task is nearly complete. The identified spans provide sufficient context and details about how ManyToManyField is initialized and what checks are currently in place. The next step would likely involve adding the specific logic to raise an error if both 'symmetrical' is True (or derived from a self-referential relationship) and 'related_name' is not None.",

This issue is in line with the requirement that when the ManyToManyField is symmetrical, the related field on the target model is not created, which can lead to confusion. It is proposed to raise an error in such cases to clarify this constraint to developers. The current review of the code in the 'ManyToManyField' class shows that the '__init__' method checks for the 'symmetrical' argument and conditionally sets it based on whether the field is a self-referential relationship. However, it does not currently check or raise an error if the 'related_name' is specified under these conditions. Therefore, the relevant code spans should focus on identifying where this check could be added and how to handle the error condition.",
