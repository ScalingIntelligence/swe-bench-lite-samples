The reported issue suggests raising an error when developers define a related_name on a symmetrical ManyToManyField. The search results reveal several relevant code spans within the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file: 1. The `ManyToManyField` class definition including its `__init__` method. 2. The `contribute_to_class` method within `ManyToManyField` which handles various attributes and relationships during class contribution. 3. The `MultipleObjectsReturned` exception handling which might be indirectly relevant to the handling of multiple related objects, though not directly addressing the symmetrical issue. Given these findings, the most relevant spans are those pertaining to the `ManyToManyField` class and its interactions, particularly the `__init__` and `contribute_to_class` methods where the symmetrical and related_name attributes are set and checked. These spans provide the context needed for the proposed enhancement to raise an error when a related_name is defined for a symmetrical ManyToManyField.",

This implies that the code should contain logic to detect if a `ManyToManyField` is symmetrical and raise an error if `related_name` is specified. The provided search results include the definition of `ManyToManyField` and its `__init__` method, which can be used to introduce such a check. The `related_name` parameter initialization can be enhanced to include this validation logic. The existing `ManyToManyField.__init__` method does not currently perform this check, making it a relevant starting point for modifying the code. The `contribute_to_class` method is also important because it handles the `related_name` assignment, and any modifications here must consider the symmetrical properties to ensure the integrity of the related objects specified. It is crucial that the interactions between symmetrical relationships and related names are carefully managed to prevent potential bugs and confusion for developers. Ensuring the check is integrated early in the process, such as in `__init__`, before related operations take place, ensures consistency and minimizes side effects. The provided context already includes the methods `__init__` and `contribute_to_class` along with the logic that handles symmetrical relationships, which can be utilized to integrate this new functionality. Therefore, the identified spans from the context are directly relevant to introducing this feature, and the search results confirm these spans are intact, previewing the key elements necessary to implement the feature. The intersections of symmetry in relationships and related name assignments provided by `ManyToManyField` make this an intricate consideration, requiring detailed investigation to ensure all components meet feature outcomes.",
