Additionally, the `_check_m2m_through_same_relationship` method in the `Model` class from `django/db/models/base.py` is relevant as it performs checks on many-to-many relationships, indicating potential places to insert additional validation.

The issue aims to raise an error when a developer defines a related_name on a symmetrical ManyToManyField, as there would not be a target model for this related_name. The key elements to focus on include 'ManyToManyField' class and its '__init__' and 'contribute_to_class' methods, especially where the attributes 'symmetrical' and 'related_name' are handled. In the search results, I observed that both files 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py' contain relevant code spans that manipulate 'symmetrical' and 'related_name'. Specifically, within 'ManyToManyField.__init__', the parameter 'symmetrical' gets its value set based on whether the field is self-referential. Additionally, in 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class', the behavior for setting 'related_name' changes based on the 'symmetrical' attribute. These code spans are crucial for understanding how the related_name is dynamically set or altered. Currently, there isn't a direct error raising mechanism in place within these methods to address the use of 'related_name' in a symmetrical relationship, as per the issue description, suggesting a necessary addition to comply with the issue's objective. Therefore, these chunks of code serve as the basis for potentially adding such error handling or modifying existing behavior according to the proposed change. Therefore, the search task is still continuous, as we need to implement the error raising mechanism as part of the solution to resolve the issue.",
