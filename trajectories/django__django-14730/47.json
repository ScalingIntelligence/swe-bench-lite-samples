In the provided search results, the `ManyToManyField` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` contains the relevant logic for handling `related_name`, `symmetrical`, and `through` parameters. The `__init__` method and the `contribute_to_class` method of `ManyToManyField` are notable for checking and setting these parameters. These methods could be extended to raise an error if `related_name` is set alongside `symmetrical=True`. Additionally, the `ManyToManyRel` class in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` is relevant as it defines the relationship attributes, including `symmetrical` and `related_name`, and could be involved in the validation process. Thus, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and implementing the solution to the reported issue.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
