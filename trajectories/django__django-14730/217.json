This requires identifying the relevant code spans that deal with the initialization, contribution to class, and related class functionality of ManyToManyFields, particularly when the symmetrical argument is involved. From the search results, the identified code spans include the __init__ method of ManyToManyField, which initializes the field and handles the symmetrical argument. The contribute_to_class method is also relevant as it further processes the field's contribution to the class, especially when dealing with recursive relationships. These spans directly address the conditions mentioned in the issue, making them relevant to the task of raising an error when related_name is defined under the specified conditions. The analysis of these spans indicates that they contain the necessary logic to implement the proposed changes effectively.",

The current context already has relevant spans involving these methods, and the new search results further confirm the relevance of these spans. The analysis involves checking how the symmetrical attribute and related_name are handled, and ensuring that the error-raising logic can be appropriately integrated. The identified spans from the search results align well with the requirements of the issue, specifically looking for code spans where the related_name and symmetrical properties of ManyToManyField are defined or used. The search results include the initialization of ManyToManyField and how it contributes to the class, which are directly relevant to resolving the reported issue. Given this comprehensive understanding, the identified spans from both the current context and the new search results are accurately representing the relevant parts of the codebase needed to address the issue.",
