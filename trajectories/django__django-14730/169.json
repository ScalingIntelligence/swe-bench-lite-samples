This may cause confusion because the related field on the target model is not created under these conditions. The task is to locate the part of the code responsible for checking and possibly raising an error when a developer does this. Relevant files have been identified in the `django/db/models` directory, particularly in `related.py`, `base.py`, `reverse_related.py`, and `related_descriptors.py`. The focus should be on the `ManyToManyField` class and related checks.",

The issue specifies that an error should be raised when the related_name is defined while the ManyToManyField is symmetrical or self-referential. This check should be implemented within the __init__ method to promptly notify developers of this misuse. Given the current codebase context, no relevant code has been identified yet, and the provided search results include the relevant Django ManyToManyField class with its __init__ method. This method already contains some initial checks, such as verifying if the 'to' parameter is a valid model or string. To comply with the reported issue, an additional check should be added to this __init__ method to raise an error if the symmetrical attribute is true and a related_name is provided.",

There's no explicit error-raising mechanism observed that would handle the scenario where `related_name` is defined when `symmetrical` is set to True or in self-referential relationships. The method does check for symmetrical relationships and adjusts the related name accordingly, but it doesn't seem to validate against defining a `related_name` specifically under those conditions.

The specific problem arises when a ManyToManyField is symmetrical or self-referential, as the related field on the target model is not created, leading to potential confusion if a related_name is specified. The solution proposed is to raise an error in such cases.\n\nThe existing code context provided includes the ManyToManyField class and its __init__ method. The key points to consider from the issue are the handling of the 'related_name' parameter and the 'symmetrical' attribute of the ManyToManyField. The search results confirm the existence of these attributes and methods in the ManyToManyField class.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant section is the ManyToManyField.__init__ method. Here, the 'related_name' and 'symmetical' parameters are present and can be used to determine if an error should be raised. The current state of the code does not raise an error when 'related_name' is defined along with 'symmetrical'. Implementing the proposed change would involve adding a check within the __init__ method of the ManyToManyField class to raise an error if both 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' are defined.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans of code that are relevant to the reported issue are:\n1. ManyToManyField.__init__\n2. ManyToManyField.check\n\nThese spans cover the initialization of the ManyToManyField and the associated checks that could be extended to include the new error condition.",
