This involves understanding the behavior of ManyToManyField when symmetrical is True or in self-referential relationships, where no related field is created on the target model. The provided code spans from 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' include parts of the ManyToManyField class, which is central to the issue. Specifically, the __init__ method of ManyToManyField handles the initialization of the field, including the symmetrical and related_name parameters. The contribute_to_class method also deals with how the field contributes to the model class, including handling symmetrical relationships. The _check_relationship_model method includes checks related to the relationship model, which could be relevant for raising an error if a related_name is defined inappropriately for symmetrical relationships. Therefore, the identified spans directly relate to the handling and initialization of ManyToManyFields, including checks for symmetrical relationships and the related_name attribute.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
