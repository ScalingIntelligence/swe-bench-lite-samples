Specifically, I should focus on the parts of the code that deal with the `symmetrical` argument, `related_name`, and error handling. I've found several spans that are relevant: 'ManyToManyField.__init__' handles the initialization of the ManyToManyField and sets the symmetrical attribute. 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' contributes the field to the class and adjusts related names based on symmetry. Finally, 'ManyToManyField.check' provides a method for field-level validation, suggesting a potential place for adding an error check based on the conditions stated in the issue. These spans cover the essential aspects of ManyToManyField handling and should be sufficient for implementing the required functionality to raise an error when a related_name is defined on a symmetrical ManyToManyField.",
