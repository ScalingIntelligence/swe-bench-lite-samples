            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, we need to identify the code responsible for handling ManyToManyFields with the symmetrical argument and related_name. The goal is to ensure that an error is raised when a developer attempts to define `related_name` on a symmetrical ManyToManyField or on a self-referential ManyToMany relationship.\n\nStarting with the import section, the necessary modules and classes are imported but primarily set up the environment for defining fields and relations rather than directly addressing the issue.\n\nThe `ManyToManyField` class definition (`span id='ManyToManyField'`) appears relevant as it specifies the handling of many-to-many relationships. The constructor (`__init__` method in `span id='ManyToManyField.__init__'`) is particularly interesting because it initializes the field's properties, including `related_name` and `symmetrical`, reflecting the conditions of the issue.\n\nThe check method (`span id='ManyToManyField.check'`) is also relevant as it performs various checks on the field, including potentially where validation against conflicting configurations like a symmetrical ManyToManyField with a related_name might be implemented. However, no direct error raising is observed in the provided span.\n\nThe `contribute_to_class` method (`span id='ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class'`) is another vital part. It customizes the behavior of the model's class affecting how relations are handled, including settings the related name dynamically or statically based on the symmetrical attribute. This makes it a candidate span for implementing or adapting logic to raise errors in the desired conditions.\n\nThere seems to be no direct error-raising logic associated with the reported issue in the provided spans, suggesting that either current logic doesn't catch the situation or it might be located elsewhere in the codebase or other configuration files.\n\nConsidering the granularity of spans and the lack of immediate method to raise an error or log such warnings regarding the specific conditions of the issue, future code inspections may leverage these identified spans as foundations to update or append such error-handling mechanisms.\n\nGiven the context, the relevance of each identified span aligns well with understanding the current comportment of the `ManyToManyField`, parameters involved in the descriptor creation entitled `related_name`, which needs frustrated, and bypassing any existing validation checks.",

  "initial_message": "Prevent developers from defining a related_name on symmetrical ManyToManyFields\nDescription\n\t\nIn ManyToManyField, if the symmetrical argument is passed, or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, the related field on the target model is not created. However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
