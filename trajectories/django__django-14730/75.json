The spans include definitions and initializations of various related fields like ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, along with their respective descriptors and relations. The span 'ManyToManyField.__init__' is particularly relevant as it deals with the initialization of ManyToManyField, including handling the 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' parameters. The span 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' also plays a key role in how ManyToManyField contributes to the class it's defined on, and it checks for the symmetrical relationship and modifies the related_name accordingly. These two spans are likely the most relevant to addressing the issue as they directly involve the creation and configuration of ManyToManyField instances in Django.",
