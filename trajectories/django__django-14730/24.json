The ManyToManyField class is examined for methods that initialize these parameters (__init__) and methods that perform checks on their validity (check, _check_ignored_options). The relevance of Each of these spans is checked against the requirement to raise an error when a ManyToManyField is defined with symmetrical=True and a related_name is provided. Notably, the checks method in ManyToManyField inherits from RelatedField, which includes an inspection of the related_name validity (_check_related_name_is_valid method). This suggests that the functionality to raise an error for such conditions might already be partially implemented in RelatedField or its inherited methods. Further investigation into exactly how symmetrical and related_name are validated is necessary to ensure the error is raised under the correct conditions. While the search results provide a good starting point, they do not directly contain the code that would explicitly raise an error when a related_name is defined on a symmetrical ManyToManyField. Therefore, the task is not yet complete, and further codebase exploration is needed to find the specific validation logic or to determine the need for additional error handling.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
