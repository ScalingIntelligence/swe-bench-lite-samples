The focus is on identifying code related to ManyToManyField initialization and its handling of the 'symmetrical' argument and 'related_name' parameter. Given the context, the relevant code spans should detail how ManyToManyField is defined, how it handles the 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' parameters, and how it contributes to the class. The search results provide several potential code spans, including the `ManyToManyField` class definition, its `__init__` method, and its `contribute_to_class` method. These spans are crucial as they show how the ManyToManyField is initialized and how it interacts with the 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' parameters during class contribution. Specifically, the `__init__` method checks for the 'related_name' parameter and adjusts the symmetrical behavior, while the `contribute_to_class` method further processes the 'related_name' based on the symmetrical setting. These spans are directly relevant to the issue, as they address the core functionality associated with the reported problem.",
