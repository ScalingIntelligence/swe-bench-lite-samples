To address this, we need to identify the parts of the code responsible for handling ManyToManyFields, especially where the symmetrical argument and related_name are managed. The search results include several code spans that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. 'ManyToManyField.__init__': This method initializes the ManyToManyField and handles the symmetrical argument. It checks if the 'to' parameter is a model or string and sets the symmetrical attribute based on the relationship type. This is directly related to the symmetrical property mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class': This method contributes the ManyToManyField to the class and manages the related_name property, especially when the symmetrical attribute is set and the relationship is recursive or self-referential. This is crucial for understanding how related_name interacts with symmetrical relationships.\n\n3. 'ManyToManyField.check': This method includes checks for the ManyToManyField, including checking the unique constraints and the relationship model. Although not directly dealing with the related_name error, understanding the checks can provide context for where an error might be raised.\n\nThese spans provide a foundational level of understanding for how ManyToManyFields are managed and how symmetrical relationships affect the related_name. To fully address the issue, identifying where and how to raise an error when a symmetrical ManyToManyField has a related_name defined would be the next step. This might involve extending or modifying the 'check' method or adding another specific check within the ManyToManyField class.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
