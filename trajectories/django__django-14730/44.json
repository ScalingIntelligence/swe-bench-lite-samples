The provided search results include the 'ManyToManyField' class definition and its '__init__' method where the symmetrical argument is handled. Additionally, the 'check' method in the 'ManyToManyField' class is relevant for validation and could potentially be the place to implement the check for a related_name with symmetrical ManyToManyFields. The 'resolve_relation' function, while not directly related to the ManyToManyField, might be useful for understanding and resolving model relationships, which can be relevant when dealing with self-referential relationships. Overall, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive set of functionalities and checks that could be expanded to include the proposed error condition.",

This aligns with the issue's requirement to raise an error when a 'related_name' is defined on a symmetrical 'ManyToManyField'.

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
