            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves preventing developers from defining a related_name on symmetrical ManyToManyFields. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with ManyToManyField initialization, especially where symmetrical relationships and related_name are handled. From the provided search results, several spans are relevant:\n\n1. **ManyToManyField.__init__**: This span is critical as it contains the initialization logic for ManyToManyField, including handling of the symmetrical argument and related_name. It checks if the 'to' parameter refers to the same model (self-referential) and sets the symmetrical attribute accordingly. This is where we can enforce the proposed error if related_name is provided alongside a symmetrical relationship.\n\n2. **ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class**: This span is also crucial as it deals with contributing the ManyToManyField to the class definition. It handles symmetrical relationships by setting the related_name appropriately if the relationship is symmetrical or self-referential. This is another place where we can enforce the error condition.\n\n3. **ManyToManyField.check**: Although this span is primarily for checking field attributes and returning warnings or errors, it doesn't directly handle the symmetrical and related_name issue. However, it might be useful to add an additional check here to ensure no related_name is defined when symmetrical is True.\n\n4. **ManyToManyField._check_ignored_options**: This span checks for ignored options and provides warnings. It doesn't directly address the issue but could be considered for adding an error or warning related to the symmetrical and related_name combination.\n\nThe identified spans are essential for modifying the ManyToManyField behavior to raise an error when related_name is defined in a symmetrical relationship. The specific implementation would involve adding validation logic within the '__init__' and 'contribute_to_class' methods to check for the presence of related_name when symmetrical is True and raising a meaningful error in such cases.",

Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
