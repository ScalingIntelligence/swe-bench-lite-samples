From the given search results, the relevant code spans are those that define the ManyToManyField class, its __init__ method, and its contribute_to_class method. These sections of code are crucial because they handle the initialization and class contribution of ManyToManyFields, which includes the setting of 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' parameters. Specifically, the __init__ method checks and sets the 'symmetrical' attribute based on whether the ManyToManyField is self-referential, and the contribute_to_class method adjusts the 'related_name' if the relationship is symmetrical or hidden. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

This involves understanding how `ManyToManyField` and its `symmetrical` attribute interact with `related_name`. I need to examine the `ManyToManyField` class and its methods for handling symmetrical relationships and `related_name` settings. Taking into account the given file context and search results, both provided data seem to cover aspects of `ManyToManyField` and its initialization with `related_name`. Particularly, I need to pay close attention to the `__init__` and `contribute_to_class` methods of `ManyToManyField` to ensure we capture the correct conditions for raising an error when `related_name` is set on a symmetrical relationship. Below steps are my thoughts followed: \n1. **Review `file_context`**\n   - Identified relevant spans: `RelatedField.__init__`, `RelatedField.contribute_to_class`, `ManyToManyField.__init__`, `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`. Here, `ManyToManyField` is the main concern for setting restrictions on `related_name` based on the `symmetrical` attribute.\n2. **Review `search_results`**\n   - Spans that are particularly relevant due to involvement in handling `related_name` and `symmetrical` logic include: `ManyToManyField.__init__` and `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`.\n\nBy analyzing these sections, I can identify the exact points in code where checks on symmetrical relationships alongside `related_name` should be implemented or modified to enforce the desired behavior. The current code does provide some examples of how `related_name` is managed but does not explicitly check for the combination of `symmetrical` being true and `related_name` being set, which is the crux of the issue.",

The `__init__` method is where the field is initialized, so adding validation there would provide immediate feedback. The `contribute_to_class` method is also relevant for deeper integration with the class where the field is being added. The `RelatedField` class is also present, which might be needed for a more generalized solution.
