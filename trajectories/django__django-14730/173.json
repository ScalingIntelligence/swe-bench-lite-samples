Specifically, the '__init__' method of ManyToManyField is where the symmetrical argument is handled and the related_name is processed. This is crucial for understanding how and when related_name is used and how it could be restricted. Additionally, the 'contribute_to_class' method is relevant as it handles how the field contributes to the class definition, which includes setting up related_names for symmetrical relationships. The search task is not complete based on the given context, as the code does not explicitly include checks that would raise an error when a related_name is defined for a symmetrical ManyToManyField.

If `symmetrical` is `True`, setting `related_name` is potentially problematic since it implies a self-referential relationship.\n\n2. **Checking the Contribution to Class Method**: The method `contribute_to_class` (span id 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class') plays a crucial role in managing and resolving relationships. However, if `symmetrical` and `related_name` are both specified, this needs to be addressed by an error mechanism.\n\n3. **Checking Mechanism**: The check method (`ManyToManyField.check`, span id 'ManyToManyField.check') could be a suitable place to implement validation to raise an error if a `related_name` is set when `symmetrical` is `True`.\n\n4. **Consideration of Existing Error Checking**: The existing check method provides a pattern for adding this constraint. However, none of the current check methods specifically address the combination of `related_name` and `symmetrical` attributes in a ManyToManyField. This indicates a gap where new functionality should be added.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans in the search results are directly related to the initialization, class contribution, and the error checking mechanisms of ManyToManyFields. The suggested implementation of error-raising should involve enhancing the check method to accommodate this required functionality.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
