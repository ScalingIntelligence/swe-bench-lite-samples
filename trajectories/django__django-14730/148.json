This involves understanding the ManyToManyField class and its behavior with symmetrical relationships. The goal is to identify where in the code this check should be implemented to raise an error when a related_name is defined under these conditions. Two potential points of intervention are the 'check' method within the ManyToManyField class, as well as the 'contribute_to_class' method, which could be where the validation or error raising should occur. Additionally, considering the symmetrical argument's impact, the '_check_relationship_model' method within the ManyToManyField class could also be a relevant place to look.",
