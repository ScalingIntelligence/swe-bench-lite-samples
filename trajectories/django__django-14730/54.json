The goal is to find where the 'related_name' is processed and where the 'symmetrical' attribute is checked. From the provided context, it appears that the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file contains classes and methods that deal with related fields, including ManyToManyField.

To address this, we need to identify the part of the codebase where ManyToManyField initialization and validation take place. From the provided search results, several code spans within the ManyToManyField class are relevant:\n\n1. **ManyToManyField.__init__**: This span is crucial as it defines the initialization behavior of the ManyToManyField. Within this method, there's a section that sets the symmetrical property and a check for the intermediary model and db_table. Adjustments here could include raising an error if a related_name is provided and symmetrical is True.\n\n2. **ManyToManyField.check**: Although the current implementation is a placeholder, this method is intended for validation checks. Enhancing this method to include a check for the condition mentioned in the issue would be appropriate.\n\n3. **ManyToManyField._check_unique**: The uniqueness checks within this method could be extended to include the scenario if needed, but primarily 'check' is a more logical place to add our specific validation.\n\n4. **ManyToManyField._check_ignored_options**: This method checks for various options that are ignored or raise warnings. It could be useful to include a specific check or warning for the symmetrical and related_name combination.\n\nGiven these insights, enhancing the 'check' method and possibly refining the initialization in '__init__' to include a validation error when both related_name and symmetrical are specified is the direct approach to solving the issue.",

Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
