The search results show the ManyToManyField class definition in django/db/models/fields/related.py, which includes the __init__ method where the symmetrical attribute is set. This method would be the most relevant place to implement the check for the related_name attribute when symmetrical is True. Additionally, the contribute_to_class method, which contributes the field to the model class, could be another relevant place to implement such a check if needed.

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
