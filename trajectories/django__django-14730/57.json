To address this, we need to identify relevant code spans that deal with the initialization and validation of ManyToManyFields, especially where the 'symmetrical' attribute and 'related_name' are handled. We should look for code spans where the 'symmetrical' attribute is set and checked, and where 'related_name' is processed. We also need to ensure that if 'symmetrical' is True, or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, no 'related_name' should be allowed and an error should be raised. The 'ManyToManyField' class and its methods are particularly relevant, as well as the 'ManyToManyRel' class which handles the reverse relationship. The 'check' method in 'ManyToManyField' should also be reviewed to ensure it includes validation for this condition. The current context doesn't provide any relevant code identified yet, so our analysis is aimed at the new search results. We will parse these results to identify code spans that deal with the initialization, properties, and validation of ManyToManyFields, focusing on sections where 'symmetrical' and 'related_name' are involved.",

However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
