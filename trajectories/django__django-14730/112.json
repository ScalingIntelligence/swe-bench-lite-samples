The search results provide several relevant code spans from Django's source code that are likely related to handling ManyToManyFields and their properties, such as 'symmetrical', 'related_name', and validation checks. The spans 'ManyToManyField.__init__' and 'ManyToManyField.check' are particularly relevant as they deal directly with the initialization and validation of ManyToManyFields, including handling the 'related_name' and 'symmetrical' attributes. Adding an error check in these sections to raise an error when both 'related_name' is defined and 'symmetrical' is True would likely address the reported issue. Other spans such as '_check_relationship_model' and '_check_table_uniqueness' are also relevant for understanding how the relationship is established and validated, but less directly related to the immediate issue.

Additionally, the '__init__' method of this class processes the 'related_name' parameter, potentially setting it to a specific value if the relationship is symmetrical. The 'check' method of 'ManyToManyField' also contains several checks related to the integrity of the field, indicating Django's vigilance in ensuring data consistency and preventing misuse. Given these existing mechanisms, they do not explicitly prevent the setting of 'related_name' for symmetrical ManyToManyFields but rather handle their behavior differently.

The issue focuses on raising an error when a `related_name` is defined under certain conditions (when the field is symmetrical or self-referential). The provided context and search results contain several relevant sections from `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, which define the `ManyToManyField` class, its initialization, and validation checks. Specifically, the `ManyToManyField.__init__` and `ManyToManyField.check` methods are pertinent as they handle the initialization of the field and its post-initialization checks respectively. We are particularly interested in the `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` method, which currently contains checks for various conditions related to the intermediary models. To implement the new requirement, a new check or an amendment to the existing checks within `ManyToManyField.check` is necessary to include a validation that raises an error if `related_name` is defined and the field is symmetrical.",

However, the current implementation of `_check_relationship_model` does not explicitly check for the condition where `related_name` is defined while `symmetrical=True`. This confirms the need for a new check or an extension of the existing method to enforce the error when `related_name` is used with `symmetrical=True`. The context also includes the `ForeignKey` and `ForeignObject` classes which are relevant as they illustrate how similar checks for uniqueness and foreign keys are implemented. However, specific checks for `related_name` with `symmetrical=True` are absent. Thus, while the context is relevant, it lacks the explicit check needed to complete the functionality as per the reported issue.",

Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n"
