In the provided search results, several relevant code spans can be identified in the ManyToManyField class and its methods:\n\n1. The **ManyToManyField.__init__** span shows the initialization of ManyToManyField, where the symmetrical parameter is handled. This is crucial because it determines whether the relationship is symmetrical.\n2. The **RelatedField.__init__** and **RelatedField.contribute_to_class** spans show the handling of the related_name parameter. This is where the related_name can be checked or modified.\n3. The **ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class** span is important as it sets the related_name based on whether the relationship is symmetrical or not.\n4. The **RelatedField.check** span is a good candidate for adding a check to raise an error if a related_name is specified for a symmetrical ManyToManyField.\n\nThese spans collectively cover the lifecycle of a ManyToManyField, from initialization to class contribution and checking, making them suitable for implementing the proposed error raising functionality when a related_name is wrongly specified for a symmetrical relationship.",

However, there is no explicit error raised when a developer mistakenly defines a 'related_name' under these conditions. The relevant sections of code that need to be examined further are the '__init__' method of 'ManyToManyField' and the 'contribute_to_class' method, which are responsible for initializing and setting up the field respectively. These methods should be reviewed to see if they can be improved to raise an error when a 'related_name' is defined under potentially confusing conditions, as per the reported issue. The existing code already sets the 'related_name' to a special value when 'symmetrical' is True or when the relationship is recursive, which indicates that the code is aware of these conditions but lacks the validation to raise an error on inappropriate use of 'related_name'.",

Specifically, the constructor '__init__' sets the symmetrical attribute, and the 'contribute_to_class' method handles the related_name for symmetrical relationships. These aspects align with the task of raising an error when a symmetrical ManyToManyField has a related_name defined. However, the 'check' method, which is responsible for running validations, does not currently include a validation for this specific condition. Therefore, while the relevant class and constructor are identified, the specific check needed to raise the error is not yet implemented.",
