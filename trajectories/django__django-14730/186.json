These are critical sections for implementing or modifying to introduce an error when a related_name is defined under the specified condition.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n- 'ManyToManyField': This is the class definition of ManyToManyField, which is directly related to the issue.\n- 'ManyToManyField.__init__': Here is the initialization logic for ManyToManyField. The handling of the symmetrical attribute and related_name are crucial as per the issue.\n- 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class': This method is responsible for adding the ManyToManyField to the class. The logic here affects how the field is integrated and could potentially manage errors or warning signals regarding the use of related_name with symmetrical attributes.\n\nAdditional potential relevant parts could include the 'check' method to see if there are validations in place or that could be enhanced for this condition, but with the given results, the three mentioned methods are most pertinent.",
