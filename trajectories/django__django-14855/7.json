The problem seems to be localized to the 'get_admin_url' method in 'django.contrib.admin.helpers', which doesn't account for the 'current_app' parameter. To address this, the user has modified the 'get_admin_url' method to include 'current_app' parameter, but they seek feedback on potential side effects and the need for comprehensive testing. Given the specific nature of the issue, the focus should be on the 'helpers.py' and 'options.py' files within 'django/contrib/admin/', particularly looking for instances of 'get_admin_url' and 'current_app' usage to understand the system's context better.",

The user has identified that the default implementation of `get_admin_url` in `django.contrib.admin.helpers` does not account for custom admin site names, leading to URLs that start with '/admin/' rather than '/custom-admin/' for ForeignKey fields listed in `readonly_fields`. The user has provided a potential fix by adding the `current_app` parameter to the `reverse` function in `get_admin_url`.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found within `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` and `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py`. The `get_admin_url` method in `AdminReadonlyField` is particularly relevant as it directly handles the URL generation. The user's suggested fix could be directly applicable here. Additionally, the `ChangeList` class in `main.py` is relevant as it handles listing and displaying of models in the admin interface, which is closely related to the functionality affected by the issue.\n\nGiven these points, the relevant spans to address the reported issue are:\n- The `get_admin_url` method in `AdminReadonlyField` for its direct relevance to the URL generation problem.\n- The `ChangeList` class for its involvement in admin interface listing and model display, which could be indirectly affected by URL generation issues.\n\nThese identified spans should be enough to understand and potentially implement the user's suggested fix or to further investigate the issue and uncover any potential side effects.",
