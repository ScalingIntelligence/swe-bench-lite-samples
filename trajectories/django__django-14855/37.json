(See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\n\turl_name,\n\targs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\n\tcurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this. Mostly looking for feedback whether I'm on the right track.\n"
