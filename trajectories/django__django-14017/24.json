The minimal example provided shows that Exists(...) & Q(...) works, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError due to the missing implementation of the __rand__ method in the Q class. This inconsistency suggests that the commutative property of these operations is not fully supported.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file, specifically in the Q class definition and its methods. The methods `__and__` and `_combine` are crucial as they handle the combination of Q objects. The TypeError occurs in the `_combine` method when the other object is not an instance of Q, which suggests that the Exists object does not support the AND operation with Q objects in this context.\n\nIn the `django/db/models/expressions.py` file, the Exists class is defined, which inherits from Subquery. The Combinable class also contains methods related to bitwise operations, including `__and__` and `__rand__`, which might be relevant if the Exists object is expected to support these operations.\n\nTo address the issue, the `__rand__` method should be implemented in the Q class to handle the reverse operation when an Exists object is on the left side of the & operator.

There is also a Combinable class that defines __and__ and __rand__ methods, but these methods raise a NotImplementedError for bitwise operations, which suggests these are not the correct methods to look at for boolean combinations like those involving Q and Exists.
