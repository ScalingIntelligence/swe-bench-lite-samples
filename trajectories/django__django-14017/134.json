Specifically, the Q class in `query_utils.py` has methods for __and__, __or__, and __invert__, which are all implicated in this issue.\n\nThe Exists class in `expressions.py`, derived from Subquery, is also relevant. This class handles negation and SQL expression generation but does not currently have methods to handle reversed operations directly, such as __rand__.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are:\n- The Q class definition and its __and__, __or__, and __invert__ methods.\n- The Exists class definition and its __invert__ method, which deals with negation. There's no __rand__ method identified, which might be critical for allowing the appropriate handling of the situation described in the issue.",

The key elements here are the 'Q' and 'Exists' classes and their respective methods for bitwise operations. The error indicates that the '__and__' method for the 'Q' class is raising a TypeError when combining with an 'Exists' object. Reading through the provided context, the 'Q' class defines '__and__' and '__or__' methods, but not '__rand__'. The search results show a 'Combinable' class with a '__rand__' method that raises a NotImplementedError. This suggests that the 'Q' class, which likely inherits from 'Combinable', might be missing an overridden '__rand__' method to handle 'Exists' objects properly. This is likely causing the TypeError because the 'Exists' object is being handled as `other` in the '__and__' method of 'Q', and the method does not know how to handle non-Q objects directly (as per the 'TypeError: <django.db.models.expressions.Exists object at 0x7fc18dd21400>' error in the issue). To resolve this, the 'Q' class likely needs an overridden '__rand__' method that can handle 'Exists' objects, or additional logic in the existing methods to support the functionality correctly without TypeError.",
