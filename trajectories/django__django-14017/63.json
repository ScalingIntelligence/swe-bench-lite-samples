The error indicates that Exists objects are not recognized when combining with Q using the '&' operator in this order. The issue suggests that the & operator should be commutative for Q-Exists pairs, implying that both Exists() & Q() and Q() & Exists() should work. The error trace suggests that there's a missing definition of __rand__ in the Exists class or its parent class Combinable. In the provided search results, the Combinable class does define __and__ but not __rand__, which might be the root cause of the issue. This missing method could explain why Q() & Exists() raises a TypeError. The Exists class itself inherits from Subquery and does not override the __and__ or __rand__ methods from Combinable, which would be necessary for handling the commutative nature of the '&' operator with Q objects. Based on this analysis, it is likely that defining __rand__ in the Combinable class or the Exists class could resolve this issue.",
