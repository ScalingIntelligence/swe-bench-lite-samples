The primary focus is on the __and__ and __rand__ methods in the Q class and Combinable class, as these methods handle the & operator behavior. The search results provide code snippets that define __and__ and __rand__ in the Combinable class and the _combine method in the Q class. Additionally, the Exists class definition is included, although no direct __and__ or __rand__ methods are found there. The key identification is on the behaviors defined under the Q and Combinable classes, which control how the & operator interacts with Q and Exists objects. The provided code details the expected behavior of the & operator and reveals that the __rand__ method in the Combinable class raises a NotImplementedError, which might be a clue as to why the TypeError is occurring. Since the issue specifies that a missing __rand__ definition might be the cause, the relevance of this code to the issue is clear. The focus should shift towards ensuring that __rand__ is properly implemented or handled in the context of Exists and Q objects, potentially resolving the TypeError.",

This aligns with the user's suspicion that a missing definition for `__rand__` might be the cause.\n\nReviewing the provided context, we see that in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file, the `Q` class raises a `TypeError` in the `_combine` method if the `other` object is not an instance of `Q`. Additionally, the `Combinable` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` has methods defined for `__and__` and `__rand__`, but `__rand__` raises a `NotImplementedError` instead of handling the existence check.\n\nThe search results reaffirm the presence of these methods in the `Combinable` class, specifically highlighting that `__rand__` is not implemented for the `Exists` class integration with `Q`. This confirms the hypothesis that the lack of proper handling for reverse-order operations involving `Exists` and `Q` objects is causing the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue would involve method definitions for `__rand__` in the `Combinable` class to properly handle the combination with `Q` objects.",
