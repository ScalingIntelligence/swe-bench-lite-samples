The error suggests that `Q` does not handle the `&` operator correctly when combined with `Exists`. Since `Exists` is an expression and `Q` is a query utility, it might be necessary to look into the interaction between these two classes. Given the provided context, it seems relevant to investigate the `Q` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and the `Exists` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` to understand how they handle combining operations. Additionally, checking the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` could be beneficial as it deals with combining queries.",

Specifically, it raises an error when the order is Q() & Exists(...), whereas Exists(...) & Q() works without an issue. This suggests that the implementation might be missing a definition of __rand__ method in the Q class. Analyzing the provided search results, particularly in the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' file, I've identified that the Q class does indeed contain methods for combining Q objects using the '&' operator (__and__) and includes a check for the type of the other object, raising a TypeError if it is not an instance of Q. However, there's no mention or definition of the __rand__ method, which could explain the error encountered when Exists is placed before Q in the 'and' operation. Based on this analysis, I believe the relevant code spans to address this issue would focus on modifying the Q class to include the __rand__ method or adjust the existing __and__ method to handle such commutative operations with Exists objects. Thus, I've identified the relevant portions of the code where changes might need to be made to resolve this issue regarding the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py'.",
