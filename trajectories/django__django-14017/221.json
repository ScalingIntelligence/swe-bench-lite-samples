Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` fails, while `Exists(...) & Q()` works. This suggests a commutative issue with the `__and__` method in the Q class. The error occurs because the `__and__` method in Q expects the other object to be an instance of Q, and it raises a TypeError if it isn't. The Exists class does not have a `__rand__` method that could handle the reverse operation, which would make the operations commutative. The relevant code spans that need to be inspected and potentially modified are within the Q class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, especially the `__and__` and `_combine` methods, and possibly the Combinable class if it's involved in the logic of combining expressions. No code spans in the Exists class seem directly responsible for this issue, but the Exists class's interaction with the Q class through the `__and__` method is the core of the problem. It is crucial to ensure that the `_combine` method correctly handles instances of both Q and Exists, or that a `__rand__` method is implemented for the Exists class to manage commutative operations correctly. This would ensure that `Q() & Exists(...)` and `Exists(...) & Q()` both function as expected without raising a TypeError.",
