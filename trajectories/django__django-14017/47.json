Specifically, Exists(...) & Q(...) works as expected, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. This discrepancy points towards a potential missing implementation of the __rand__ method in the Q class.\n\nReviewing the provided code spans, the Q class does not currently implement the __rand__ method, which is crucial for correctly handling the reverse operation of '&' when an Exists object is on the left and a Q object is on the right. This omission likely causes the TypeError when attempting Q(...) & Exists(...).\n\nTo resolve this issue, the Q class should be updated to include the __rand__ method. This method should handle the scenario where the other object is an instance of Exists and should perform the combination appropriately, similar to how the __and__ method currently works. This addition will ensure that the '&' operation is commutative for Q and Exists objects.\n\nGiven the current search results, the relevant code spans are those within the Q class definition in django/db/models/query_utils.py, as they relate directly to the functionality of combining Q objects with other objects using '&'. Specifically, the __and__ method and the _combine method are critical for understanding and resolving this issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans include the entire Q class definition to ensure a thorough understanding of how to implement the required __rand__ method correctly.",

Specifically, Q() & Exists(...) raises a TypeError, while Exists(...) & Q() works as expected. The error occurs because the Q class, when combined with a non-Q object, raises a TypeError in the _combine method. The suggested solution implies that the Exists class should implement the __rand__ method to handle the reverse combination scenario correctly.\n\nIn the file context, we see the implementation of the Q class and its various methods like __and__, __or__, and _combine, where the TypeError occurs. The file 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' has the relevant code spans for Q.\n\nIn the new search results, the file 'django/db/models/expressions.py' contains the implementation of the Combinable class, which includes the __rand__ method. Implementing this method in the Exists class might solve the issue by allowing Exists objects to handle the reverse combination scenario. There are also definitions for the Exists and Subquery classes, which hint at potential places to add the missing __rand__ method.\n\nThus, identifying relevant code spans involves sections related to Q, Combinable, Exists, and Subquery.",
