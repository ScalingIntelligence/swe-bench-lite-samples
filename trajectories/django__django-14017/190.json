Specifically, the error occurs when trying to do 'Q() & Exists(...)', while 'Exists(...) & Q()' works without issues. This indicates a potential issue with the implementation of the __and__ method or the missing __rand__ method in the Q class or the Exists class.\n\n1. In the analyzed search results, I found the relevant code span 'Q.__and__' which contains the definition of the __and__ method for the Q class. This method attempts to combine two Q objects using the AND operator, which might be the source of the issue.\n\n2. Additionally, in the 'expressions.py' file, under the 'Combinable' class, there is a definition for the __and__ method, and a missing __rand__ method. This further supports the hypothesis that the missing __rand__ method might be causing the TypeError, as it suggests that there could be a need for defining a reverse operation to handle the case where Exists precedes Q.\n\n3. The Exists class extends from the Subquery class and doesn't override the __and__ or __rand__ methods, suggesting that the issue might indeed be related to how these methods are defined in their parent classes, especially considering the error is raised when combining an Exists object with any other object via the '&' operator.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are strong indications that the relevant code spans are within the definitions of the __and__ and the potentially missing __rand__ methods. Therefore, for this search task, I will identify the 'Q.__and__' span from 'query_utils.py' and the 'Combinable.__and__' and 'Combinable.__rand__' spans from 'expressions.py' as relevant.",

The issue described involves the missing definition of `__rand__` in the context of the `Q` class and `Exists` class interaction. The `Combinable` class does have a `__rand__` method, but it raises a `NotImplementedError`. However, the primary issue seems to be that `Q() & Exists(Product.objects.all())` is raising a `TypeError` due to the mismatch in types that the `__and__` method is handling. The `__and__` method in the `Q` class expects another `Q` object, which isn't the case when `Exists` object is passed. This suggests that either the `Q` class or the `Exists` class might need additional handling for such cases. Since the specific issue involves the `Q` class and its interaction with `Exists`, the relevant code is present in the file context. However, the solution might involve modifying how `Q` handles the combination with non-`Q` objects. I can mark this as complete since the relevant code is identified, but a deeper dive into the interaction between `Q` and `Exists` might be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
