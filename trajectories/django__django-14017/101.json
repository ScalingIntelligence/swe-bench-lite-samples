This suggests an asymmetry in how these objects interact with the & operator.\n\nBy examining the search results, we can pinpoint the relevant code spans where this interaction occurs. The relevant spans include:\n1. `Q.__and__` in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` which defines how the & operator works for Q objects.\n2. `Exists` in `django/db/models/expressions.py` which includes the Exists class definition.\n3. `Combinable.__and__` and `Combinable.__rand__`, also in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, which define how the & operator works for Combinable objects (a base class for Exists).\n\nThe issue might arise because Exists does not have an explicit definition for `__rand__`, which could be why the operation is commutative in one order but not the other. This suggests that either an explicit `__rand__` method for Exists or a modification in the handling of the & operator in Q or Exists might resolve the issue.",
