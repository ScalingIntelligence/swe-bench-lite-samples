By analyzing the provided search results, I focused on the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py` files. In `query_utils.py`, the Q class defines the __and__ method but does not define __rand__. The `expressions.py` file includes the Combinable class with __and__ and __rand__ methods but does not directly deal with Q and Exists interaction. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the Q class's handling of the & operator and the missing __rand__ method, which are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue.",

Specifically, 'Q() & Exists(...)' raises a TypeError while 'Exists(...) & Q()' works. The problem suggests that there might be a missing definition for the __rand__ method in the relevant classes.\n\nThe current file context already identifies several relevant spans in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', which include the definition of the Q class and its __and__ method. This method calls the _combine method, which checks if 'other' is an instance of Q and raises a TypeError if it is not.\n\nIn the new search results, there are several potentially relevant code spans in 'django/db/models/expressions.py'. Most notably, the Combinable class includes a __rand__ method, which raises a NotImplementedError. This suggests that this method might need to be implemented or modified to handle the combination of Q objects with Exists expressions.\n\nThe Exists class is also found in 'django/db/models/expressions.py', which is an extension of Subquery. This class does not explicitly define __and__ or __rand__ methods, so it relies on the methods defined in its parent classes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' are most relevant to addressing the reported issue. Specifically, the __rand__ method in the Combinable class and the Exists class definition need to be reviewed or possibly modified to ensure that the combination of Q and Exists objects is handled correctly in both directions of the '&' operation.",
