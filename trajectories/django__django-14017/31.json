Specifically, the issue occurs when Q() & Exists(...) is invoked but not when Exists(...) & Q() is used. The error indicates that the & operator is not commutative in this context and suggests a missing definition of __rand__ somewhere.\n\nThe relevant code spans provided in the current context include definitions of the Q class and its methods such as __and__, __or__, and __invert__. These methods handle the combination of Q objects with AND, OR, and NOT connectors. The Exists class is also present, which inherits from Subquery and defines methods like __init__, __invert__, and as_sql. The Exists class correctly initializes and inverts itself but doesn't handle combination operations with other objects like Q.\n\nThe new search results introduce the Combinable class which includes a definition for __rand__. This method is meant to handle bitwise AND operations, but it raises a NotImplementedError suggesting that specific methods should be used (bitand() and bitor()). This provides a clue that the issue might be related to missing overloading methods for bitwise operations in the Exists class.\n\nBased on the analysis of both the current context and the new search results, the files django/db/models/query_utils.py and django/db/models/expressions.py contain the relevant code spans. Specifically, the __and__ method in the Q class and the Combinable class's __rand__ method in expressions.py are identified as relevant because they directly relate to the reported issue of the non-commutative behavior of the '&' operator. Implementing or modifying the __rand__ and __and__ methods (possibly in the Exists class) might resolve the issue.",
