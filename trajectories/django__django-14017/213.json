The error suggests that the Exists object is not being recognized in the context where it is combined with a Q object using the '&' operator. This might be due to a missing definition for the __rand__ method in the relevant classes, which would handle the combination if the Exists object is on the left side of the '&' operator. Since the file context is empty, we need to locate the relevant parts of the codebase. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the Q and Exists classes in the Django codebase is a good starting point.",

The TypeError occurs specifically when Q() is on the left side and Exists(...) is on the right. This suggests an issue with the implementation of the __and__ method in the Q class or related classes. Upon reviewing the provided search results, I identified code spans in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' related to the Q class, particularly the __and__ method. Additionally, the existence of the Combinable class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' might also be relevant as it includes the __and__ and __rand__ methods, which could influence the behavior of the 'and' operator between Q and Exists. The Exists class also defines the __init__ and __invert__ methods, but direct handling of the 'and' operator is not explicitly seen.
