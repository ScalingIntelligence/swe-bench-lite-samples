The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the '__and__' method of the Q class, and it seems there might be a missing definition for '__rand__' in the Combinable class, which is the base class for Q objects.\n\nReviewing the search results, there is an import statement for Q from django.db.models import query_utils, which is relevant as the issue is related to Q objects. The 'Combinable' class definition is also present and contains a '__rand__' method. This method isn't actually implemented for the 'and' operation but raises a 'NotImplementedError', indicating that the logic for bitwise operations is not directly applicable to this issue.\n\nGiven the relevance of the Q import and the existence of the '__rand__' method in the Combinable class, these are the key portions of the code that might be relevant to addressing the reported issue, potentially by implementing missing logic in the '__rand__' method to handle the 'and' operation correctly between a Q object and an Exists object.",

Additionally, the _combine method in the Q class in query_utils.py is central to the combination process but fails to account for types other than Q, thereby raising a TypeError when encountering an Exists object on the right side of the & operator. To address this issue, we should start by implementing or updating the __rand__ method in relevant classes like Combinable, Exists, or other affected classes, ensuring they properly handle the combination with Q objects.
