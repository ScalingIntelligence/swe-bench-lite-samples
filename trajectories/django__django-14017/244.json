The relevant code spans include the definition of methods like __and__, __or__, and _combine in classes Q, Combinable, and Exists. Focusing on these methods in the query_utils.py and expressions.py files should be the starting point to understand why the expected commutative behavior isn't upheld.",

The issue might be related to the absence of a __rand__ method in the Q class, which would allow it to handle being on the right-hand side of an & operation if the left-hand side is not a Q object.
