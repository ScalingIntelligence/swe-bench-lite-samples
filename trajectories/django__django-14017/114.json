However, the `__rand__` method for the `Combinable` class raises a `NotImplementedError`, which seems to be the problem as it doesn't provide the desired functionality when an `Exists` object is combined with a `Q` object. Furthermore, the class `Q` does not have a defined `__rand__` method that could be used to handle such a scenario.
