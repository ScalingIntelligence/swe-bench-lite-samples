The TypeError occurs because the Exists object is not recognized as a valid operand for the '&' operation when combined with a Q object first. This suggests a missing or incomplete implementation of the __rand__ method in the Q class, which would handle the reverse combination of these objects. The search results reveal the relevant portions of the Q class and the Exists class in the Django models. The Q class includes the __and__ method, which raises the TypeError if the other object is not an instance of Q. The Exists class, which inherits from Subquery, does not override the __and__ or __rand__ methods. To address the issue, it's necessary to ensure that Exists objects are recognized and properly combined with Q objects in both orders by implementing or correcting the __rand__ method in the Q class.",

According to the error trace, the TypeError is raised because the other operand in the _combine method is not an instance of Q. This suggests that the method may not be handling non-Q instances gracefully, or that there's a missing definition of __rand__ for the Q class. Given the search results, we can identify relevant code spanning in both query_utils.py and expressions.py. Specifically, the Q class in query_utils.py is the primary suspect for the issue, as the error originates from its _combine method. Also, expressions.py contains the Exists class, which is involved in the operation that fails. Moreover, the existence of the Combinable class in expressions.py raises a NotImplementedError for __rand__, suggesting that it might need customization to handle the Exists object properly. Additionally, the SearchQueryCombinable class in contrib/postgres/search.py implements __rand__, indicating a potential solution for extending the functionality for handling Exists and other types. As such, the provided code spans are relevant to addressing the issue.",

The error indicates that Q().__and__() expects 'other' to be an instance of Q, but it receives an instance of Exists. This suggests that a commutative nature is expected but isn't correctly implemented. It's notable that the Exists class does not override the __and__ method, but Q does. The provided search results confirm the existence of the __rand__ method in the Combinable class but also show that Exists does not implement its own version of this method. This means that when Exists tries to combine with Q using the & operator, it relies on the default implementation in Q, leading to the TypeError. To resolve the issue, Exists should define a __rand__ method that can handle combining with Q, ensuring commutative behavior. The search results also confirm the inherited methods from Combinable that could be causing the issue. Since Q and Exists inherit from different classes with different implementations of logical operations, the issue seems to stem from a missing definition or incorrect handling of the '__rand__' method in the Exists class specifically for the & operator.",
