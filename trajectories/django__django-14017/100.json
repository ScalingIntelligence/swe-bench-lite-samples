Upon reviewing the provided search results, it is clear that the `__and__` method directly calls the `_combine` method without checking if the `other` object is an instance of `Q`. This could be causing the TypeError when an Exists object (which is not a `Q` object) is passed. The solution could involve implementing a `__rand__` method in the `Q` class, which would handle the reverse operation when the 'other' object is not a `Q` object but an Exists object. This would ensure the operation is commutative, as the `&` operator should ideally work with both `Q & Exists` and `Exists & Q`.
