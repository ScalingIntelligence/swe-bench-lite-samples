This suggests that the Q object's implementation of the __and__ method is not compatible with non-Q objects, as evidenced by the TypeError thrown when the Exists object is on the right-hand side of the '&' operator. The solution to this issue may involve defining the __rand__ method in the Q class to handle the reverse combination operation. In terms of identifying relevant code spans, focus should be on the Q class within django/db/models/query_utils.py to find where the __and__ and possibly the __rand__ methods are defined. Additionally, examining the Exists class in django/db/models/expressions.py will provide context on how it interacts with the Q class. Furthermore, given the nature of the issue, reviewing the Combinable class and its methods in the same file might reveal additional insights or potential areas for improvement.",
