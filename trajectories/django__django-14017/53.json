Currently, Exists(...) objects do not have a specific __rand__ method defined to handle being the right operand of an AND operation with Q. To resolve this, it's necessary to define a __rand__ method for the Exists class or modify the Q class to handle the combination of Q and Exists objects more gracefully, ensuring that the operation is commutative. From the search results, it's clear that the Q class and the Exists class are located in different files, with the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and the Exists class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py'.

The provided file context and search results show definitions for __and__ and __or__ methods in the Q class, but no explicit __rand__ method.
