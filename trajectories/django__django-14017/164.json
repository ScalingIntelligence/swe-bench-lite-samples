Specifically, when attempting to combine `Q` and `Exists` objects using the `&` operator, a `TypeError` is raised if the order is `Q() & Exists()`, whereas `Exists() & Q()` works correctly. This suggests that the `__and__` method of the `Q` class does not handle `Exists` objects properly. To resolve this, we need to locate the `__and__` method in the `Q` class and ensure it properly handles `Exists` objects. Additionally, it's mentioned that a missing `__rand__` method might be the cause. Therefore, we should also look for the definition of `__rand__` in the relevant files.",

The provided file context and search results highlight the relevant parts of the codebase, including the definition of Q and Exists. Notably, Exists inherits from Subquery, which does not define any special methods for bitwise operations like __and__ or __rand__. The search results also show the Combinable class, which does define __rand__, but it throws a NotImplementedError. The SearchQueryCombinable class, however, does override __rand__ to combine using the BITAND operator, which might be the solution missing for Q. The task is to incorporate or associate Q with such a method to handle the Exists object correctly when using the & operator. Therefore, the relevant code spans would be Q and the Combinable or SearchQueryCombinable classes and their methods that handle bitwise operations to suggest where the fix could be made.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` works. The error suggests a missing definition for `__rand__` in the `Q` class or related classes. \n\nExamining the provided code, we see implementations of `Q.__and__`, but no `Q.__rand__`. The `Exists` class is a subclass of `Subquery`, which in turn inherits from `Expression`, and `Expression` mixes in `Combinable`. The `Combinable` class already has a `__rand__` method that raises `NotImplementedError`. However, the `SearchQueryCombinable` class, which is unrelated to this issue directly, does provide a `__rand__` method. \n\nGiven these observations, it appears that the solution might involve implementing a `__rand__` method for the `Q` class or modifying the `Combinable` class to handle the `&` operation between `Q` and `Exists` objects more gracefully. The relevant code spans identified in the search results confirm the absence of `__rand__` in the expected classes and align with the reported issue.
