Specifically, the error occurs when the order is Q() & Exists(...), whereas Exists(...) & Q() works correctly. The issue suggests that there might be a missing definition for the __rand__ method, which would allow the Exists object to handle the '&' operation when used on the right-hand side. The search results include the implementation of the Q class, specifically focusing on the __and__ method. This method is central to the issue since it is where the TypeError is being raised. By examining the provided code span for the __and__ method, we can see that it attempts to combine the current Q object with another object using the AND connector but raises a TypeError if the other object is not an instance of Q. This confirms the need for an __rand__ method in the Exists class or the Q class to handle such combinations correctly, ensuring that the '&' operator is commutative between Q and Exists objects.",
