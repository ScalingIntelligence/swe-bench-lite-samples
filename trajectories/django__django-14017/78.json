This suggests an asymmetric behavior due to potentially missing operator definitions or incorrect handling in the code. The file_context provides insights into the 'Q' class and its '__and__' method, which is central to the issue. Additionally, it appears in the Combinable class, suggesting possible interaction points. Analyzing new search results, the Combinable class has '__rand__' method raising 'NotImplementedError', which implies that this might be the missing link in allowing the 'Exists' object to handle being on the right side of the '&' operation. This aligns with the suggestion that the 'Q-Exists' pair should be commutative, but currently, it isn't. To resolve this, it appears necessary to implement or modify the '__rand__' method in a manner that allows for correct operation with 'Q() & Exists(...)'.",

When Exists(...) & Q(...) is used, it works as expected, but when Q(...) & Exists(...) is used, it raises a TypeError. The error occurs because the Q class's __and__ method expects the other operand to be an instance of Q, and when it encounters an Exists object, it raises a TypeError. This suggests a missing implementation of the __rand__ method in the Exists or Combinable class. The relevant code spans in the search results include the definition of the Q class, its __init__, _combine, and __and__ methods, as well as the Combinable class with its __rand__ method. These code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue by ensuring that the & operator can handle Exists objects correctly.
