Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` does not. This suggests a possible missing implementation or handling of the `__rand__` method in the `Q` class, which is responsible for the reverse operation of `&`. The relevant code spans to address this issue are primarily in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file, focusing on the `Q` class and its methods, especially `__and__` and `_combine`. These methods are crucial for combining `Q` objects with other objects, including `Exists`, and need to be reviewed to ensure proper handling of different object types and the commutative property of the `&` operator. The search results do not directly include the missing `__rand__` implementation, but analyzing and potentially modifying the existing methods in the `Q` class is necessary to address the issue.",
