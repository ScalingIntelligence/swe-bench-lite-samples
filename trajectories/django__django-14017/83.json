The error occurs specifically when the Exists object is placed on the right side of the 'AND' operation, indicating that the operation is not commutative as expected. The issue suggests that a missing definition of the __rand__ method might be the cause. To address this, it's crucial to identify the code spans that deal with the Q class and its operations, particularly the __and__ method and the Exists class. Reviewing the search results, the relevant code spans include: 1. The Q class definition and its methods (__and__, __or__, __init__, __invert__). 2. The Combinable class and its __and__ method, which raises a NotImplementedError for bitwise operations. 3. The Exists class, which inherits from Subquery and is used to check for existence in a subquery. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how Q objects and Exists objects interact and could potentially be where the issue arises. Additional code that manages the operations, such as the QuerySet class and its methods handling query combination, might also be relevant for implementing any required changes to ensure the 'AND' operation works as expected. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans should be sufficient to address the issue by either correcting the existing methods or adding the missing __rand__ method to the Q class.",
