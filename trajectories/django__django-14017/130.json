These definitions are crucial as they define how `Q` objects are combined.\n\nNew search results include additional code spans from `django/db/models/expressions.py`. A key inclusion here is the `Combinable` class and its method `__rand__`. The `Exists` class, which is a subclass of `Subquery`, is also present in the search results.\n\nGiven this, the most relevant code spans are those that relate to `Combinable` and `Exists` classes because the error occurs when combining `Q` objects with `Exists` objects using `&`. However, the current implementation of `__rand__` in the `Combinable` class raises `NotImplementedError`, which might be contributing to the reported error. The issue indicated a need for a missing definition of `__rand__`, which is now evident in the search results.\n\nThis information is significant as it shows the current handling of bitwise AND with `Combinable` objects and how `Exists` objects fit into this structure.

Additionally, the Exists class, which is a subclass of Subquery, does not show any direct interaction with the Q class in terms of logical operations. Given the absence of __rand__ and the way the Exists class is implemented, the issue could be rooted in how the Q class expects to interact with other objects, which specifically does not include the Exists class directly. This suggests that the logic might need to be adjusted within the Q class's __and__ method to handle Exists objects or possibly implement __rand__ if such a method does not already exist.",

The 'Q' class has an '__and__' method but lacks '__rand__', which is likely the root cause of the issue. Similarly, the 'Combinable' class in 'expressions.py' has a '__rand__' method that raises NotImplementedError, which also points to the missing implementation for 'Exists' or 'Q' classes to handle the reverse bitwise operation.
