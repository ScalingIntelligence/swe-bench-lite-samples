The provided code spans from 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' include the Q class definition, its __init__ method, the _combine method, and the __and__ method. The error occurs when the _combine method is called from the __and__ method, specifically because the method expects 'other' to be an instance of Q, which is not the case with Exists objects. This strongly suggests that the relevant code spans are those that define the Q class's combination logic, particularly the '_combine' and '__and__' methods. Additionally, while not directly mentioned in the issue, considering the commutative nature of the operators as described in the issue, it might be beneficial to also check for the existence of the __rand__ method, which is not implemented in the provided code spans.

The issue describes a TypeError when combining a `Q` object with an `Exists` object, which aligns with the current implementation not handling non-Q objects and missing a `__rand__` method. The context suggests that adding a `__rand__` method to the `Q` class could resolve this issue. The other files and classes provided (e.g., `Combinable`, `Window`, and `SearchQueryCombinable`) demonstrate the expectation or requirement for a `__rand__` method in similar contexts to handle bitwise operations and combined expressions. Therefore, it appears that the relevant section of the codebase for addressing this issue has been identified, even if the exact fix (adding `__rand__` to `Q`) is not yet implemented.",
