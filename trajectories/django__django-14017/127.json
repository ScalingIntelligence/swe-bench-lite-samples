The issue suggests that the '&' operator should be commutative, but it raises a TypeError in one order. This indicates a potential problem with how the '__and__' method in the Q class handles the Exists object. The provided code spans include the definition of the Q class and its '__and__' method. The '__and__' method attempts to combine the Q object with another object using the AND connector, but it does not handle non-Q objects gracefully, leading to the TypeError.

This suggests that the __and__ method in the Q class might not properly handle the Exists object. The current context shows the definition of __and__ in the Q class, but no definition for __rand__ which is likely necessary to handle the reverse order of operations. The new search results include the Combinable class from expressions.py which has a __rand__ method that raises a NotImplementedError. This indicates that the Combinable class, which Exists might inherit from, does not support the reverse bitwise AND operation. The SearchQueryCombinable class in search.py also has a __rand__ method, suggesting that some classes within Django are equipped to handle such operations. However, the Exists class directly inherits from Combinable without overriding __rand__. Since the issue likely arises from the missing __rand__ method handling, identifying the Combinable class and possibly the Exists class within Django's codebase is crucial to address the issue effectively. This approach should guide the solution to define or override the __rand__ method in a way that it can handle the Exists object properly when it's the first operand in an AND operation.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, whereas `Exists(...) & Q()` works. The issue suggests that a missing definition of `__rand__` might be the cause.\n\nReviewing the current context, we see definitions for `Q` and `Combinable`, but the `__rand__` method in `Combinable` raises a `NotImplementedError`. The new search results provide additional context on `Exists` and its methods, but do not directly address the `__rand__` method for `Q` or `Exists`. However, the `__rand__` method in `SearchQueryCombinable` might provide a clue as to how to implement the missing functionality.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `__rand__` method (right-side operator method) is implemented in the `Q` class or potentially in the `Exists` class if it inherits from a class (like `Combinable`) that does not handle this method correctly.\n\nPrior research on similar issues suggests that implementing `__rand__` can resolve the issue by allowing `Q` objects to handle operations when they are on the right side of an operation involving other types, like `Exists`. Based on the findings, it is recommended to implement or override the `__rand__` method in classes where logic operations need to be commutative.",
