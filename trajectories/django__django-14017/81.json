This missing functionality is evident from the provided minimal example where `Exists(...) & Q()` works, but `Q() & Exists(...)` does not. The search results include the relevant code within the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file, specifically the `Q` class definition. The key methods identified as relevant are `Q.__and__` and `Q._combine`. The `Q.__and__` method currently only handles the `&` operator when `Q` is on the left side. To address the issue, it seems necessary to add support for the reverse operation (i.e., when `Exists` is on the left and `Q` is on the right). This would likely involve defining a `__rand__` method or extending the existing `__and__` method to accommodate this scenario more gracefully. The code spans associated with `Q.__and__` and `Q._combine` are the most relevant given the issue description.",
