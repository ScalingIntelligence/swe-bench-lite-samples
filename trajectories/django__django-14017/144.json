The reverse order (Exists(...) & Q()) works correctly. The error indicates that the '__and__' method in the Q class expects the 'other' operand to be an instance of Q, and raises a TypeError if it isn't. This suggests that the Exists class does not have a '__rand__' method defined, which would allow it to handle being the right operand in an '&' operation with a Q object.\n\nFrom the provided code, we can see that the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' has the '__and__' method, but there is no '__rand__' method in the Q class. This is likely why the operation fails when the Q object is on the left. The Exists class, defined in 'django/db/models/expressions.py', inherits from Subquery and does not override any methods related to the '&' operation. The Combinable class, which is a superclass of Exists, raises a NotImplementedError for the '__rand__' method, indicating it hasn't been implemented.\n\nTo address the issue, it seems necessary to implement a '__rand__' method in either the Q class or the Exists class, or both, to handle cases where Exists is the right operand and Q is the left operand in an '&' operation. This would allow the operation to be commutative as expected. The provided search results do not add any new information but confirm the absence of a '__rand__' method in relevant classes.",
