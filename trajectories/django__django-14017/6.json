The issue suggests that the `&` operator should be commutative between `Q` and `Exists` objects, but currently, calling `Q() & Exists(...)` raises an error because `Q.__and__` expects another `Q` object. However, `Exists` is not a `Q` object, leading to the error. The key to resolving this issue likely involves implementing the missing `__rand__` method in the appropriate class to handle the reverse combination. From the search results, we see that both `Q` and `Exists` classes are in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py`, respectively. The `Combinable` class in `expressions.py` has a `__rand__` method, but it raises a `NotImplementedError`. This suggests that the implementation might need to handle `Exists` objects specifically to make `Q() & Exists(...)` work correctly. Additionally, the `SearchQueryCombinable` class in `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` also has a `__rand__` method, which could serve as a reference for how to implement such a method for non-commutative bitwise operations. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue include `Q.__and__`, `Combinable.__rand__`, and potentially `SearchQueryCombinable.__rand__`.",
