Specifically, it highlights that Exists(...) & Q(...) works, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. The issue suggests that defining __rand__ might resolve the problem. Upon reviewing the search results, it's clear that there's a specific place in the Django codebase where such a definition might be needed or is already partially implemented but not adequately. In django/db/models/expressions.py, there's a class Combinable with methods __and__ and __rand__. The __rand__ method currently raises a NotImplementedError, which directly relates to the reported issue. This suggests that implementing or modifying the __rand__ method in this class could be the solution. Additionally, in django/contrib/postgres/search.py, there's a class SearchQueryCombinable that already implements __rand__ without raising any errors, which is notable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are found in the Combinable class within django/db/models/expressions.py and the __rand__ method within the SearchQueryCombinable class in django/contrib/postgres/search.py.",

The key to resolving this is to ensure that the __rand__ method for Q is defined correctly, allowing commutative operations. The provided search results show relevant code spans across multiple files. The 'django/db/models/expressions.py' file contains the Combinable class, which raises a NotImplementedError for the __rand__ method. This is likely where the issue lies, as it indicates that the reverse bitwise & operation is not implemented, causing the TypeError. Additionally, the 'django/contrib/postgres/search.py' file contains the SearchQueryCombinable class, which has a __rand__ method implementation, providing an example of a proper implementation that could guide fixing the issue in ComboComparable. The 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' file provides the Q class, where the __init__ method is observed, potentially providing context for needed modifications to ensure the & operation is commutative. Therefore, these search results acknowledge the required changes, set up a place for putting in the proper implementation, and give important information regarding the contexts to determine if the search task is complete and the reported is covered thoroughly addressing the TypeError raised in the context of Q objects bitwise operations.",

The relevant code should include the definition or implementation of the __rand__ method within the Q class in the django/db/models/query_utils.py file and in the Exists class in django/db/models/expressions.py. Upon examining the file context, it appears that the Q class lacks the necessary definition of the __rand__ method to handle the Exists object as a valid left-hand operand for the AND operation.
