The issue is that `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError. This suggests a missing definition of `__rand__` in the `Q` class, which would handle the reverse-and operation. To address this, I need to check the `Q` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` for the presence of `__rand__` and ensure that the `Exists` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` can interact correctly with `Q`. Based on the search results, the `Q` class lacks the `__rand__` method, which is likely causing the TypeError. I will identify the relevant code spans in the `Q` and `Exists` classes for further review.",

Specifically, Exists(...) & Q(...) works as expected, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. The traceback indicates that the TypeError occurs in the __and__ method of the Q class when it attempts to combine with an Exists object. This suggests that the Exists object is not being treated as a valid operand for the & operator in this context.\n\nThe current file context includes relevant code spans from `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py`. These spans include the definitions of the Q class and its methods (__and__, __or__, __init__, __invert__, and resolve_expression), as well as the Exists class and its methods (__init__, __invert__, and as_sql).\n\nThe new search results provide additional context in the form of the Combinable class from `django/db/models/expressions.py` and the SearchQueryCombinable class from `django/contrib/postgres/search.py`. Notably, the Combinable class includes a __rand__ method, which is not implemented for the Exists class. This could be the missing piece that allows Q(...) & Exists(...) to work correctly by defining how an Exists object should be combined with a Q object when the Exists object is on the right-hand side of the & operator.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans that need to be identified are those that pertain to the combination of Q and Exists objects, particularly the __rand__ method of the Combinable class, which might need to be implemented or extended for the Exists class to ensure proper commutativity of the & operator.",
