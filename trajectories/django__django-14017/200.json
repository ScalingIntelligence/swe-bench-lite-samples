The error occurs specifically when trying to combine Q() & Exists(), but not when combining Exists() & Q(). This suggests a possible inconsistency or missing implementation in the __rand__ method within the Q class. Given the stack trace and the nature of the error, it's important to focus on the Q class and its interaction with Exists objects. The search should be targeted at the query_utils.py file where the Q class is defined, and potentially related methods in the expressions.py file where the Exists class resides. Additional checks should be made in the query.py file as it handles the query logic, which might also relate to this issue.",

Specifically, Q() & Exists() raises a TypeError, while Exists() & Q() works correctly. The issue suggests that there might be a missing definition for __rand__ in the Exists class.\n\nReviewing the provided code, we can see that the `Combinable` class, from which `Exists` inherits, does have a definition for `__rand__`, but it raises a `NotImplementedError`. This would explain the TypeError encountered. Additionally, the `SearchQueryCombinable` class in the `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` file does implement `__rand__` but it is not related to `Exists` directly.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the core issue lies in the `Combinable` class's `__rand__` method. To fix the issue, one would need to either implement a proper `__rand__` method for the `Exists` class or ensure that the `Q` class handles the combination with `Exists` objects more gracefully. For now, the relevant code spans identified are the `Combinable` class and `SearchQueryCombinable` class definitions.",

This indicates a potential issue with the `__and__` method in the `Q` class or the lack of a `__rand__` method in the `Exists` class. From the provided `file_context`, it's evident that `Q.__and__` is defined to combine `Q` objects but does not handle `Exists` objects properly, raising a `TypeError`. The search results also confirm the existence of `Q.__and__` and `Combinable.__rand__`, which is relevant as `Q` inherits from `Combinable`. The existence of `SearchQueryCombinable.__rand__` in `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` suggests that similar functionality might be needed for `Exists`. The analysis of these details points to a need for implementing a `__rand__` method in the `Exists` class or ensuring that `Q.__and__` can handle `Exists` objects correctly.",

The issue reported involves the TypeError raised when using Q() & Exists(...). The context shows that Q inherits directly from tree.Node and does not explicitly override the __rand__ method which could be necessary to handle bitwise operations with Exists objects seamlessly. However, it indicates a potential need for Q to implement __rand__ or another related method to address the commutative property required in the issue. The Combinable class, which Q does not directly inherit from, has an __rand__ method, but it raises a NotImplementedError, suggesting that specific subclasses like Q need to override this for desired behavior. The Exists class is also provided, indicating its integration and usage patterns in bitwise operations. Based on this analysis, while the provided file context identifies potential areas (like Q inheriting from tree.Node and not overriding __rand__) and related classes (Combinable with __rand__ that needs overriding in Q), it does not directly include an overridden __rand__ in the Q class, leaving the issue potentially unresolved within the scope of the given context.",
