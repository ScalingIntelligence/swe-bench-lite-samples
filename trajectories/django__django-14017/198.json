The specific problem is that while 'Exists(...) & Q(...)' works, 'Q(...) & Exists(...)' raises a TypeError. To address this issue, I need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the logical operations involving Q and Exists objects, particularly focusing on the methods '__and__' and '_combine' of the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py'. I also need to check if there's any missing definition of '__rand__' method, which could ensure the commutativity of the '&' operator with Q and Exists objects. From the search results, the relevant code spans are identified: \n1. The '__and__' method within the Q class, which is responsible for handling the '&' operator between Q objects. \n2. The '_combine' method within the Q class, which is called by '__and__' to combine two Q objects and raises a TypeError if the other object is not an instance of Q. \n3. The 'FilteredRelation' class and its initialization which uses Q objects. \n\n However, the search results did not contain the '__rand__' method implementation for the Q class, which might be required to handle the commutativity issue. Additionally, the Combinable class's '__or__' method provides an implementation for handling 'Q(self) | Q(other)', which might need to be extended or adjusted based on the requirements. \n\n Since the '__rand__' method is not found, and considering the importance of ensuring commutativity, more in-depth search is recommended to find any potential missing implementation for '__rand__'. However, based on the current search results, the identified spans are likely relevant to the reported issue.",

This discrepancy is why a TypeError is raised. The __and__ method should ideally handle this case to maintain the commutative property of the & operator for Q and Exists combinations. The relevant code spans to address this issue are found in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', specifically the 'Q._combine', 'Q.__and__', and potentially 'Q.__rand__' methods. Additionally, in 'django/db/models/expressions.py', the 'Combinable' class and its methods that handle bitwise operations are also pertinent, particularly '__and__', 'bitand', and 'bitor'. These sections of code need to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the & operator correctly handles combinations with Exists objects and other types that may be logically combined with Q objects.",
