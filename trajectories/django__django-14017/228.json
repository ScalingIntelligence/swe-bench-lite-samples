This suggests a potential issue with the definition or handling of the __and__ method in the Q class or its combination logic. To address this, we should focus our search on the Q class in the query_utils module and the Exists class in the expressions module, as they are directly involved in handling these operations. Additionally, examining the QuerySet class in the query module might provide insight into how these objects are combined.",

The issue specifically points out that Q() & Exists(...) raises a TypeError while Exists(...) & Q() does not. This suggests a potential missing implementation of __rand__ for the Q class, meaning it cannot handle the reverse operation of the & operator with an Exists object. To address this, we need to identify code spans related to the Q class, the Exists class, and the & operator in the codebase.\n\nExamining the code spans provided in the search results, we find multiple relevant sections. In django/db/models/query_utils.py, there are spans for the Q class, including its __and__ method and the _combine method. These methods are critical for understanding how the combination of Q objects works and might be where the TypeError arises due to the lack of handling Exists objects. Additionally, there is a span in django/db/models/expressions.py for the Combinable class's __and__ method, which indicates how Django attempts to handle the & operator for combining expressions. This includes a conditional check for 'conditional' attributes that might relate to the issue with Q and Exists objects.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans identified are from the Q and Combinable classes, specifically focusing on the __and__ and _combine methods. Further investigation and possibly adding a __rand__ method to the Q class might resolve the issue reported.",

Specifically, the Q class in the query_utils module is where the combination logic involving Q objects and Exists expressions is defined. The _combine method in the Q class raises a TypeError if the other object is not an instance of Q, which is exactly the scenario described in the issue. Additionally, the Exists class in the expressions module is shown, though it does not directly handle the combining logic but rather uses the logic defined in the Q class. The provided context adequately addresses the issue by identifying where the potential problem lies. There is no missing __rand__ definition explicitly mentioned, but the existing code suggests that the __and__ method in the Q class might need further refinement to handle Exists objects more gracefully, potentially by implementing a check that could convert Exists objects to Q objects in such combinations.",
