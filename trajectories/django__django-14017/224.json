Specifically, the error occurs when trying to combine `Q()` and `Exists()` in a non-commutative manner: `Q() & Exists(...)` raises the TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` does not. The issue suggests that the missing definition of `__rand__` in the `Combinable` class might be the cause.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, I can see the definition of the `Combinable` class, which is relevant to the issue. Within this class, there are several methods for combining expressions, including `__and__`, `__or__`, and their reversed counterparts (`__rand__`, `__ror__`). Crucially, the `__rand__` method is defined but raises a `NotImplementedError`, which aligns with the expectation that this might be the source of the issue. This method should be implemented to handle the combination logic when `Exists()` is on the left and `Q()` is on the right within the `&` operation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the code spans relevant to addressing the issue would be those in the `Combinable` class, particularly the `__rand__` method.",

Analyzing the current context, it's evident that the Combinable class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' has a __rand__ method that raises a NotImplementedError. This confirms the suspicion about the missing method for reverse bitwise operations.\n\nLooking into the new search results, the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' includes methods like __and__, __or__, and __invert__, but does not override the __rand__ method to handle reverse bitwise operations. This lack of an overridden __rand__ method directly contributes to the TypeError encountered in the reported issue when Q() & Exists() is attempted.\n\nTo address this issue, it would be relevant to implement the __rand__ method in the Q class, ensuring that it can handle the Exists object correctly, similar to the __and__ method. The Exists class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' also does not override the __rand__ method, further supporting the need for such an implementation within the Q class.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans directly relevant to the issue would include the Q._combine method for defining bitwise operations and potentially adding a new __rand__ method in the Q class to maintain symmetry in bitwise operations.",
