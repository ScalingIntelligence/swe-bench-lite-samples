This suggests an asymmetry in how these operators handle combinations with Exists objects. The error message indicates that the TypeError arises because the Exists object is not recognized as a valid operand for the & operation. This could be due to missing definitions for commutative operations in the Exists class or in the Q class's handling of such combinations. To resolve this, we should focus on the Exists class and the Q class within Django's db models module, specifically looking into how they handle combination operations and whether additional definitions (like __rand__) are needed.",

Specifically, Q() & Exists(...) raises a TypeError, indicating that the __and__ method in Q is not handling Exists objects correctly. This suggests a potential issue with the implementation of the __rand__ method in the Exists class or related combinable classes, as Python's operator overloading typically requires both __and__ and __rand__ to ensure commutative behavior. The provided file context shows the implementation of Q and its __and__ method, which attempts to combine with another object but fails when encountering an Exists object. In the search results, the Combinable class is defined in 'django/db/models/expressions.py', which includes methods like __and__ and __rand__. The Exists class is also found here, suggesting that the issue could be related to how Exists handles operator combinations. The existence of __rand__ in Combinable is particularly relevant, as its presence or absence could explain the commutative issue described. Therefore, it appears that the missing or incorrect implementation of __rand__ in Exists or Combinable might be the root cause of the reported TypeError. The identified spans focus on these key areas.",
