According to the error trace, the operation Q() & Exists(...) raises a TypeError, while Exists(...) & Q() works as expected. This suggests a potential missing implementation or a bug in the handling of the '&' operator for these objects. Given the context provided, I will focus the search on the files related to Q objects, Exists expressions, and the relevant operator definitions in Django's QuerySet, Query, and QueryUtils modules. Specifically, I will look for any missing __rand__ method implementation or other related inconsistencies.",

Specifically, it mentions that Exists(...) & Q(...) works but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. This suggests an inconsistency in the handling of the 'and' operation between these objects.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it appears that the Q class defines methods for __and__ and __or__, which handle combining Q objects with an AND or OR operation, respectively. However, the Exists class, which is a subclass of Subquery, does not define methods for __and__ or __rand__ (right-handed 'and'), and so there may be an issue with the lack of a specific handling for Exists objects when they are on the right side of the 'and' operation with a Q object.\n\nGiven this, the relevant code spans would be:\n- Q class definition in django/db/models/query_utils.py to understand how 'and' operations are handled.\n- Exists class definition in django/db/models/expressions.py to identify if there's specific handling for 'and' operations.\n- Combinable class definition which includes __rand__ method that raises NotImplementedError, suggesting that it might be part of the issue causing the TypeError when the order of parameters for '&' are reversed.\n\nThese sections of code will help in understanding the current implementation and identifying where the logic falls short in accommodating the scenario described in the issue.",
