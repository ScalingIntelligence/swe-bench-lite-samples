Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, indicating that the operation isn't commutative as expected. This suggests a missing implementation of the `__rand__` method in the Q class or Exists class, which is responsible for handling the reverse operation of `&`. By examining the provided code spans, I focused on the `Q` class implementation in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, particularly the `__and__` method where the TypeError is encountered. The method attempts to combine two instances of the Q class but raises a TypeError if the other object is not an instance of Q. This aligns with the reported issue, confirming that the Exists object, which is not a Q object, causes the TypeError. Given the issue and the provided code, the next step should involve adding or checking for the `__rand__` method in both the Q and Exists classes to ensure commutative operations. This might involve implementing the `__rand__` method or adjusting the `_combine` method in the Q class to handle non-Q objects like Exists correctly.",
