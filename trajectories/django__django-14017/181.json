The issue suggests that there might be a missing definition of __rand__ somewhere, which would be necessary for the operation to be commutative. I will analyze the code spans related to the Q class and Exists class to determine if any missing methods or necessary modifications are present.\n\nIn [Q.__and__](#Q.__and__), it is evident that the __and__ method of the Q class does not handle the case when 'other' is an instance of Exists, leading to the TypeError. This aligns with the reported issue and indicates that the problem lies in the handling of the 'other' parameter within the __and__ method.\n\nAdditionally, I will examine the Combinable class which is found in django/db/models/expressions.py, specifically the [Combinable.__rand__](#Combinable.__rand__) method. The issue suggests that defining __rand__ could resolve the problem, making the operation commutative. However, the current implementation of __rand__ in Combinable class raises a NotImplementedError, confirming that this method does not support the required functionality.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are the ones related to the Q class's __and__ method and the Combinable class's __rand__ method, which need to be addressed to solve the reported issue.",

The error trace points to `django/db/models/query_utils.py` where the `__and__` method of the `Q` class tries to combine the objects. The issue suggests that a missing definition of `__rand__` could be the cause.\n\nIn the current file context, there is a relevant `__rand__` method in the `Combinable` class within `django/db/models/expressions.py`, which raises a `NotImplementedError`. However, the search results show a different implementation of `__rand__` in the `SearchQueryCombinable` class within `django/contrib/postgres/search.py`, which correctly combines the objects using the `BITAND` operator.\n\nGiven this information, the search task is not complete. The relevant code spans should include both the `__and__` method from the `Q` class and the `__rand__` method from the `SearchQueryCombinable` class to understand how the combination should be handled correctly and possibly implement a similar approach in the `Combinable` class to resolve the issue.",
