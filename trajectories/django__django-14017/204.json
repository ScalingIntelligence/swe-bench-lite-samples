This suggests a probable missing implementation or a bug in the `__and__` or `__rand__` methods in the `Q` class or related classes. The provided file context indicates that the `Q` class is defined in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and the `Exists` class is defined in `django/db/models/expressions.py`. I should start by exploring these files and their methods, particularly focusing on how `Q` and `Exists` interact with each other using bitwise AND (&) operations.",

Specifically, Q() & Exists(...) raises a TypeError, while Exists(...) & Q() works as expected. The error suggests that there might be a missing definition for the __rand__ method. Upon reviewing the search results, the relevant sections of the code that handle the behavior of the & operator are found in both QuerySet and Q classes. The QuerySet class defines the __and__ method to handle the combination of two QuerySets using the AND logical operator. Similarly, the Q class defines the __and__ method for combining two Q objects. However, the Combinable class, from which Q inherits, does not define the __rand__ method, which could explain the TypeError when trying to combine Q with Exists in the non-commutative manner. This missing method could be the reason for the reported issue. Identifying and implementing the __rand__ method in the Combinable or Q class could potentially resolve the issue.",
