Specifically, Exists(...) & Q(...) works, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. This suggests that the __and__ method in the Q class does not handle the Exists object properly. By examining the provided search results from django/db/models/query_utils.py, it is clear that the Q class lacks an implementation that properly handles the Exists object when used with the '&' operator commutatively. The relevant code spans include the definition of the Q class, its __and__ method, and the _combine method, which is called by __and__. These sections of the code are directly responsible for handling the combination of Q objects, and by extension, should handle Exists objects in a way that avoids the TypeError. The absence of a __rand__ method appears to be the missing piece, as this would enable the reverse operation (Q() & Exists(...)) to function correctly. Identifying these spans helps in understanding where the modification or addition might need to occur to resolve the issue.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` works as expected. The error occurs because `Q().__and__` expects the `other` argument to be an instance of `Q`, and it raises a TypeError if it isn't. The current implementation lacks a reversed version of the `__and__` operation, namely `__rand__`, which is necessary for operations where `Q()` is on the right-hand side. In the provided file context, the `Q` class is defined with methods for combining using `&` (`__and__`) but lacks a method for the reversed operation (`__rand__`). In the search results, the `Expressions.py` file contains the `Combinable` class, which partially addresses this by raising a `NotImplementedError` in `__rand__`, suggesting that support for reversed operators might be intended but not yet fully implemented. This is relevant as it indicates that the issue might be known but not yet addressed in a functional way. Given this, the task suggests that implementing `__rand__` in the `Q` class could resolve the issue.",
