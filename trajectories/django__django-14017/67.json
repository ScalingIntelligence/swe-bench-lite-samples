Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` does not. This suggests a problem with the implementation of the `__rand__` method or related logic in the handling of these objects.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, I see parts of the code in `django/db/models/expressions.py`. Relevant spans include the definition of the `Combinable` class and its method `__rand__`, which raises a `NotImplementedError`. This method is supposed to handle the bitwise AND operation when the left operand is not a `Combinable` instance. Since `Exists` inherits from `Subquery`, and `Subquery` does not override `__rand__`, this method's behavior in `Combinable` is likely causing the issue, failing to handle `Exists` instances.\n\nFurther, the `Exists` class is defined here, but it does not provide any additional handling for the `__&__` operation, nor does it override the `__rand__` method to provide specific behavior for `Exists` objects.\n\nGiven these observations, identifying and fixing the `__rand__` method in a way that correctly handles `Exists` objects in combination with `Q` objects is crucial to addressing the reported issue.",

This suggests a lack of commutativity in the operation, which is likely due to the Exists class missing a definition for __rand__ method. I've found the relevant code spans in the search results that support this hypothesis:\n\n1. In django/db/models/query_utils.py, the Q class has a __and__ method defined, but there's no __rand__ method defined for the Exists class.\n2. In django/db/models/expressions.py, within the Combinable class, there is a __rand__ method defined, but it raises a NotImplementedError. This indicates that the bitwise AND operation is not supported, but it doesn't address the TypeError specifically.\n\nGiven these findings, the solution would likely involve implementing an __rand__ method for the Exists class to make the operation commutative. The relevant code spans identified are from the Combinable class's __rand__ method and the Q class's __and__ method to understand how to properly implement the missing functionality.",

The error occurs in the `__and__` method of the Q class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, where it raises a TypeError if the other object is not an instance of Q. This behavior indicates that Exists objects, which are instances of `django.db.models.expressions.Exists`, are not being recognized as valid operands for the `__and__` method in the Q class.\n\nReviewing the current file context, it's evident that the Exists class does not implement the `__rand__` method, which is needed for the commutative operation in question (Q() & Exists()). The Combinable class, which Exists inherits from, has a `__rand__` method, but it raises a NotImplementedError. This suggests that the Exists class should override or implement the `__rand__` method to handle the operation correctly.\n\nThe new search results confirm that the Q class's `__and__` method relies on the `_combine` method to handle the combination with another object. This method checks if the other object is an instance of Q, and if not, it raises a TypeError. This behavior directly aligns with the reported issue, where an Exists object causes a TypeError due to not being recognized as a valid Q operand.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that the main action item to address the reported issue is to implement the `__rand__` method in the Exists class to handle cases where Q objects are on the left side of the operation (i.e., Q() & Exists()).",
