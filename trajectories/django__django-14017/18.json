In 'query_utils.py', we find class Q defining __and__, which is where the error likely occurs. The 'expressions.py' file defines class Combinable which includes methods like __and__, __or__, and __rand__. The Exists class, a subclass of Subquery, is also defined in 'expressions.py', although the issue does not directly relate to Exists' functionality. The relevant code spans are those containing the definitions of __and__ and __rand__ methods since they deal with combining query conditions, which is the crux of the reported issue.
