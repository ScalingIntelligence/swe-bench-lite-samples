Specifically, `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works as expected, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a `TypeError` due to a missing `__rand__` definition. This suggests that the `Q` class lacks a method to handle the reverse combination, which should be added to ensure the operation is commutative. Analyzing the provided code spans, it's clear that the `Q` class defines `__and__` and `__or__` for combining with `Q` objects, but there's no counterpart for handling objects of other types like `Exists`. The solution would be to add a `__rand__` method to the `Q` class that mirrors the functionality of `__and__`. Similarly, a `__ror__` method should be added to handle `OR` operations with non-Q objects.",

The issue describes a TypeError when using the '&' operator with Q and Exists objects in a specific order (Q() & Exists(...)). This suggests a potential lack of commutative property in the relevant operator methods within the Q and Exists classes potentially due to missing implementations of certain methods like __rand__ and __ror__.\n\nNext, examine the provided file context. Relevant files are 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/expressions.py'. The Q class has methods for __and__, __or__, and __invert__, but no explicit __rand__ or __ror__ methods.\n\nReview new search results to identify any additional code spans relevant to the issue. Relevant spans identified in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' include the Q class definition and its methods involving combination. In 'django/db/models/expressions.py', specific attention is paid to the Combinable class and its methods, including __rand__ and __ror__, addressing some bitwise operations. Notably, Combinable's methods raise NotImplementedError for bitwise operations, suggesting further possible handling.\n\nIn 'django/contrib/postgres/search.py', relevant spans indicate existence of methods __ror__ and __rand__ in the SearchQueryCombinable class that implement combination for search queries, implying potential for similar implementations in other contexts.\n\nBased on the analysis, the search task appears complete, having identified all relevant code spans necessary to address the issue. The primary areas needing attention are the missing commutative (bitwise) operations methods in Q.\n",

Similarly, the Exists class, which inherits from Subquery, has methods for inverting itself but does not explicitly define how it combines with other types, including Q objects. This lack of specific interaction methods between Q and Exists might be causing the TypeError when attempting Q() & Exists(...). To address this, it would be beneficial to explicitly define how these classes interact with each other, potentially by adding __rand__ and __ror__ methods to the Q class and ensuring the Exists class can handle these interactions correctly.",

The new search results confirm this by showing the Exists class with its methods but no explicit support for __rand__ or __ror__ in the Q class. The Combinable class in django/db/models/expressions.py does have these methods (__rand__ and __ror__) but raises NotImplementedError, indicating they are not applicable for the Q class.
