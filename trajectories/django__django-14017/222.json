Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` does not. This suggests that the `__rand__` method might be missing or not implemented correctly for the `Combinable` class. To address this, it's crucial to find the relevant code span that handles the `__rand__` method and ensure it is implemented for the `Exists` object which inherits from `Combinable`. The current implementation raises a `NotImplementedError`, which indicates that it might be the cause of the TypeError. Additionally, verifying the `__and__` method in the `Combinable` class is also important to ensure it correctly handles the combination of Q and Exists objects without raising an error.
