Specifically, `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works as expected, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a `TypeError`. This suggests a missing definition for the `__rand__` method in the `Q` class, as Python first tries to use `__rand__` before `__and__` when performing a right-associative operation. Additionally, the provided minimal example indicates that the error occurs because the `_combine` method in `Q` does not handle non-Q objects gracefully, specifically when the non-Q object is an `Exists` instance. Moreover, there are no definitions for `__rand__` in the `Q` class, which means Python has no fallback method to try if `__and__` fails. Looking at the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` for the `Q` class, `django/db/models/expressions.py` for the `Exists` class, and `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` for a similar `SearchQueryCombinable` class which correctly implements both `__and__` and `__rand__` methods. These findings confirm the hypothesis that defining `__rand__` in the `Q` class could resolve the issue.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(Product.objects.all())` raises a TypeError, whereas `Exists(Product.objects.all()) & Q()` works. The issue suggests that implementing the missing `__rand__` method for the Q class could resolve this problem. The current context already shows relevant parts of the Q and Exists classes in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py`. The new search results continue to provide more context around these classes, particularly the Combinable class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, which is the parent class for Q and may hold clues to a more comprehensive solution. The focus should be on ensuring both `__and__` and `__rand__` methods are correctly implemented in the Q class to allow for the commutative behavior expected when combining with Exists expressions.",
