The error occurs when attempting to combine these objects with the `&` (AND) operator in a specific order, indicating a potential missing implementation of the `__rand__` method. The relevant files to investigate include those defining the `Q`, `Exists`, and `QuerySet` classes as well as their combination logic. Since the `Exists` object is type `django.db.models.expressions.Exists`, focusing on `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py` is crucial. Additionally, the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` and the base behavior of combining queries in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` should be checked for any missing or incorrect method implementations.",

The `Q` class in `query_utils.py` defines the `__and__` method, which currently raises a `TypeError` if the other operand is not an instance of `Q`. The `Exists` class in `expressions.py` lacks the `__rand__` method, which is likely necessary to resolve the issue with commutative operations. Further, the `Combinable` class also has a placeholder `__rand__` method that raises `NotImplementedError`. Enhancing these methods could be the key to resolving the commutative property issue. Given this context, modifications to `Exists` and possibly other related classes like `Combinable` are likely needed to fully address the reported issue.",
