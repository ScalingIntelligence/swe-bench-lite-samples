The error indicates a problem with the Q class not being able to handle the Exists object when the order is reversed (Q() & Exists(...)). This suggests a potential missing definition of the __rand__ method in the Q class or its related classes. To diagnose and potentially fix this, we need to locate the Q class and its methods in the Django source code. Given the files provided in the context, we can focus our search on `django/db/models/query_utils.py` where the Q class is defined, and `django/db/models/expressions.py` where the Exists class is defined. Additionally, since the issue could involve operator overloading or combination logic, we should also consider `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` for any relevant combining or combinator methods.",

The analysis of the provided code reveals that the '__and__' method in the 'Q' class checks if 'other' is an instance of 'Q'. If not, it raises a TypeError. This aligns with the observed behavior, where 'Q() & Exists(...)' fails because 'Q().__and__(Exists(...))' is being called, which does not recognize 'Exists' as a valid operand for 'Q'. However, the 'Combinable' class, which 'Exists' inherits from, has an '__and__' method that attempts to handle combinations with 'Q' and suggests that 'Q' should define '__rand__' to handle reverse operations. The missing '__rand__' method in 'Q' could be the reason for the commutative failure. Importantly, the 'Combinable.__and__' method and the 'Exists' class are crucial for understanding the source of the issue, as they show how 'Exists' interacts with 'Q' in the context of the '&' operator.
