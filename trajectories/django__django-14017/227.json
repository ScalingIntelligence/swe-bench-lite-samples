The error occurs specifically when using the 'and' (&) operator in a non-commutative manner, i.e., Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError, while Exists(...) & Q(...) works. The error suggests that the Q class might be missing a definition for the __rand__ method, which could handle the reverse operation for the 'and' operator. The relevant files identified as potentially containing the logic for these operations include 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', 'django/db/models/expressions.py', and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py'. These files contain classes like Q and Exists and methods such as _combine, __and__, and __rand__ which are crucial for combining expressions. Therefore, the search should focus on these files and specifically look for the implementation of the __rand__ method for the Q class and any related logic handling the combination of Q and Exists objects.",
