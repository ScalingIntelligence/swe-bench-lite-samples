This suggests that there might be an unexpected behavior or missing implementation in the handling of the '&' operator when used with Q and Exists objects. From the search results, several relevant pieces of code have been identified. First, the <span id='Q::__and__'> and <span id='Q::__init__'> spans in the Q class definition in django/db/models/query_utils.py indicate how the '__and__' method is implemented, which is crucial for understanding how the Q object interacts with other objects using the '&' operator. Secondly, the <span id='Combinable::__and__'> and <span id='Combinable::__rand__'> spans in the Combinable class in django/db/models/expressions.py show the implementation of the bitwise '&' operator. These methods raise NotImplementedError, suggesting that perhaps a custom implementation is expected but missing. Lastly, the <span id='Exists::__init__'> span in the Exists class initialization could be relevant as it might interact with Q during the operation, though it doesn't directly address the '&' operator issue. These spans collectively provide insights into where the issue might lie regarding the commutative property of '&' when used with Q and Exists.",
