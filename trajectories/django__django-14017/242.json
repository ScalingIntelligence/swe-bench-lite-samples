Specifically, `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError. This suggests that the `__and__` method in the Q class might be the source of the problem since it expects `other` to be an instance of Q, but it encounters an Exists object instead. The pertinent part of the Exists class from the search results also appears relevant, as it might interact with the Q class during operations. Furthermore, considering the issue mentions a possible missing definition of `__rand__`, which could be necessary to handle the operation when the Exists object is on the left side of the & operator and not the right, this might be the core issue requiring correction. The current context includes the Q class with its `__and__` method, and the search results contain the Exists class with its methods. This alignment allows us to hypothesize that the `__rand__` method might indeed be missing from the Exists class, which would need to be defined to handle instances where an Exists object is the left operand in an `&` operation with a Q object.",

Specifically, `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError. The traceback suggests that the error occurs because `Q` expects another `Q` object in its `_combine` method, but receives an `Exists` object instead, leading to the TypeError.\n\nReviewing the current file context, the relevant code spans include the `Q` class definition and its `__and__` method in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, and the `Exists` class definition in `django/db/models/expressions.py`. These spans already indicate the methods involved in the error.\n\nLooking at the new search results, the most relevant span is the `__rand__` method in the `Combinable` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`. This method is relevant because it suggests that there is no implementation for the reverse bitwise AND operation on the `Combinable` class, which might be the missing functionality preventing `Q(...) & Exists(...)` from functioning correctly, as the issue suggests a missing definition of `__rand__`.\n\nThe `__rand__` method in the `SearchQueryCombinable` class in `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` is also relevant, as it implements the reverse bitwise AND operation, providing a potential solution or reference for implementing the missing functionality in the `Combinable` class.",
