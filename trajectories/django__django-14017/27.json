The issue suggests that there might be a missing definition of '__rand__' method in the relevant class. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the key method in question is '__and__' in the 'Q' class within 'django/db/models/query_utils.py'. This method is responsible for combining two instances of 'Q' with the AND operation. Given the issue described, it is likely that the '__rand__' method needs to be defined to ensure that the '&' operator works correctly regardless of the order of operands.

Initial file context shows the __and__ method in the Q class, which combines two Q objects using AND logic. The new search results provide additional insights mainly within the django/db/models/expressions.py file. Specifically, the Combinable class, which Exists inherits from, includes __and__ and __rand__ methods. Notably, the __and__ method in Combinable attempts to convert self and other to Q objects if they are conditional, similar to the Q class logic. However, the __rand__ method is not defined, which aligns with the suggestion in the issue report that a missing definition of __rand__ might be causing the TypeError when Q() & Exists() is attempted. Therefore, addressing this by defining the __rand__ method in the Combinable class or ensuring commutative behavior by adjusting the existing methods seems crucial.",
