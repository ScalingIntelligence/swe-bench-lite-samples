This error suggests a missing definition of `__rand__` method, which might be related to the `Q` class's ability to handle `Exists` objects in all possible combinations. The relevant files identified from the context are `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, `django/db/models/expressions.py`, and `django/contrib/postgres/search.py`. These files contain the classes `Q`, `Exists`, and `SearchQueryCombinable`, respectively, which might be crucial for addressing the issue. Therefore, the search should focus on these files and check for any missing `__rand__` method implementations or similar discrepancies.",

Specifically, it appears that `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` works as expected. The error message given in the traceback suggests that the issue arises from a missing definition of `__rand__` in the `Q` class or related classes. In the search results, the `Combinable` class has a `__rand__` method that raises a `NotImplementedError`. This could be the missing piece that would allow `Q() & Exists(...)` to work correctly. Based on this understanding, the relevant code spans to address the issue would be those involving the `Combinable` class and the `__rand__` method. Understanding Django's implementation is crucial, but for immediate handling of the issue, we can focus on the Python level method resolution and ensure that `__rand__` is defined where needed.",

The error suggests that there's a missing definition of __rand__ in the relevant classes. \n\nIn the provided file context, it's noted that Combinable class has a __rand__ method that raises a NotImplementedError. This context alongside the search results suggests that the relevant code spans are in the search results under django/db/models/query_utils.py and django/db/models/expressions.py. \n\nThe search results confirm the existence of Q class in django/db/models/query_utils.py which is pivotal in the reported issue and Combinable class in django/db/models/expressions.py where a __rand__ method is defined but not implemented for bitwise operations. This aligns with the requirement identified as missing; \nthere is a need for defining the __rand__ method to handle bitwise operations when combining Q() with Exists().\n\nIt's noteworthy that the search results include additional context around Q and Combinable classes not fully extracted previously, which supports identifying missing methods like __rand__ that could resolve the commutative nature of operator & for Q-Exists pairs. The results from django/contrib/postgres/search.py hint at a possible approach through SearchQueryCombinable's __rand__, suggesting it returns a new instance using BITAND operator. This insight could be considered while addressing the issue in the relevant context.",
