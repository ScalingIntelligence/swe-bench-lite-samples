The error occurs because the `Exists` object is not recognized as a `Q` object in the `_combine` method of the `Q` class. This suggests that there might be an issue with the operator overloading or the handling of the `Exists` object in the context of `Q`. The current analysis of the code shows the implementation of the `Q` class and its methods, but there's no specific handling for `Exists` objects that might explain why `Q() & Exists(...)` fails while `Exists(...) & Q()` works. It's possible that the `Exists` class might need its own operator overload methods to handle these scenarios more gracefully. From the search results, the relevant code spans are primarily within the `query_utils.py` file where the `Q` class is defined, and within `expressions.py` where the `Exists` class might be or where other contextual information for expression handling could be found. Further investigation into how `Exists` objects interact with `Q` objects and specifically into the operator overloading methods within these contexts might reveal the root cause and a potential solution.",

The error suggests that the Q class does not properly handle combining with Exists objects. Specifically, the issue points to a missing definition of __rand__ for the Exists class. This non-commutative behavior implies that the combining logic is incomplete. The currently identified relevant code spans include methods like Q.__and__ and Q._combine in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' which define how Q objects combine, but they lack handling for Exists objects as seen in the TypeError trace. New search results show the 'Combainable.__and__' and 'Exists.__init__' methods in 'django/db/models/expressions.py'. The 'Combainable.__and__' method attempts to handle combination with Q objects, affirming the need for commutative logic. The 'Exists.__init__' method initializes the Exists object but does not address commutative combination. To fully resolve the issue, we need to implement missing commutative methods in the Exists class or ensure such handling in the existing combination methods in the Q class and Combainable class. Therefore, these latest code spans further confirm the need for a fix around the combination logic.",

The Exists class, being a subclass of Subquery, does not define the __rand__ method, which is needed for the 'non-commutative' version of the bitwise AND operation. The solution suggested is to implement the __rand__ method in the Exists class to handle the situation where Exists is on the left side of the & operator and Q is on the right. The search results confirm the existence of the Q class with its __and__ method in query_utils.py and the Exists class in expressions.py, which supports the analysis and confirms the need to implement the missing __rand__ method in the Exists class.",
