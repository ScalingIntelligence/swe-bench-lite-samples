Specifically, `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError. This suggests that there might be a missing definition for the __rand__ method in the relevant classes. Given the stack trace and the error message, the relevant classes and methods to investigate are Q, Exists, and any related combinator methods. The search should focus on the Django model query utilities and expressions to find where the & operator is defined and how it interacts with Exists objects.",

Specifically, the `Q._combine` method is of interest as it raises a `TypeError` if the other object is not an instance of `Q`. This is where the issue described in the reported issue is likely occurring. \n\nNext, I explored the `django/db/models/expressions.py` file, which also contains relevant classes like `Combinable` and `Exists`. It contains the `Combinable.__rand__` method that raises a `NotImplementedError`, suggesting that this method might need to be implemented or adjusted to handle the `Exists` object properly. \n\nFollowing this analysis, I identified the `Combinable` class and its `__rand__` method as potential locations to address the reported issue. The `Exists` class, although relevant, does not directly contribute to the issue as it is handled incorrectly in the `Combinable` class during bitwise operations.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Combinable.__rand__` method should be adjusted to handle the `Exists` object properly or raise a more descriptive error message if handling is not possible.",
