The error indicates that the `__and__` method in the Q class expects the other operand to be an instance of Q, and raises a TypeError if it isn't. This suggests that there might be a missing or improperly implemented `__rand__` method for the Exists class or its base classes. The search results include relevant parts of the Django codebase: the Q class definition in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and the Exists class along with its base class Combinable in `django/db/models/expressions.py`. The Q class has methods `__init__`, `_combine`, and `__and__` which are directly involved in combining Q objects. The Combinable class, which Exists inherits from, has a method `__rand__` that is not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`. This is crucial as the issue might be resolved if the `__rand__` method in the Combinable or Exists class is properly implemented to handle the combination with a Q object. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are the `__rand__` method in the Combinable class and the `__and__` method in the Q class.",

The code spans identified in the <search_results> tag confirm the presence of these classes and methods, notably the Combinable class which includes the __rand__ method, raising a NotImplementedError. This confirms the hypothesis that the issue arises from the lack of a proper implementation for the reverse bitwise AND operation.\n\nGiven this information, the identified spans from the search results align with the reported issue and provide the necessary context to understand the root cause of the TypeError.
