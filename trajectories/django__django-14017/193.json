The error occurs because the __and__ method in the Q class checks if the other object is an instance of Q and raises a TypeError if it isn't. The Exists class, being a subclass of Subquery, does not have a __rand__ method defined, which causes the exception when the operation is performed in the reverse order (i.e., Exists(...) & Q()). To resolve this, it's necessary to ensure that the Exists class (or its superclasses) has a __rand__ method defined to handle the reverse operation correctly. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the __and__ and __rand__ methods in the Combinable class are properly implemented to support logical operations with Q objects.\n\nIn analyzing the search results, the following insights were obtained:\n- The Exists class is situated within the django/db/models/expressions.py file, which is related to database expressions and is thus relevant.\n- The Exists class inherits from Subquery, emphasizing its use in database queries, directly linked to the issue at hand.\n- Within the Combinable class, which is ancestor to Exists, there exists a non-implemented __rand__ method that raises a NotImplementedError. This is the crux of the issue, as it indicates the missing piece to allow for the commutative nature of the & operator between Q and Exists objects.\n\nBased on these findings, it is recommended to add a __rand__ method to the Exists class or ensure that the Combinable class's __rand__ method properly supports the operation with Q objects. This would ensure that both Q() & Exists(...) and Exists(...) & Q() operations work without raising a TypeError.",
