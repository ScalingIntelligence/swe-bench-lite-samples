Analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file. Specifically, the method `Q.__and__` calls `Q._combine`, which raises the TypeError if the `other` object is not an instance of `Q`. This implies that the `Exists` object, which is not an instance of `Q`, triggers the error when used with the `&` operator. To address the issue, it seems necessary to define the `__rand__` method in the `Q` class to handle the reverse operation with non-Q objects like `Exists`. However, this method does not currently exist in the provided code spans, which explains why the `Exists & Q` operation works but `Q & Exists` does not. The solution likely involves adding a `__rand__` method to handle such cases.",
