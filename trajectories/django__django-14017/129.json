The error suggests that the __and__ method in the Q class does not handle instances of Exists correctly, leading to a TypeError. To address this issue, we need to ensure that the Q class's __and__ method can handle Exists objects appropriately. From the search results, the relevant spans are located in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/expressions.py'. In 'query_utils.py', the Q class's __and__ method (span id='Q.__and__') is responsible for combining Q objects with the AND operator. This is where the error originates from. Additionally, in 'expressions.py', the Exists class (span id='Exists') is relevant as it represents the Exists expression in Django's ORM. To fix the issue, the __and__ method in the Q class needs to be updated to handle Exists objects correctly, possibly by defining the missing __rand__ method. These spans are crucial for understanding and resolving the reported issue.",
