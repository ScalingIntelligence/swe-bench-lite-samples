The error message suggests that the 'Q' class expects an instance of itself, or at least an object that it can handle, but instead receives an 'Exists' object. This discrepancy is likely the cause of the TypeError. The existing context points to relevant Django ORM classes such as 'Q', 'Exists', 'QuerySet', and their methods like '__and__', '__or__', '_combine', etc. These are the likely places where the issue could be originating. To address the issue, we need to focus the search on the 'Q' and 'Exists' classes, particularly looking at how they handle operations like '__and__' and '__rand__'. Specifying the 'class_names' and 'function_names' should help narrow down the search to exactly where the problem might be occurring.",

This aligns with the observed behavior in the provided code spans. The relevant code spans include the definition of the Q class, the __init__ method which initializes the Q object, the _combine method which is used to combine Q objects, and the __and__ method which attempts to combine two objects using the '&' operator.

Looking at the provided context and search results, the relevant file 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/expressions.py' contain the classes 'Q' and 'Exists', which are directly related to this issue. In the 'Q' class, the '__and__' method and the '_combine' method are responsible for combining Q objects with an 'AND' operation. The TypeError is raised because the '_combine' method expects 'other' to be an instance of 'Q', but in this case, it is an instance of 'Exists', causing the TypeError. The 'Combinable' class in 'expressions.py' contains the '__rand__' method, which could potentially be used to implement the reverse operation (Exists & Q). However, this method raises a NotImplementedError, suggesting that this functionality is not currently implemented or allowed. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans to address this issue would be those involving the '__and__' and '_combine' methods in the 'Q' class and the '__rand__' method in the 'Combinable' class, as they pertain directly to the operation at hand.",
