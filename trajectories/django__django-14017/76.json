The analysis of the provided search results shows relevant sections of the Q class, including the `__and__` method, but there's no mention of `__rand__`. Additionally, the Exists class is found, but without any direct impact on the reported issue since the problem seems to be in the Q class handling. Given the context and the issue's description, implementing or checking the `__rand__` method in the Q class would likely resolve the issue by allowing the Q object to handle the '&' operation when it appears on the right-hand side.",

The current context and search results show that the `Combinable` class within `django/db/models/expressions.py` has a method `__rand__` defined, but it raises `NotImplementedError`. This likely means that `Exists` objects, which are expected to behave like `Combinable` objects, are not properly handled when used with `Q` objects in a reverse bitwise AND operation.
