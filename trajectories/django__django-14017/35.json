Specifically, 'Exists(...) & Q(...)' works, but 'Q(...) & Exists(...)' raises a TypeError. This suggests that the '__and__' method in the Q class is not correctly handling Exists objects when they appear on the right-hand side. To address this, we need to ensure that the Q class has the appropriate methods to handle Exists objects in a commutative manner. The search results provide the relevant code spans for the Q class, but it's notable that the '__rand__' method is missing, which could be the reason for the commutative issue. Based on the context provided and the specific issue, the identified code spans include the '__init__', '__or__', '__and__', '__invert__', and 'resolve_expression' methods of the Q class. These are essential for understanding how the Q class combines or interacts with other expressions, but the absence of '__rand__' might be the root cause of the reported issue.",

This points to a potential missing definition of `__rand__` in the `Q` class or related classes.\n\nFirst, I reviewed the existing context in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, which contains the `Q` class definition, including methods like `__or__`, `__and__`, and `__invert__`. Notably, `__and__` uses `_combine` which checks if the other object is an instance of `Q` and raises a `TypeError` if not, which aligns with the reported error.\n\nNext, I analyzed the new search results. In `django/db/models/expressions.py`, the `Combinable` class has a method `__rand__` that raises a `NotImplementedError`. This might be relevant as it indicates that the `Exists` class might not support the reverse bitwise `and` operation directly. However, the `Exists` class itself does not have a `__rand__` method, aligning with the suggestion that a missing `__rand__` method might be causing the issue.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans to address the issue should focus on the `Q` class for modifications to handle the Exists object when performing operations, ensuring that the operations are commutative. Additionally, the `Exists` class or related classes might need adjustments, particularly to support reverse operations.\n\nGiven the analysis, the identified spans include the `Q.__and__` method which raises the TypeError and places where Exists is used, such as in the `Combinable.__rand__` method. These are marked for further review and potential modifications to ensure commutative operations between Q and Exists.",

The commutative property of the & operator is expected to work with Q and Exists, but the TypeError indicates that there's a missing definition of __rand__ method in the Combinable class or in the Q class. The search results include the relevant code spans from django/db/models/query_utils.py and django/db/models/expressions.py.\n\nIn the Combinable class, there's a defined __rand__ method which raises a NotImplementedError, suggesting that bitwise operations should not be used directly. This might be the cause of the issue, as the error could be triggered when the left operand is not of type Q. In the Q class definition, there are the __and__ and __or__ methods defined, but no __rand__ or __ror__ methods, which might be necessary to handle the case where the left operand is not a Q object.\n\nGiven these observations, it appears that the issue might be addressed by implementing the __rand__ method in the Q class to handle cases where Q is the right operand and the left operand is not a Q object. This method would need to ensure that the left operand can be combined correctly with Q objects to avoid the TypeError. The relevant code spans to consider for implementing this solution are those related to the Q class and the Combinable class.",
