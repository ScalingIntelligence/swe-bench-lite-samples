To address this, I will focus on the `__and__` method in the Q class and related methods in the search results to identify where the problem might lie.\n\nIn the search results, the Q class is defined in django/db/models/query_utils.py. I have identified several relevant spans including the `__and__` method which combines two instances of Q using the AND operator. The method is defined in a way that it only allows combining with another Q object. If it encounters something else, it raises a TypeError. This could be the source of the issue when trying to use Exists with Q.\n\nGiven these findings, I will extract the relevant spans from the search results that involve the Q class and its `__and__` method.",

This suggests a potential problem with the implementation of the `__and__` method in the `Q` class or a missing `__rand__` method in the `Exists` or `Combinable` class.\n\nReviewing the current file context, the `Q` class and its `__and__` method are defined, but there's no explicit mention of a `__rand__` method in the `Q` class. This is significant because the error might be due to the absence of a `__rand__` method, which Python would call for operations where the `Q` object is on the right-hand side.\n\nIn the new search results, there are two main files of interest: `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. The `django/db/models/expressions.py` file contains the `Combinable` class, which has a `__rand__` method that raises a `NotImplementedError`. This suggests that the `Exists` object, which likely inherits from `Combinable`, does not handle being on the right-hand side of bitwise AND operations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are those related to the `Combinable` class, particularly the `__rand__` method, as well as the `Q` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`.\n\nThe next steps could include implementing or ensuring that a proper `__rand__` method is defined in the `Combinable` or related classes to handle bitwise AND operations when the `Q` object is on the right-hand side.
