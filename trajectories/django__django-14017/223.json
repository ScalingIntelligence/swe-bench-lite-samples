The provided file context and search results confirm the existence of the Q class and its __and__ method in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', which attempts to combine Q objects using the AND connector. However, the issue suggests that the operation should be commutative, meaning both Exists(...) & Q(...) and Q(...) & Exists(...) should work. The missing commutative operation might be due to the absence of the __rand__ method in the relevant classes, as indicated by the issue. The new search results confirm the existence of the Combinable class and its __rand__ method in 'django/db/models/expressions.py', which is currently raising a NotImplementedError. Given these findings, it's clear that implementing or modifying the __rand__ method in the Combinable class could resolve the reported issue. Additionally, reviewing how Exists objects are integrated with Q objects in the context of these operations is crucial for ensuring commutative behavior.",
