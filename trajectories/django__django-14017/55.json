Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(...) & Q()` does not.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the relevant parts of the codebase include:\n\n1. **django/db/models/query_utils.py**\n   - **Q class**: This class defines the `Q` object used for constructing complex queries.\n   - **Q.__and__ method**: This method is responsible for combining `Q` objects using the `&` operator.\n   - **Q._combine method**: This method is used by `Q.__and__` to combine `Q` objects.\n\n2. **django/db/models/expressions.py**\n   - **Combinable class**: This class defines `__and__` and `__rand__` methods, which are relevant for combining expressions using the `&` operator.\n   - **Exists class**: This class is used to represent an SQL EXISTS expression.\n\nThe key issue seems to be that the `Q._combine` method raises a TypeError if the `other` object is not an instance of `Q`. This is likely the root cause of the reported issue, as the `Exists` object is not recognized as a `Q` object when using the `&` operator from the `Q` object.\n\nTo fix this, it is suggested that a missing definition of `__rand__` for the `Exists` object might be needed. However, based on the provided search results, there is no explicit `__rand__` method defined for the `Exists` class or the `Combinable` class.\n\nThus, the identified spans should help address the reported issue by providing a basis for further modification or addition of the `__rand__` method to ensure compatibility between `Q` and `Exists` objects using the `&` operator.",
