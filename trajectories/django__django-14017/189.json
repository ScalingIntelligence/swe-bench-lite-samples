Specifically, it notes that `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works, but `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError. To address this, we need to locate the code where the `&` operator is defined for Q objects and identify if there's a missing definition of `__rand__` method to ensure commutative behavior.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, we find relevant code spans in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. The `Q` class defines the `__and__` method but lacks a definition for `__rand__`. This absence could explain why `Q() & Exists(...)` fails even though `Exists(...) & Q()` works. It's plausible that implementing `__rand__` in the `Q` class to handle the reverse order of operations could resolve the issue.\n\nIn the context of the Exists class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, it doesn't appear to directly influence the commutative behavior of the `&` operator with Q objects, as it doesn't override any magic methods related to bitwise operations. Therefore, the focus should remain on the `Q` class and its handling of bitwise operations with non-Q objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's reasonable to suggest that defining the `__rand__` method in the `Q` class should be explored as a potential solution to the issue.",

The error occurs because `Q().__and__(Exists(...))` expects `other` to be an instance of `Q` but receives an `Exists` object instead. This issue can be addressed by implementing the `__rand__` method for the `Q` class to handle the case where `Q` is the right operand. The current context has relevant code spans defined in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py`. The search results confirm the existence of the `Exist` class that needs to be combined with `Q`, but the `Q` class lacks the `__rand__` method to handle it. To fix the reported issue, it's necessary to add the `__rand__` method to the `Q` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` to correctly handle the combination with an `Exists` object when `Q` is the right operand. This will ensure that the `&` operator is commutative for `Q` and `Exists` pairs. Additionally, reviewing the `Exists` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` shows it subclassing `Subquery`, which aligns with the expected behavior for the `&` operation. The presence of the `__rand__` method in `SearchQueryCombinable` in `django/contrib/postgres/search.py` supports the idea that such a method is necessary to resolve the issue for the general case.",
