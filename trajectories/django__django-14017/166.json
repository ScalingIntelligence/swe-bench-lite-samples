The specific problem is that while `Exists(...) & Q(...)` works, `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError. The issue suggests that there might be a missing definition of `__rand__` for the `Q` class.\n\nIn the search results, we find the `Q` class defined in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. Key methods related to the issue include `__and__` and `_combine`. The `__and__` method uses `_combine` to handle the logical AND operation between `Q` objects. The `_combine` method checks if the `other` object is an instance of `Q`; if not, it raises a TypeError, which matches the observed behavior in the issue.\n\nAdditionally, in the `Expressions.py` file, we find the `Combinable` class which defines various dunder methods for combining objects. Notably, there are methods for `__or__`, `__add__`, `__truediv__`, etc., but no explicit `__rand__` method. This absence could explain why the reverse operation `Q(...) & Exists(...)` fails, as it attempts to use a method (`__rand__`) that does not exist.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans are those that define the `Q` class and its combination methods, specifically the `__and__` and `_combine` methods in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. Additionally, the absence of `__rand__` in the `Combinable` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` is likely the root cause of the issue.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError while `Exists(...) & Q()` works. The issue suggests that there might be a missing definition of `__rand__` method which could resolve the commutative nature of these operations.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, we initially identified the definition of `Q` and its methods in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. The methods `__init__`, `_combine`, and `__and__` are defined for the `Q` class but do not include a `__rand__` method. This aligns with the issue's suggestion that `__rand__` might be missing.\n\nIn the `search_results`, additional surrounding context for the `Exists` class is provided within `django/db/models/expressions.py`. This includes the definition of `Combinable` class with its `__rand__` method. Notably, the `Exists` class inherits from `Subquery`, which does not override any of the `Combinable` methods.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the `__rand__` method, which is part of the `Combinable` class, should be considered when addressing the reported issue. Since `Exists` does not implement its own `__rand__`, the logic in the `Combinable.__rand__` method should be relevant, especially considering it raises a `NotImplementedError`, which suggests it is not intended for the use described in the issue. This indicates a potential need to modify or implement a new method for handling the combination of `Q` and `Exists` objects in a way that avoids this TypeError.",
