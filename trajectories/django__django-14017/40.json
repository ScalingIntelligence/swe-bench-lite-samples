Specifically, Exists(...) & Q(...) works, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. This suggests a potential missing definition of the `__rand__` method in the relevant class, given that `__and__` is defined for Q objects but not in such a way that it can handle Exists objects on the left-hand side of the operation. Given the error message, it's clear that we should focus on the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file, where the Q class is defined, and possibly other files where Exists logic might be encapsulated or checked. We should also be on the lookout for any custom implementations of combinators in related modules to ensure there's no overloading misalignment.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError, suggesting that a commutative operation between these two objects is not correctly implemented. The search results provide relevant code spans in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py`. In `query_utils.py`, the `Q` class is defined with methods `__and__` and `_combine`, which handle combining `Q` objects. The `Q.__and__` method calls `_combine`, which raises a TypeError if the `other` object is not an instance of `Q`. This is likely where the error is occurring. In `expressions.py`, the `Combinable` class includes the `__and__` and `__rand__` methods, which handle bitwise logical operations. The `__rand__` method is particularly relevant as it raises a NotImplementedError, suggesting it needs to be defined for commutative operations between `Q` and `Exists` objects to work correctly. The `Exists` class, which subclasses `Subquery`, does not have specific methods for `__and__` or `__rand__`. This indicates a potential missing definition for `__rand__` in the `Exists` class, as suggested in the reported issue.",
