Specifically, the TypeError occurs when the order of operations is Q() & Exists(...), whereas Exists(...) & Q() works correctly. This suggests that the problem might lie in how the Q class handles the '&' operator with non-Q objects like Exists. The Exists class is known to interact with the Q class in queries, and the error message indicates that the Q class expects the right-hand side of the '&' operator to be an instance of Q. This discrepancy likely arises from the lack of a __rand__ method in the Exists class or the Q class not handling Exists objects appropriately in its __and__ method. To address this, it would be beneficial to review the __and__ method in both the Q and Exists classes for any missing definitions or improper handling of heterogeneous objects. Additionally, checking if Exists properly defines __rand__ might also be crucial for resolving the commutative property issue.",

The search results include relevant code spans in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/expressions.py`. In `query_utils.py`, the `Q` class, its `_combine` method, and the `__and__` method are identified as relevant. The `_combine` method checks if the `other` object is an instance of `Q` and raises a TypeError if it is not, which aligns with the observed error. In `expressions.py`, the `Combinable` class and its `__and__`, `__or__`, and `__rand__` methods are found, which also relate to the & and | operators. No `__rand__` method is defined for `Combinable`, suggesting a possible missing definition that could address the reported issue.",

The file context shows that the Q class's __and__ method expects the 'other' object to be an instance of Q and raises a TypeError otherwise. This aligns with the issue description, suggesting that the __rand__ method might be missing or not properly implemented in the Exists class or related classes, leading to the commutative property issue when using the '&' operator with Q and Exists objects.
