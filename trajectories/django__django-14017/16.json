Specifically, using Q() & Exists(...) raises a TypeError, while Exists(...) & Q() works. This suggests that the issue may be related to the implementation of the __and__ method in Q or Exists, or possibly the handling of these objects in the related classes. The files provided include django/db/models/query_utils.py and django/db/models/expressions.py, which are likely places to start looking. Additionally, the django/db/models/sql/query.py file could be relevant due to its handling of queries. Searching for the specific error message and focusing on these files should help pinpoint the problem.",

Specifically, `Q() & Exists(Product.objects.all())` raises a TypeError, while `Exists(Product.objects.all()) & Q()` does not. The issue suggests that the & operator should be commutative for Q-Exists pairs but isn't due to a missing definition of __rand__ in the relevant classes.\n\nUpon reviewing the code spans in the search results, it's clear that both `Q` and `Exists` classes are involved. The `Q` class defines methods like `__and__`, `__or__`, and `_combine`, but it does not define __rand__ which could handle the reverse operation as suggested in the issue. Additionally, the `Exists` class exists within the `django/db/models/expressions.py` file and is a subclass of `Subquery`, but it does not override any special methods related to combining expressions.\n\nRelevant code spans are:\n1. `django/db/models/query_utils.py` for the `Q` class, especially the `__and__` method and the `_combine` method.\n2. `django/db/models/expressions.py` for the `Exists` class.\n3. Other related code spans in both files could be examined contextually but seem less directly relevant based on the issue description.\n\nIt's recommended to look into implementing the missing __rand__ method in the `Q` class or examining the `_combine` method logic to ensure it handles all types of arguments correctly, possibly including Exists objects.",
