Specifically, Exists(...) & Q(...) works, but Q(...) & Exists(...) raises a TypeError. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the Q class handles the Exists object during the combination process. From the search results, the relevant code spans include the definition of the Q class and its methods __and__, __or__, __invert__, and _combine. These methods are crucial for the logic behind combining Q objects and handling Exists objects. Additionally, the Exists class definition and its methods are relevant as they show how the Exists object interacts with Q objects during operations. To resolve the reported issue, it's likely that a missing __rand__ method in the Q class needs to be implemented to handle the reverse operation of & with an Exists object on the left side correctly.",
