            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a problem with the `Mod` function not properly handling non-integer bases in certain cases. Specifically, the issue points out that the current evaluation logic does not check if the base is an integer, which leads to incorrect results when the base is not an integer. This discrepancy is evident in the example provided, where `Mod(x**2, x)` returns 0 for integer `x` but returns `0.75` when `x` is `1.5`. The current `eval` logic in the `Mod` class does not account for non-integer bases, so the `Mod` function incorrectly returns `0` in cases where it should not.\n\nReviewing the `Mod.eval` code span, it is clear that the code checks for conditions such as `p == q` or `p == -q` but does not explicitly check if `p.base` (when `p` is a `Pow`) is an integer. This oversight seems to be the root cause of the reported issue. Further, the `Power.eval` logic also does not check for the base's integer status before allowing modulus operations.\n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code span would be within the `Mod.eval` method, which needs to be amended to ensure that it checks if `p.base` is an integer when `p` is a `Pow`. This would help in triggering an appropriate return value when the base is not an integer, thus preventing the incorrect modulus calculation that occurs in the case of non-integer bases. Additionally, it might be necessary to evaluate similar checks in other parts of the code that deal with modulus operations to ensure consistency.",

My analysis of the search results and file context reveals that the relevant code spans are primarily in `sympy/core/mod.py`, specifically in the `Mod.eval` method where the condition for returning `S.Zero` is defined. The search results confirm the presence of this method and highlight the condition that needs to be adjusted to account for non-integer bases. Additionally, the `Pow` class methods in `sympy/core/power.py` are relevant for understanding how powers are evaluated and properties are checked, which is indirectly related to the issue since `x**2` involves powers. Overall, the identified code spans are sufficient to resolve the issue by enhancing the `Mod.eval` method to explicitly check for integer bases.",
