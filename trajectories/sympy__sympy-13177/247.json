The provided snippet of `Mod`'s eval method indicates it checks for certain conditions but does not explicitly ensure that the base of the power is an integer. This oversight leads to incorrect results when the base is a non-integer. To address this, the relevant code to find is in the `Mod` class where the `eval` method is defined, and possibly also in related methods that handle power evaluation. Additionally, the files listed might be relevant as they include classes and methods that deal with powers and integers.",

Specifically, it points out that the code does not check if the base of the power is an integer before deciding that Mod(x**2, x) should be 0. The relevant portion of the code to address this issue is in the eval method of the Mod class, where the condition checks if p is a power and if the exponent is an integer, but does not check if the base is an integer.\n\nFrom the provided search results, we can see the complete eval method of the Mod class, which includes the problematic condition. This method needs to be corrected to properly handle cases where the base of the power is not an integer. Additionally, I've noted that there are other evaluation methods (_eval_is_integer, _eval_is_nonnegative, _eval_is_nonpositive) that might also need similar checks if the issue is to be fully resolved and robustness added to the code.",
