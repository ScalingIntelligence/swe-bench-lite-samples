The provided search results include the definition and eval method of the 'Mod' class in the file 'sympy/core/mod.py'. The relevant code spans are those within the 'Mod.eval' method, particularly the section that checks if the expression 'p' is a power operation and whether the base of this operation matches the modulus 'q'. This code currently only checks for integer exponents but does not check the type of the base, which aligns with the reported issue.
