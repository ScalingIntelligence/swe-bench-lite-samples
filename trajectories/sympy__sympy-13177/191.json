The current eval logic in `Mod` does not explicitly check if the base is an integer before returning `S.Zero`, which leads to incorrect results when the base is a non-integer. To address this, the `eval` method in the `Mod` class needs to be examined and potentially adjusted to ensure the base is an integer before making the evaluation. The provided search results include the `eval` method of the `Mod` class where the issue might reside. The `Mod.eval` span contains the logic for evaluating `p` and `q` which includes a condition that does not account for non-integer bases. This condition is: `if (p == q or p == -q or p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or p.is_integer and q == 1): return S.Zero`. This condition should be modified to include a check for integer bases, thereby preventing incorrect evaluations when the base is a non-integer. The `Pow` class from the `sympy/core/power.py` file is referenced as it may contain additional logic related to handling powers, specifically the `base` property. However, the immediate issue is centered around the `Mod` class's `eval` method, and thus the relevant span is `Mod.eval`.",

This is evidenced by the provided code snippet, where the condition `p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q` does not ensure that `p.base` is an integer. To address this, we need to integrate logic from the `Pow` class into the `eval` method of the `Mod` class to handle non-integer bases correctly. Specifically, we should add a check to ensure that `p.base` is an integer before proceeding with the modulus operation. If `p.base` is not an integer, the `eval` method should handle this appropriately, potentially by raising an error or returning a specific result that indicates the invalid operation.",
