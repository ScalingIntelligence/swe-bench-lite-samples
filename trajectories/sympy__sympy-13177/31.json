I reviewed the provided search results and focused on the Mod class definition and its eval method, which contains the logic for the modulus operation. The key part of the code is the conditional check within the eval method that returns S.Zero under certain conditions. The issue indicates that one of these conditions, specifically when p is a power and its base equals q, does not account for whether the base is an integer. As a result, when a non-integer base is used, the expected Mod result is not obtained. This finding aligns with the reported issue, identifying the source of the problem.",
