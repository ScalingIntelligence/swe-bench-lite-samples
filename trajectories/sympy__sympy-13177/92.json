The provided search results confirm that the eval method logic in Mod is indeed the concern, as it lacks the specific integer check for the base when dealing with powers. Additionally, the context shows that the method doesn't handle non-integer bases in the way expected (i.e., returning 0 for reals as it does for integers). The search results also include additional methods like _eval_is_integer, _eval_is_nonnegative, and _eval_is_nonpositive in the Mod class, which are irrelevant to the current issue as they deal with other aspects of the class's behavior.
