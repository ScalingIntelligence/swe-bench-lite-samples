The LaTeX printer should follow the logical order of monomials, from highest to lowest degrees, similar to the str and pretty printers. After analyzing the provided search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans deal with the LaTeX, str, and pretty printers for the Poly object. In the LaTeX printer (`LatexPrinter._print_Poly`), the monomials are printed without explicitly sorting them according to degree. This is the likely cause of the issue. In contrast, the str (`StrPrinter._print_Poly`) and pretty (`PrettyPrinter._print_Poly`) printers both sort the monomials before printing them, ensuring the correct order is maintained. Therefore, the identified code spans highlight the need to adjust the LaTeX printer to sort the monomials in descending order of degrees before formatting them for LaTeX output. This change should align the LaTeX printer's behavior with that of the str and pretty printers.",
