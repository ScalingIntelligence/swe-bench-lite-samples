The key function to investigate for this issue is '_print_Poly' in the LatexPrinter class. This function constructs the LaTeX representation of a Poly object. Currently, it prints the expression in the order it receives from 'poly.as_expr()', which does not guarantee the sorting order needed to match the logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees as in pretty and str printers. The relevance of this function is high as it directly concerns the LaTeX printing functionality for Poly objects. The existing code passes the expression obtained from 'poly.as_expr()' to '_print' and does not sort the monomials explicitly. This is likely where the order discrepancy arises. The solution likely involves sorting the monomials in 'poly.as_expr()' before passing them to the printer, or alternatively, sorting them within the '_print_Poly' function itself.

The issue points towards a discrepancy in how the latex printer organizes the monomials compared to the other printers. The file context provided includes relevant sections from 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/polys/polytools.py', which are crucial for understanding the LaTeX printing process and the conversion of Poly objects to expressions. Specifically, the '_print_Poly' method in 'LatexPrinter' class directly handles the LaTeX representation of Poly objects, indicating that the order issue might originate from this method or upstream methods such as 'as_expr'. Also, the 'as_expr' method and related functions in 'polytools.py' are identified as key points to investigate further, as they construct the expression form of Poly objects, potentially influencing the monomial order. Although these areas are substantial for addressing the issue, the file context provided does not include the methods or logic in 'polytools.py' responsible for the actual ordering of monomials during the conversion process, which could be essential in pinpointing the cause of the discrepancy.
