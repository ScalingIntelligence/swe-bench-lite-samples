The LaTeX printer seems to use a different order, which is not aligned with the logical order from highest to lowest degrees as used by str and pretty printers. Given the context, the focus should be on the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class within the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file. This method likely contains the logic for printing Poly objects in LaTeX format. Further, it might be beneficial to compare this with the `_print_Poly` method in `StrPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/str.py` to understand the order difference.",

In the `StrPrinter`, the `_print_Poly` method sorts the terms correctly, as indicated by the logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees. However, in the `LatexPrinter`, the `_print_Poly` method does not appear to sort the terms in the same way. Instead, it directly converts the polynomial expression to LaTeX without reordering the monomials. This discrepancy between the two printers is the cause of the issue. Identifying the relevant code spans in the `LatexPrinter` class will help in addressing the issue by ensuring the monomials are ordered correctly during LaTeX conversion.",
