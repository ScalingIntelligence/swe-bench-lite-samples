The key line in this context is where it converts the polynomial expression to LaTeX format: 'expr = self._print(poly.as_expr())'. This suggests that the order of monomials in the LaTeX printer might not be aligned with the expected order because it directly prints the expression without any specific reordering or sorting that could match the desired sequence found in the str and pretty printers.

The LaTeX printer does not maintain the same order from highest to lowest degrees as the other printers. To address this, we need to identify where in the LaTeX printer's code this order is determined or could be adjusted. I see that the LatexPrinter class has a method _print_Poly which handles the LaTeX printing of Poly objects. This method constructs the LaTeX representation of the polynomial, but it does not explicitly sort the monomials by degree. Instead, it relies on the natural order produced by poly.as_expr(). To fix the issue, we likely need to introduce a sorting step within the _print_Poly method, where we order the monomials according to their degrees before constructing the LaTeX string. The relevant part of the code is the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class.",
