The provided search results contain relevant code from the `sympy/printing/latex.py` module, specifically the `LatexPrinter` class. Notable functions include `__init__` and `_print_Poly`. The `_print_Poly` method appears to be the primary area of interest as it handles the conversion of a Poly object to its LaTeX representation. Within this method, the sequence of monomials is determined by `poly.as_expr()`, which suggests that the order might not be explicitly controlled within this function. This observation aligns with the issue of inconsistent monomial order in LaTeX output. Given this information, it is clear that the `_print_Poly` function in the `LatexPrinter` class is directly related to the reported issue. Thus, the relevant code spans are those that pertain to the LaTeX printing of Poly objects.",
