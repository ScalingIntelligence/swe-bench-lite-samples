The LaTeX printer does not maintain the same logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees as the other printers do. I reviewed the search results to identify the relevant code spans. In `sympy/printing/latex.py`, the `LatexPrinter` class includes a method `_print_Poly` that handles the LaTeX printing of Poly objects. This method converts the Poly object to its expression form and constructs the LaTeX string directly. However, it appears that the ordering of the monomials is not explicitly controlled in this method, which could be the reason for the discrepancy observed. Additionally, I reviewed `sympy/printing/str.py` to compare the implementation of `_print_Poly` in the StrPrinter class, which handles the string representation of Poly objects. The str printer meticulously constructs the terms based on the monomial degrees, ensuring the correct order. To resolve the issue, the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class likely needs to be adjusted to ensure the monomials are ordered from highest to lowest degrees before constructing the LaTeX string.",

This method ensures that the terms are printed in the logical order, from highest to lowest degrees. To apply similar logic in latex.py, we need to modify the _print_Poly method to sort the terms of the polynomial before converting them to LaTeX. The current implementation in latex.py does not specify any ordering, and thus the terms are printed in the order they appear in the Poly object. By sorting the terms before printing, we can align the LaTeX printer's behavior with the str printer's, ensuring consistency in monomial ordering across different printers. This involves adding a sorting mechanism that orders the terms in the polynomial based on the degrees of their monomials, from highest to lowest.",
