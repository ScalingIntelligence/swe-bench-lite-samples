This method is responsible for converting a Poly object into its LaTeX representation. The current implementation does not seem to ensure that the monomials are ordered from highest to lowest degree, which is the issue reported. The `as_expr()` method call within `_print_Poly` might be the reason for the different ordering, as it could convert the Poly object into an expression without preserving the monomial order. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those that deal with the conversion from Poly to LaTeX specifically in the `_print_Poly` method.",
