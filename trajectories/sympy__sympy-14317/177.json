This discrepancy can be observed in the output of the LaTeX printer for a Poly object, where the monomials are not ordered from highest to lowest degrees as expected. To address this, the relevant section of the codebase to inspect is the `_print_Poly` method within the `LatexPrinter` class. This method is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of a Poly object. The problem seems to lie in how the expression is printed within this method. Specifically, the expression is generated by converting the Poly object to its expression form and then printing it, without any specific ordering mechanism applied during the conversion or printing process. This leads to the LaTeX output not adhering to the logical order of monomials as observed in the pretty and str representations. Therefore, the relevant code span to focus on is the `_print_Poly` method, where the ordering issue can be fixed either by ensuring the expression is ordered before printing or by applying a different printing logic that respects the monomial order.",
