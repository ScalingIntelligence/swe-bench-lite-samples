From the search results, it is evident that the order of monomials is handled differently in the LaTeX printer compared to the str printer. The LatexPrinter._print_Poly method directly converts the polynomial to an expression using self._print(poly.as_expr()), which might not maintain the order of monomials as expected. On the other hand, the str method in PolyElement explicitly sorts the monomials in a desired order before constructing the string representation. To resolve the issue, the LaTeX printer should also sort the monomials before generating the LaTeX string. The PolyElement._sorted method is a good reference for how to correctly sort the monomials based on the order, which could be integrated into the LatexPrinter._print_Poly method.",
