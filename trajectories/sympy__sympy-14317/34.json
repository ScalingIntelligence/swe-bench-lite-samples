This method is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of a Poly object. The current implementation of _print_Poly does not explicitly sort the monomials in the desired order. The relevant code spans include the definition of the LatexPrinter class and its _print_Poly method, which needs to be modified to ensure the monomials are sorted in descending degree order. Additionally, the PolyElement class in rings.py should be considered since it defines the structure of Poly objects and can help understand the sorting logic for rendering purposes. The _sorted method in PolyElement seems particularly relevant as it sorts terms based on the specified order.",
