The str and pretty printers use the logical order from highest to lowest degrees, while the LaTeX printer does not. This suggests that the problem lies in how the LaTeX printer processes the Poly object for rendering. The relevant code spans are likely in the LatexPrinter class method _print_Poly, where the Poly object might be processed in a different order compared to the str and pretty printers. Additionally, the PolyElement class's sorting method _sorted and its terms method might also be relevant, as they relate to the sorting of monomials which the LaTeX printer is not following correctly. These code spans, _print_Poly in latex.py and _sorted in rings.py, are important to examine and adjust if necessary to ensure the LaTeX printer follows the same order as the other printers.",

The method does not explicitly address the order of monomials, relying instead on the generic conversion of the polynomial to an expression and the subsequent printing of its components. The lack of specific handling for monomial order within this method suggests that the order might get determined elsewhere in the process. The `_sorted` method in `PolyElement` in `sympy/polys/rings.py` is crucial for understanding how the polynomial elements are sorted, which could directly influence the printing order.

The LaTeX printer does not respect the logical order from highest to lowest degrees as the other printers do. The relevant files identified are 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/polys/rings.py'. The code span in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' that directly relates to the LaTeX printing of a Poly object is '_print_Poly'. This method constructs the LaTeX representation of the Poly object but does not currently sort the monomials in the required order. The corresponding method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' that sorts the monomials is '_sorted'. This method can be used to ensure the monomials are sorted before generating the LaTeX output. To address the issue, the '_print_Poly' method should utilize the '_sorted' method to order the monomials appropriately before constructing the LaTeX string.",

This might explain why the LaTeX output does not match the order seen in other printers like str and pretty. To resolve this, it's necessary to ensure that the `_print_Poly` method respects the desired order of monomials. This could involve modifying the method to explicitly sort monomials according to the specified order before formatting them for LaTeX output. Additionally, inspecting the `_sorted` method in `PolyElement` could provide further insight into how the sorting of monomials is currently being handled and potentially identify any issues with the sort order.",
