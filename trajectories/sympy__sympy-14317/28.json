The 'Poly' class and its 'as_expr' method found in the search results are also relevant because they handle the polynomial expression which is then processed by the LaTeX printer.

Upon examining the relevant code in the LaTeX printer, specifically the `_print_Poly` method, it appears that the monomials are being directly converted to a LaTeX string without any specific sorting or reordering. This lack of sorting is likely causing the discrepancy in order between the LaTeX and other printers. Given this understanding, the identified code span in `_print_Poly` is directly related to the issue since it deals with the LaTeX representation of a Poly object. Therefore, we select the span containing `_print_Poly` for further attention to correct the order of monomials.",
