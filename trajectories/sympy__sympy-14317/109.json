This discrepancy mainly concerns the order of monomials in the LaTeX output. The investigation started by examining the relevant code spans in the search results, focusing on how different printers handle Poly objects. The `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` method directly handles the LaTeX printing of a Poly object. It converts the polynomial expression into a LaTeX-formatted string, but it does not explicitly order the monomials in the same way as the 'str' and 'pretty' printers which order from highest to lowest degrees. This function uses `poly.as_expr()` to convert the polynomial to an expression, and it follows with printing this expression, without any specific ordering method applied. On the other hand, in the `Sympy/polys/rings.py` file, the `PolyElement._sorted` method is found, responsible for sorting monomials in a polynomial according to a specified order. This method might be utilized to ensure the correct monomial order in the LaTeX printer if integrated. This function could offer a solution by ordering monomials before they are converted into a LaTeX-formatted string, ensuring a consistent order with other printers. This method is not directly called in the `_print_Poly` method but could potentially be integrated to solve the issue.",
