The main focus should be on the LatexPrinter class and its _print_Poly method, as this is where the LaTeX printing logic resides. I also need to consider the PolyElement class, particularly its str method, since it defines how the Poly is represented as a string and might offer insights into the expected monomial order. Additionally, the _sorted method in PolyElement could be relevant if it affects the order in which monomials are processed. The key is to ensure that the LaTeX printing method aligns with the order used by the other printers. After examining the code, I identified the span for _print_Poly in LatexPrinter and the str method in PolyElement as directly relevant.
