The current file context and search results primarily point towards the 'LatexPrinter' class in 'latex.py' and the '_print_Poly' method in it. This method is responsible for converting a Poly object to its LaTeX representation. Upon analyzing the method, it is clear that the monomials are being joined in the order they are obtained from 'poly.as_expr()'. This method likely does not respect the order dictated by the polynomial's degree, leading to the observed discrepancy. Therefore, the span containing 'LatexPrinter._print_Poly' is identified as relevant to the reported issue, as it contains the code that needs to be adjusted to ensure the LaTeX output respects the polynomial's logical order of monomials.",
