Therefore, this code span is relevant to the issue because it directly handles the printing of polynomials in LaTeX format.

The key code span to focus on is `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class. This method constructs the LaTeX representation of a Poly object, but it does not sort the monomials in descending order of their degrees, which is the logical order expected. This discrepancy results in the `latex(p)` output not matching the order of `str(p)` and `pretty(p)`. To resolve this issue, the `_print_Poly` method would need to be modified to ensure that the monomials are sorted before being converted to LaTeX. Currently, the method takes the expression from `poly.as_expr()` and prints it as is, which results in the monomials being in the order they were initially constructed rather than sorted by degree. Thus, the identified relevant code span is the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class.",
