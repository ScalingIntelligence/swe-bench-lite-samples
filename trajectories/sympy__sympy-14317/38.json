By examining the provided search results, it's apparent that the problematic behavior is likely occurring within the '_print_Poly' method of the LatexPrinter class in 'sympy/printing/latex.py'. This method is responsible for converting the polynomial expression into its LaTeX representation. The method prints the polynomial expression by invoking 'poly.as_expr()', which might not preserve the original order of monomials. As a result, the LaTeX output does not match the logical order seen in the str and pretty representations.\n\nGiven the detailed context and the specific issue, the identified relevant code spans are focused around the '_print_Poly' method of the LatexPrinter class. This method is where the evaluation of the polynomial expression occurs and where adjustments would need to be made to rectify the monomial order issue.

I examined the `LatexPrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file and the `_print_Poly` method within it. This method constructs the LaTeX representation of a Poly object but does not explicitly sort the monomials in any particular order. In contrast, the `_print_Poly` method in the `StrPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/str.py` explicitly sorts and formats the terms, ensuring a consistent order. I identified that the key difference lies in how the terms are combined and formatted in each method. The LatexPrinter could benefit from a similar explicit sorting approach to align with the other printers. This analysis suggests that the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method needs an update to sort its terms in the correct order before formatting them into LaTeX.",
