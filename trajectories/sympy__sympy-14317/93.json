To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the printing of a Poly object in LaTeX format. The focus should be on the `LatexPrinter` class and its `_print_Poly` method in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file. This method is responsible for converting a Poly object into its LaTeX representation. Additionally, I should ensure that the order of monomials in the LaTeX output matches the logical order, similar to how it is handled in the str and pretty printers. The str printer's handling of Poly objects in `sympy/printing/str.py` can provide a reference for the correct order, particularly in the `_print_Poly` method of the `StrPrinter` class. Furthermore, understanding how monomials are sorted in the `PolyElement` class within `sympy/polys/rings.py` will be crucial, specifically the `_sorted` method which sorts monomials based on the specified order. By examining these relevant sections, I can determine how to adjust the LaTeX printer to maintain the correct order of monomials. Based on the provided search results, I will identify and extract the relevant code spans that directly impact the ordering and printing of Poly objects in LaTeX format.",

The str printer and possibly the pretty printer do sort the monomials as seen in the PolyElement's str method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py'.

However, the investigation into how sorting is handled in the str and pretty printers, and the potential replication or integration of a similar sorting mechanism in the LaTeX printer is relevant. The str printer's _print_Poly method in 'sympy/printing/str.py' sorts terms based on the coefficients and generators, which seems logical for string representation. Similarly, the PolyElement's str method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' sorts terms based on exponentials and coefficients. Both methods do not explicitly sort monomials in a descending order as per degrees, which might be related to the issue. The LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method does not seem to explicitly sort monomials based on degrees either, which could be the reason for the issue with LaTeX printing.

The str printer's _print_Poly method in 'sympy/printing/str.py' sorts terms based on the coefficients and generators, which seems logical for string representation. Similarly, the PolyElement's str method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' sorts terms based on exponentials and coefficients. Both methods do not explicitly sort monomials in a descending order as per degrees, which might be related to the issue. The LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method does not seem to explicitly sort monomials based on degrees either, which could be the reason for the issue with LaTeX printing.

However, the context provides insights into how monomials are handled in the str and LaTeX printers. The LaTeX printer's _print_Poly method does not explicitly sort monomials by degrees before generating the LaTeX output, which might explain the inconsistent ordering seen in the LaTeX output compared to the str output. The PolyElement's str method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' sorts terms based on coefficients and generators, but it does not explicitly sort monomials by degrees either. A thorough investigation of the pretty printer's implementation should reveal its sorting mechanism for monomials. Since the pretty printer is not provided in the context, we should search for its implementation and focus on methods related to printing Poly objects and handling the sorting of monomials.",
