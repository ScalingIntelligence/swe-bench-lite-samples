The str and pretty printers order monomials from highest to lowest degrees, but the latex printer does not follow this order. To solve this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the printing of Polys in LaTeX and ensure that they correctly order the monomials. From the search results, the relevant code spans are in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' where the _print_Poly method of the LatexPrinter class is defined. Specifically, the _print_Poly method constructs the LaTeX representation of the Poly object by calling the _print method on the expression obtained from poly.as_expr(), which might not preserve the monomial order. To fix the issue, the _print_Poly method should be modified to ensure it respects the monomial order as done in the str printer or similar methods.",

Following this, I analyzed the provided context in the LatexPrinter class, especially focusing on the _print_Poly method. In the new search results, I examined the StrPrinter class and PolyElement class for their respective handling of Poly objects. The StrPrinter._print_Poly method demonstrated how the string representation of the polynomial is constructed, emphasizing the direct relationship between coeff and exp. Additionally, the PolyElement class revealed how polynomials are sorted and represented as strings or LaTeX, providing more insight into how monomials are managed and ordered. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans include the _print_Poly methods in LatexPrinter and StrPrinter, and the methods in PolyElement related to sorting and string representation.",

The reported issue involves the LaTeX printer not using the same order of monomials as the str and pretty printers for Poly objects. Upon inspection of the LaTeX printer (_print_Poly method), it is observed that it directly converts the Poly to an expression without explicitly sorting the monomials, which could lead to the discrepancy. The str printer (_print_Poly method in 'sympy/printing/str.py') and the polynomial element's string representation method (str method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py') both appear to handle the order of monomials more explicitly, which is likely why they maintain the correct order from highest to lowest degrees.
