The relevant code spans to investigate are those related to the LaTeX printing of Poly objects. The LatexPrinter class in the 'latex.py' file contains the method _print_Poly which is responsible for converting a Poly object into its LaTeX representation. This method specifically handles the conversion of a Poly object to a LaTeX formatted string. The issue likely arises from how the monomials are ordered or concatenated within this method. The method _print_Poly calls poly.as_expr() to convert the Poly object into an expression form, and then it processes this expression to generate the LaTeX string. It is here that the order of monomials might not be preserved as the monomials are likely processed in the order they are returned by poly.as_expr(). This discrepancy in order could be the cause of the issue. Further investigation into how poly.as_expr() itself processes and returns the monomials might be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
