The key to identifying relevant code spans is to pinpoint where the LaTeX printer for the Poly object is defined and how it sorts the monomials when generating the LaTeX representation. From the search results, the 'LatexPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' is the primary suspect for the LaTeX printing issue. Specifically, the '_print_Poly' method in this class needs careful examination since it converts a Poly object into its LaTeX representation. It doesn't appear to handle the sorting of monomials explicitly, which could explain the discrepancy. Additionally, other parts of the codebase, such as the 'PolyElement' class in 'sympy/polys/rings.py', should be analyzed for comparison since they handle the string and pretty printing differently and might sort monomials correctly. This analysis will help in identifying if the current LaTeX printing lacks a sort feature and if so, determine where and how it should be implemented.",
