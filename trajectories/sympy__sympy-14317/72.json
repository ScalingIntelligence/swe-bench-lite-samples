The key focus is on the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class to identify if it correctly orders the monomials or not. The relevant code spans are those in LatexPrinter._print_Poly in latex.py, StrPrinter._print_Poly in str.py, and PrettyPrinter._print_Poly in pretty.py. The LatexPrinter._print_Poly method calls self._print(poly.as_expr()) and then constructs the LaTeX representation without explicitly sorting the monomials according to their degrees, which may cause the discrepancy. The str and pretty printers, however, explicitly sort the terms in the _print_Poly methods, which is why they provide the expected order. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are in latex.py, str.py, and pretty.py, specifically focusing on how each printer handles the polynomial's terms.",
