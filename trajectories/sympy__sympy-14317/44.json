The latex printer should align with the logical order of monomials, highest to lowest degrees. The current implementation of the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class does not seem to handle the ordering of monomials specifically. It directly converts the polynomial to an expression and prints it, which might be why the order is incorrect. Relevant code spans are those involved in converting the polynomial to an expression and rendering it in LaTeX format. The search results include the implementation of the str and pretty printers' handling of polynomials, which might be useful for reference on how to order the monomials. The `_print_Poly` methods in `StrPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes show how monomials are ordered in string and pretty formats respectively. Additionally, the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class should be modified to align with this ordering.

The str printer's '_print_Poly' method involves iterating through the terms of the polynomial and assembling them into a string, ensuring that monomials are appropriately structured with coefficients and generators. The pretty printer's '_print_Poly' method, although not directly provided in the context, likely employs similar logic to structure the visual representation, potentially using a set of symbols and formatting rules for a more readable output. From these observations, the LaTeX printer's '_print_Poly' method should be adjusted to similarly respect and order monomials according to their degrees, ensuring consistency across all printer formats.",
