Both the LaTeX and str printers need to be examined for their handling of Poly objects. The relevant sections in the file context and search results are the implementations of `_print_Poly` in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/str.py`. The str printer seems to correctly order the monomials from highest to lowest degrees, as shown by its handling of terms in the `_print_Poly` method. The LaTeX printer, however, directly prints the expression without considering the desired order, which is likely causing the mismatch in the order of monomials. To address the issue, the LaTeX printer's `_print_Poly` method should be modified to match the logical order of the monomials as done in the str printer. This involves adding sorting logic before generating the LaTeX string of the polynomial expression.",
