The LaTeX printer should ideally follow the same logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees, as done by the str and pretty printers. The provided search results include the LatexPrinter class in the sympy/printing/latex.py file, which is relevant to the LaTeX printing functionality. Among the code spans, the _print_Poly method within the LatexPrinter class is particularly relevant because it is directly responsible for printing Poly objects in LaTeX format. The method converts the polynomial into its LaTeX representation but it does not specify any sorting mechanism for the monomials. This omission is likely the cause of the discrepancy in monomial order between the LaTeX printer and the other printers. Based on this understanding, the _print_Poly method is identified as containing the relevant code span that needs to be addressed to resolve the issue.",

The current implementation of _print_Poly in LatexPrinter directly converts the polynomial to an expression and then prints it, which does not guarantee the order of monomials. This behavior contrasts with the str and pretty printers' approach of explicitly ordering the monomials from highest to lowest degrees. To resolve this issue, the _print_Poly method in LatexPrinter should be modified to order the monomials explicitly before printing, similar to the approach in StrPrinter and PrettyPrinter.

The relevant code spans to investigate this issue are primarily in the `LatexPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/latex.py`, specifically the `_print_Poly` method. This method is responsible for generating LaTeX representation of polynomials and does not explicitly sort the monomials before joining them. Comparing this with the `_print_Poly` method in `StrPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/str.py`, which sorts the terms before printing, indicates the discrepancy. The search results confirm the presence of these methods in their respective files, but sorting logic is absent in the LaTeX printer, making the identified spans relevant for addressing the issue. Additionally, the initialization of the `LatexPrinter` (`__init__` method) provides context on settings that might influence printing behavior. Overall, the identified code spans are directly related to the LaTeX printing of polynomials and should be adjusted to ensure consistent ordering with other printers.",
