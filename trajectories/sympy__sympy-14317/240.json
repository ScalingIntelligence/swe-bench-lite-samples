This difference in order between the LaTeX printer and other printers (like pretty and str) could affect the readability and coherence of the LaTeX output. The relevant code in the search results revolves around the `LatexPrinter` class, specifically in how it handles the printing of `Poly` objects. The method `_print_Poly` seems to be the key point of interest here. This method converts the `Poly` object into its LaTeX representation, but the issue suggests that the order of monomials in this representation does not match the expected order from other printers. Therefore, this method is directly linked to the reported issue. Since the current context does not identify any other relevant files or code spans, and the issue is clearly connected to the `_print_Poly` method within the `LatexPrinter` class, these are the relevant code spans we should focus on. This method's logic needs to be examined and potentially adjusted to ensure it respects the same order of monomials as the str and pretty printers.",
