Upon analyzing the provided search results, the relevant code is found in the `LatexPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/latex.py`. Specifically, the `_print_Poly` method is of primary interest, as it handles the conversion of a polynomial to its LaTeX representation. This method calls `poly.as_expr()` to convert the polynomial to its expression form, which is then printed. The order of the monomials in the resulting LaTeX string depends on the order of the terms in the expression obtained from `poly.as_expr()`.
