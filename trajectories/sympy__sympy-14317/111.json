The current LaTeX printer implementation in sympy/printing/latex.py (span id='LatexPrinter._print_Poly') directly prints the expression without any specific sorting or order specified for the monomials. This needs to be addressed to ensure consistency with the str and pretty printers. Based on the context provided, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the printing of Poly objects, particularly the _print_Poly method in both LatexPrinter and StrPrinter. Additionally, the sort_key and terms methods in PolyElement (sympy/polys/rings.py) are relevant as they determine the order of terms in a polynomial. The search results further confirm that the PrettyPrinter does sort the terms correctly, which can be used as a reference for implementing the correct order in the LatexPrinter. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans are from the _print_Poly methods in latex.py and str.py, and the sort_key and terms methods in PolyElement in rings.py.",
