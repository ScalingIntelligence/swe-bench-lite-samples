This discrepancy might be rooted in how the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class is defined. Upon examination, I noticed that the _print_Poly method directly converts the polynomial to an expression using `poly.as_expr()` and then prints it without any specific reordering. This suggests that the polynomial's natural (unsorted) order is being used in LaTeX printing, unlike the pretty and str printers. This method is a strong candidate for where the issue lies and where modifications should be made to align the LaTeX printing with logical monomial order. Therefore, the relevant code span is identified within the LatexPrinter class, specifically the _print_Poly method.",

This method prints the polynomial in a format that does not respect the order of monomials.\n\nIn the new search results, we have two other printers: StrPrinter and PrettyPrinter. The StrPrinter class contains a _print_Poly method that sorts the terms of the polynomial from highest to lowest degree. The PrettyPrinter class also sorts the terms in a similar manner. These methods can serve as a reference for how to sort the terms when implementing or modifying the LaTeX printer.\n\nBased on the analysis, I will focus on the LatexPrinter._print_Poly method for updating the LaTeX printing to match the str and pretty printing, and I will draw inspiration from the ways the str and pretty printers sort the monomials.",
