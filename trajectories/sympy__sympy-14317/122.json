I analyzed the search results to identify the relevant code spans related to the LaTeX, str, and pretty printers for Poly objects. In `sympy/printing/latex.py`, the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class constructs the LaTeX representation directly from the expression returned by `poly.as_expr()`. This method does not seem to apply any specific sorting of the monomials, which might lead to the observed inconsistent order. In `sympy/printing/str.py`, the `_print_Poly` method in the `StrPrinter` class handles the printing of Poly objects, explicitly sorting the terms in the polynomial. Similarly, in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, the `_print_Poly` method in the `PrettyPrinter` class handles the pretty printing of Poly objects with explicit term sorting logic, which suggests that this may be the reason for the observed difference. Based on this analysis, I will identify the relevant spans in the codebase that need to be reviewed or potentially modified to resolve the issue.",
