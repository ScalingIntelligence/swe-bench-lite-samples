The method currently converts the Poly object to an expression and then prints it, but it does not handle the order of monomials explicitly. This discrepancy in order could be due to how the `as_expr()` method translates the Poly object, which might need to be re-evaluated or potentially sorted before being passed to the LaTeX printer to ensure consistency with the other print methods.",

The str and pretty printers use a logical order from highest to lowest degrees, but the LaTeX printer does not.\n2. Reviewing the current file context: Relevant files include 'sympy/printing/latex.py', 'sympy/printing/str.py', and 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py'. The methods '_print_Poly' in these files print Poly objects, and their implementations seem to handle the order of monomials differently.\n3. Processing new search results:\n   a. In 'sympy/printing/str.py', the '_print_Poly' method sorts terms by their degrees before printing.\n   b. In 'sympy/printing/latex.py', the '_print_Poly' method does not explicitly sort terms by degrees; instead, it prints the expression directly.\n4. Evaluating relevance: Both methods in the search results are relevant to the issue because they handle the printing of Poly objects. However, the LaTeX printer method lacks the explicit term sorting found in the str and pretty printer methods.\n5. Decision: The LaTeX printer method in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' needs to be updated to sort the terms by degrees similarly to the str and pretty printer methods. This will ensure consistency in the order of monomials when printing using LaTeX.",

To ensure consistency among the printers, especially between str, pretty, and LaTeX, I searched for the method or function used in _print_Poly in both the StrPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes. In these classes, I found that _as_ordered_terms or default_sort_key is used to determine how monomials are ordered. This information is used to align or adapt the ordering in the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method to maintain consistency. However, the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method does not currently use these ordering methods, suggesting that the ordering of monomials is not consistent with the str and pretty printers.",
