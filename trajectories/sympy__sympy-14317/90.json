I analyzed the provided search results and found that both the LatexPrinter and StrPrinter classes have a method named _print_Poly which is responsible for printing Poly objects. The StrPrinter's _print_Poly method seems to handle the order of monomials correctly, iterating over the terms and appending them to a list, which maintains the logical order from highest to lowest degrees. However, the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method does not currently handle the order of monomials directly; instead, it converts the Poly object to its expression form and prints that, which might not maintain the order. This discrepancy suggests that modifying LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method to handle the order of monomials explicitly, similar to StrPrinter's approach, could resolve the issue. Given this analysis, the most relevant code span is in \"_print_Poly\" method of the LatexPrinter class.",

This method converts a Poly object into its LaTeX representation. It first prints the expression part of the polynomial, then the generators, and finally the domain. The printing of the expression part is delegated to another method, _print, which likely handles the details of the expression representation. Notably, the order of monomials is not explicitly controlled or sorted within this method. To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the _print method, when called with poly.as_expr(), respects the same monomial order as the str and pretty printers. To do this, we should investigate the _print_Add and _print_Mul methods in the LatexPrinter class since these are likely to be invoked when processing poly.as_expr(). Additionally, comparing this implementation with those in str.py and pretty.py will help identify where the discrepancy arises and how it should be corrected.",

This discrepancy is apparent in the terms being printed. From the search results and the provided code, it is evident that the LaTeX printer's method for handling polynomials lacks the specific ordering logic present in the str and pretty methods. Specifically, the '_print_Poly' method in the LatexPrinter class directly converts the polynomial to an expression and prints it without explicitly ordering the monomials. This absence of order manipulation directly correlates with the issue described. Therefore, the relevant code spans that need attention are those within the '_print_Poly' method and possibly '_print_Add' if it also relates to how terms are combined and sorted for LaTeX output. These areas are critical for addressing the discrepancy in monomial order between the LaTeX printer and other printers.",
