When printing a Poly, the str and pretty printers use the logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees, but the LaTeX printer does not. This discrepancy is evident from the provided example where the LaTeX output has the monomials in a different order compared to the str and pretty outputs. The relevant code spans are identified in the LatexPrinter class, particularly in the _print_Poly method, which is responsible for generating LaTeX output for Poly objects. The method currently constructs the LaTeX representation by converting the Poly to its expression form and joining it with other components. There is no specific sorting or ordering logic applied within this method, which is likely the cause of the issue. To resolve the issue, the _print_Poly method should include logic to sort the monomials from highest to lowest degree before generating the LaTeX output. Since the Poly class already maintains the monomials in a specific order, this ordering should ideally be respected in the LaTeX output as well. Therefore, modifying the _print_Poly method to use this order would align the LaTeX output with the expected behavior from the str and pretty printers.",
