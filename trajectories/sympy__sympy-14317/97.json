This discrepancy arises from the fact that the LaTeX printer sorts monomials differently. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans responsible for the monomial sorting and printing in both the LaTeX printer and the PolyElement class. From the provided search results, the 'LatexPrinter._print_Poly' method is responsible for printing the Poly in LaTeX format, but it seems to directly convert the Poly to an expression without explicitly controlling the monomial order. In contrast, the 'PolyElement.terms' method sorts the monomials using the '_sorted' method, which uses the order specified or the default ring order. Therefore, the solution likely involves modifying the 'LatexPrinter._print_Poly' method to ensure it respects the same monomial order as used by the pretty and str printers. The relevant code spans are the 'LatexPrinter._print_Poly' method and possibly the 'PolyElement.terms' method (and its '_sorted' component) for context on how monomial order is managed.",

This suggests that the issue lies in the `_print_Poly` method of the `LatexPrinter` class. The current implementation in `_print_Poly` does not explicitly sort the monomials before formatting them for LaTeX output, which is likely the cause of the discrepancy. By identifying and sorting the monomials in the same order as the str and pretty printers within the `_print_Poly` method, the issue can be resolved. The provided search results confirm the presence of the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class, making it the primary target for modification.
