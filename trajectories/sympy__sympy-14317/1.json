The relevant part of the codebase is within the LatexPrinter class, specifically the _print_Poly method. This method is responsible for converting a Poly object into its LaTeX representation. A key observation is that it uses poly.as_expr() to convert the Poly to an expression before printing, but it does not ensure that the monomials are in the correct order. This is likely the root cause of the issue, as the order of monomials in the expression might differ from the logical order of the Poly itself. To resolve this issue, the _print_Poly method should be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that the printing order matches the expected logical order.",
