The focus should be on the LatexPrinter class and its method for printing a Poly object. The relevant method is _print_Poly in the LatexPrinter class, which directly handles the LaTeX representation of a Poly. This method uses poly.as_expr() to create the expression but does not explicitly reorder the monomials as per the degree. Additionally, the PolyElement class contains methods for sorting and ordering terms, which could influence the order seen in other printers like str and pretty but do not appear to be utilized in the LaTeX printer.\n\nFor the LaTeX printer to match the behavior of str and pretty, it needs to consider the order of monomials by their degrees. The current _print_Poly method does not do this explicitly, potentially leading to the observed discrepancy. Therefore, the relevant spans to be extracted should be those that deal with the LaTeX printing of a Poly object, especially the _print_Poly method in sympy/printing/latex.py, and any methods in sympy/polys/rings.py that handle monomial sorting and term order, which might be relevant for fixing the monomial order in LaTeX output.",
