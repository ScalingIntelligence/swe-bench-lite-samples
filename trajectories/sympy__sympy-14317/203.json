Upon examining the search results, we see that the StrPrinter also has a _print_Poly method, which might offer clues on how the order is managed in the str printer. The _print_Poly method in the StrPrinter class processes the monomials and their coefficients in a specific order, which could be directly referenced or adapted for the LatexPrinter to ensure consistency in the order of monomials across different printers.
