The method converts the Poly object to an expression and then prints it with the appropriate LaTeX formatting. The key part to focus on is the line `expr = self._print(poly.as_expr())`, which indicates that it uses the expression's string representation directly for the LaTeX output. This might be the reason why the order of monomials is different from what is expected since `poly.as_expr()` might not maintain the same monomial order as the Poly object.

Specifically, the _print_Poly method in this class is responsible for generating LaTeX output for Poly objects, but it does not currently sort the monomials in the expected order. The current implementation directly prints the polynomial expression without any specific sorting applied. To resolve this issue, the _print_Poly method should be updated to sort the monomials as per the logical order of degrees, similar to how it's done in the pretty and str printers. The PolyElement class in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' can also be referenced for the expected order logic, particularly the sort_key method which is used for comparing monomials.
