Both str and pretty printers use the logical order from highest to lowest degrees, but the LaTeX printer does not. From the given context, the relevant file appears to be `sympy/printing/latex.py`, which contains the `LatexPrinter` class with a method `_print_Poly`. This method likely needs to be adjusted to match the monomial order with that used by the str and pretty printers. Another relevant file might be `sympy/polys/rings.py`, where the `PolyElement` class and its sorting method `_sorted` could influence the monomial order. Lastly, `sympy/interactive/printing.py` might also be relevant for initializing printing settings that could affect the rendering of Poly objects.",

The relevant function to address this issue is `LatexPrinter._print_Poly`. This function is responsible for converting a Poly object to its LaTeX representation. A comparison of the code spans in `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` and the behavior described in the issue suggests that the sorting logic for monomials might be missing or incorrect in the LaTeX printer. This discrepancy could be due to the way monomials are sorted leading to a different ordering than expected in the LaTeX output. To resolve this, it would be necessary to align the sorting logic in `_print_Poly` with that used in the str and pretty printers. No other functions seem directly relevant to this specific issue as they do not involve the direct conversion of Poly objects to LaTeX and their sorting methods.",

From the provided context, it is evident that the LatexPrinter class in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' is responsible for rendering LaTeX representations of SymPy objects, including Poly objects. The _print_Poly method in this class converts a Poly object into its LaTeX representation by printing its expression and generators. However, the current implementation does not explicitly sort the monomials of the polynomial according to the specified order.\n\nIn the search results, the 'sympy/polys/rings.py' file contains several relevant sections of code. Specifically, the PolyElement class methods like 'sort_key', '_cmp', 'terms', and '_sorted' are crucial as they determine the order of terms in a polynomial. The 'terms' method in particular uses the '_sorted' method, which sorts the terms based on a specified order or the default ring order.\n\nBased on this analysis, to fix the issue with the LaTeX printer, it is necessary to ensure that the terms of the Poly object are sorted correctly before being converted to LaTeX. This involves modifying the _print_Poly method to explicitly sort the terms using the same logic as in the PolyElement class.\n\nThe relevant code spans are identified in the 'sympy/printing/latex.py' file (specifically the _print_Poly method) and in the 'sympy/polys/rings.py' file (specifically the methods sort_key, _cmp, terms, and _sorted).

This suggests that the order discrepancy might not be directly handled within `_print_Poly` itself but rather might be associated with how `as_expr()` or the internal structures of `Poly` or `PolyElement` encode the monomial order. Therefore, further investigation in `sympy/polys/rings.py` regarding the `PolyElement` class and its sorting method `_sorted` is key, as this class might contain the logic deciding the monomial order. Additionally, `sympy/interactive/printing.py` should be checked for settings that initialize or affect printing styles, which could indirectly influence how monomial order is perceived across different printers.

In latex.py, the LatexPrinter class is responsible for LaTeX printing, and specifically the _print_Poly method does not seem to perform any additional sorting of the monomials beyond what is done by poly.as_expr(). In rings.py, the PolyElement class contains methods related to sorting and ordering monomials, such as sort_key, terms, and _sorted. The search results also show several comparison methods (__lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__) in PolyElement that could be relevant for ensuring the correct order during LaTeX printing. The issue could be fixed by ensuring that the LatexPrinter._print_Poly method respects the order returned by methods like PolyElement.terms() when generating LaTeX code for Poly objects. The init_printing function in sympy/interactive/printing.py is also identified as relevant, as it initializes printing settings that could potentially influence how polynomials are printed in different contexts.",
