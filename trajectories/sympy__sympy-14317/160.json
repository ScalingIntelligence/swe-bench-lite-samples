This discrepancy in order affects the readability and consistency of the output across different printing methods. From the search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans can be found in the 'LatexPrinter' class within 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and the 'PolyElement' class within 'sympy/polys/rings.py'. The '_print_Poly' method in 'LatexPrinter' is responsible for converting a Poly object to its LaTeX representation. However, the way it constructs the LaTeX string from the polynomial expression does not seem to consider the logical order of monomials, leading to the observed discrepancy. The 'PolyElement.str' method, on the other hand, does order the monomials correctly. The solution to the issue may involve modifying the '_print_Poly' method to ensure that the conversion to LaTeX respects the logical order of monomials, similar to how it's done in the str and pretty printers.",
