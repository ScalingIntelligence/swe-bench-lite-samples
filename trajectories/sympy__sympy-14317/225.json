The key element to focus on is the order of monomials in the LaTeX printing of a Poly. From the search results, the most relevant code span is the `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. This method is responsible for converting the polynomial into its LaTeX representation. The current implementation of `_print_Poly` does not explicitly sort the monomials, which could be the reason for the discrepancy in order between the LaTeX printer and the other printers. This suggests that adding a sorting mechanism for the monomials in `_print_Poly` might resolve the issue. Therefore, the identified relevant code span is the `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` method, as it directly involves the LaTeX printing of the polynomial.",
