The LaTeX printer does not maintain the same order as the other printers, which is evident from the provided example. To resolve this, we need to identify where the LaTeX printer is generating the ordering for the monomials and ensure it aligns with the logical order used in the str and pretty printers. By examining the provided search results, we can see the relevant code spans in the 'LatexPrinter' class, particularly the '_print_Poly' method. This method generates the LaTeX representation for a Poly object, but it seems to lack the specific ordering logic found in the 'StrPrinter' class. There is also a mention of the 'PolyElement' class, which might be relevant for understanding the ordering of terms. Based on this analysis, the identified spans focus on the '_print_Poly' methods in both 'LatexPrinter' and 'StrPrinter' classes, as well as the 'PolyElement' class where the terms are possibly sorted and processed differently for str and LaTeX output.",

The `StrPrinter`'s `_print_Poly` method, on the other hand, explicitly handles each term and prints them in an ordered manner. Additionally, the `PolyElement` class in `rings.py` includes a `str` method that sorts terms via the `sorted` function, which influences the order of monomials in the output as seen in the `StrPrinter`.
