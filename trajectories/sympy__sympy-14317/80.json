The LaTeX printer does not follow the same ordering as the str and pretty printers. This issue is specifically related to the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class. Additionally, the str method in the PolyElement class is relevant as it provides the logical order of monomials for str and pretty printers. Comparing the existing PolyElement.str method with the LatexPrinter._print_Poly method, it is evident that the LaTeX printer is missing the logic to order monomials from highest to lowest degrees like the str method does. To address this, the _print_Poly method should be updated to include the logic for sorting monomials from the PolyElement.str method. The search results confirm that the relevant sections of code are present in the provided context, and no further search is needed as the necessary code spans are already identified.",
