This method currently converts the Poly object to an expression using `poly.as_expr()` and then prints it. The order of monomials in `poly.as_expr()` is determined by the poly's internal ordering, not by the `as_expr()` method itself. Therefore, we will need to manually sort the terms of the expression according to the poly's internal order before converting it to LaTeX representation. We can achieve this by directly accessing the terms of the poly and printing them in the correct order.",
