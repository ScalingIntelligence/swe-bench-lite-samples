The key elements to focus on are the methods responsible for printing Poly objects in the LaTeX, str, and potentially pretty printers. The search results include the implementation of _print_Poly in the LatexPrinter and StrPrinter classes, which are crucial for this task. The LatexPrinter._print_Poly method directly deals with the conversion of Poly objects to LaTeX, and it does not appear to explicitly order the monomials in a specific sequence, which could be the root cause of the issue. On the other hand, StrPrinter._print_Poly seems to handle the order of monomials properly for string representation. Additionally, the search results include orderings from sympy.polys.orderings which might influence how monomials are ordered and could be a point of reference or correction in the LatexPrinter._print_Poly method.

The str and pretty printers maintain the logical order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees, whereas the LaTeX printer does not. From the provided context, the relevant part of the LaTeX printer is the `_print_Poly` method, which constructs the LaTeX representation of the polynomial but does not sort the monomials. Comparing this with the `_print_Poly` method in the str printer, it's clear that the str printer sorts the monomials correctly, indicating the issue lies within the LaTeX printer's method. The search results for the str printer confirm that the str printer sorts the monomials as expected. The task is now to ensure the LaTeX printer's `_print_Poly` method sorts the monomials as the str printer does.",

The key task is to identify and adjust the code responsible for printing Poly objects in LaTeX format to ensure it follows the same order as the other printers. From the provided file context, the relevant code spans are identified. The LatexPrinter class is responsible for LaTeX printing, and specifically the _print_Poly method is where the sorting order needs to be adjusted. The _print_Poly method currently prints the expression directly without specifying an order, which likely results in a different order compared to the pretty and str printers. To address this, I need to ensure that the monomials are sorted according to the same logic used in the pretty and str printers. This involves likely modifying the _print_Poly method to sort the monomials before generating the LaTeX output. The pretty.py file also provides context on how the pretty printer sorts monomials in its _print_Add method, suggesting that the LaTeX printer should likely implement similar sorting logic. Additionally, the search results from rings.py and orderings.py provide further context on how monomials are sorted in the PolyElement class and the different monomial orders available. This suggests that the _print_Poly method needs to use a specific order when sorting monomials for LaTeX output.",
