This discrepancy needs to be investigated specifically in the LaTeX printer for Poly, and possibly in the PolyElement class if it affects monomial sorting.

The `str` and `pretty` printers maintain a logical order from highest to lowest degrees, while the LaTeX printer does not. This suggests that the `_print_Poly` method in the `LatexPrinter` class might not be respecting this order. To address this, I need to find relevant code spans that might handle the sorting or representation of monomials in the LaTeX printer. The `PolyElement` class in `sympy/polys/rings.py` contains methods related to sorting and comparing polynomial elements, such as `sort_key`, `_cmp`, and `_sorted`, which could be relevant if the LaTeX printer is not correctly utilizing these for ordering the monomials. Additionally, the `MonomialOrder` class in `sympy/polys/orderings.py` and its subclasses (`LexOrder`, `GradedLexOrder`, `ReversedGradedLexOrder`) define different monomial ordering strategies, which might be used by the LaTeX printer to ensure the correct order of monomials.",

The LaTeX printer specifically mentions the need to print polynomials through the _print_Poly method, which prints polynomials in a format that appears to be based on the polynomial's 'as_expr' method rather than sorted by degree. Additionally, the PolyElement class in rings.py involves methods for sorting monomials such as sort_key and _sorted, which could potentially impact how monomials are ordered in LaTeX output. The orderings.py file defines various monomial orderings like 'lex', 'grlex', and 'grevlex', which PolyElement might use to sort monomials. However, the current LaTeX printer implementation does not appear to use these sorting methods explicitly for printing, suggesting an inconsistency in monomial order between standard and LaTeX representations.

Comparing the output of the LaTeX printer with the str and pretty printers, it's observed that the LaTeX printer does not sort the monomials in the expected descending order of degrees. This suggests that the _print_Poly method in LatexPrinter should be modified to ensure the monomials are sorted correctly before being converted to LaTeX format. I examined the existing code for _print_Poly and found that it indeed does not specify any sorting order for the monomials. This is the code span that is most relevant and should be adapted to address the issue. Additionally, the context from sympy/polys/rings.py indicates the presence of sorting methods that could potentially be integrated or referenced in the _print_Poly method to ensure proper sorting of the monomials. Similarly, in sympy/polys/orderings.py, various monomial orderings are defined which could be used to specify the desired order for the monomials in the LaTeX output. Given these observations, modifying _print_Poly in sympy/printing/latex.py to include the appropriate sorting logic using elements from both sympy/polys/rings.py and sympy/polys/orderings.py is the primary task to address the reported issue.",
