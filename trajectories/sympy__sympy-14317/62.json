The search results provided include the LatexPrinter class and its methods. Specifically, the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class is relevant because it handles the LaTeX printing of Poly objects. The issue seems to be related to the order of terms in the printed Poly expression. The method _print_Poly converts the Poly object to its expression form and then prints it, but it doesn't seem to handle the order of monomials as described. This indicates that the method might need adjustments to ensure the LaTeX printer follows the same order as the str and pretty printers. Based on this analysis, the span 'LatexPrinter._print_Poly' is identified as relevant to address the reported issue.",

From the provided context, the LatexPrinter class has a method _print_Poly that converts a Poly object to LaTeX. This method calls _print on the poly's as_expr() result, suggesting that the order of monomials in as_expr() might be different from what's expected in LaTeX. Looking at the search results, the Poly class and its method as_expr are crucial for understanding the order of monomials. Also relevant is the PolyElement class which has methods like iterterms() and as_expr_dict() that might determine the order of monomials. However, the order of monomials in LaTeX might be influenced by the underlying data structure or how terms are iterated over or constructed in these methods. The spans 'PolyElement.as_expr', 'Poly.as_expr', and 'LatexPrinter._print_Poly' seem particularly relevant, as they deal with the conversion of Polys to expressions, which is central to the issue.",

However, the `_print_Poly` method of the `LatexPrinter` class, responsible for the LaTeX representation of Poly objects, appears to handle the sorting of terms directly when it converts the polynomial into an expression. This suggests an examination of the `_print_Poly` method to ensure it handles the ordering of terms correctly, possibly by applying an appropriate sorting mechanism on the terms returned by `as_expr()`, taking care to match the order produced by the str and pretty printers. Further investigation into additional methods or helper functions related to term sorting within the PolyElement class or its associated methods may provide deeper insights into how monomial ordering is determined or can be tweaked to address the discrepancy observed in the LaTeX printer.",

This discrepancy suggests a problem in the LaTeX printer's handling of monomial order. The current file context includes relevant code spans in both latex.py and polytools.py, but the LaTeX printer's method for handling Poly objects (_print_Poly) does not currently account for the order of monomials. The search results confirm that the _print_Poly method directly converts the Poly object to an expression using as_expr() and then constructs the LaTeX representation, but it does not sort the monomials. Therefore, modifying _print_Poly to sort monomials before constructing the LaTeX string is necessary to address the issue. This task is not complete as the proposed solution (ordering monomials) has not been implemented in the identified code span. Further action requires modifying the _print_Poly method to integrate monomial ordering.",

The issue is specifically related to the order of monomials in the LaTeX representation of a Poly object. Upon examining the provided context, it is evident that the problem involves the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class, which directly calls poly.as_expr() without considering the monomial order. This demonstrates that there is a need to check the handling of expression term ordering in the _print_Poly method. The Poly class includes methods for converting polynomials to expressions and handling coefficients and terms, all of which may contribute to the correct sorting and display of these terms. However, the file context provided does not reveal any specific sorting logic applied within the LatexPrinter for the terms of the Poly object beyond its conversion to an expression. This suggests a potential gap in the code context relevant to directly addressing the issue of monomial order in LaTeX printing.",
