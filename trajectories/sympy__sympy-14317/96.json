The LaTeX printer does not use the expected order of monomials from highest to lowest degrees, unlike the str and pretty printers. To address this, we need to investigate the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class within sympy/printing/latex.py. If the problem lies in the LatexPrinter's methodology for rendering polynomials, this is where the fix is likely to be. Additionally, checking the PolyElement class and its methods in sympy/polys/rings.py might provide insight into how polynomials are structured and thus how they should be printed in LaTeX.",

The LaTeX printer does not maintain the logical order from highest to lowest degrees as the other printers do.

The relevant parts of the code to investigate are the LatexPrinter class and its _print_Poly method, as well as the PolyElement class which might be responsible for how the terms are ordered or presented. The str method in PolyElement could also be relevant as it directly impacts the string representation of the Poly object.
