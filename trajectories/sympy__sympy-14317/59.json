It seems that the method directly calls _print on the expression obtained from poly.as_expr() without any specific reordering, which might be a reason for the discrepancy in the order.

From the provided code, it's clear that the StrPrinter and LatexPrinter handle Poly objects differently concerning the order of monomials. Specifically, the StrPrinter's _print_Poly method seems to correctly order monomials from highest to lowest degrees, as described. However, the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method simply prints the monomials in the order they are received from poly.as_expr(), which may not follow the intended order. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method to ensure it orders monomials similarly to the StrPrinter. Additionally, the provided StrPrinter code snippet confirms the expected order of monomials as highest to lowest degrees, providing a clear standard for the LatexPrinter to follow in any necessary adjustments. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue, focusing on the handling of Poly objects in the LatexPrinter class.",
