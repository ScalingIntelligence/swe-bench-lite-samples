This discrepancy is a result of the LaTeX printer ordering the monomials differently from the logical order used by the other printers. The relevant code spans identified are in the LatexPrinter class within the sympy/printing/latex.py file. Specifically, the _print_Poly method of the LatexPrinter class is responsible for converting a Poly object to its LaTeX representation. The method directly prints the expression without ensuring the monomial order aligns with the logical order used in other printers. Additionally, the PolyElement class in sympy/polys/rings.py contains methods related to converting a Poly object to a string with the correct order, which provides a basis for understanding how the order is managed in other contexts. The MonomialOrder classes in sympy/polys/orderings.py define various monomial orderings, but their usage in the LaTeX printer is not apparent in the provided code spans. Given this information, the relevant code span to address the reported issue is the _print_Poly method in the LatexPrinter class, as it directly deals with the conversion to LaTeX format and needs to be adjusted to respect the logical monomial order.",

Considering the 'as_expr()' method's role in converting polynomial elements into expressions and its potential impact on the LaTeX printer's output, it is crucial to inspect both its implementation and the settings influencing monomial order in LaTeX printing. Additionally, understanding how these order settings interact with the LaTeX printer's default settings (such as 'order' in the LatexPrinter class) is essential for resolving the discrepancy in monomial order between the LaTeX printer and other printers.",

The current LaTeX printer implementation does not explicitly control the order of monomials when converting a Poly object to LaTeX format. The relevant part of the LaTeX printer is the `_print_Poly` method, which converts the polynomial to its expression form and then prints it. To address the issue, one would need to ensure that the monomials in the `as_expr()` method of the Poly object are ordered correctly before conversion to LaTeX. The provided search results include different monomial orderings such as Lex, Graded Lex, and Reversed Graded Lex orders, which could be used in the `_print_Poly` method to ensure the correct ordering is followed. Understanding how these orders are applied and integrated into the `_print_Poly` method is crucial for resolving the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans from the search results are those related to the different monomial orderings and how they are instantiated.",
