However, we can infer from the other provided methods (_print_Poly in LatexPrinter and StrPrinter) that the PrettyPrinter likely follows a similar pattern in its handling of polynomials. The _print_Poly method in StrPrinter, for example, iterates over the terms of the polynomial and constructs a string representation while maintaining the order of terms as provided by the polynomial's terms() method. Given this, we can hypothesize that the PrettyPrinter might be handling the ordering similarly by respecting the order provided by the polynomial's internal structure or by an explicit ordering mechanism if present. Without the exact code of PrettyPrinter, this is an educated guess, but it suggests that the LatexPrinter's _print_Poly method could benefit from explicitly sorting or respecting an order parameter like StrPrinter and possibly PrettyPrinter do. Adding an explicit sorting step based on degree or using an order parameter unchanged from the input polynomial could align LatexPrinter with the behavior of StrPrinter and PrettyPrinter, providing consistent monomial ordering across different printing methods.",

I will now examine the current file context to understand already identified relevant files. The files 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/printing/str.py' are provided with the methods '_print_Poly' in each file. These are relevant because they are responsible for converting Poly objects to LaTeX and string formats respectively. Next, I will analyze the new search results to identify any additional relevant code spans. The new search results include 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' which contains methods for rendering Poly objects in pretty format. I will check the '_print_Poly' method in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/printing/str.py' to see if they correctly order monomials, and compare with 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' to ensure consistency. I have identified that the '_print_Poly' method in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' does not sort monomials before printing them, which is likely the cause of the issue.
