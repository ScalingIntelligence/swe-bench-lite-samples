There's no specific ordering logic applied here, which might be causing the discrepancy observed in the output order of monomials compared to the str and pretty printers. To resolve this issue, it might be necessary to modify the `_print_Poly` method to incorporate order handling logic similar to what is used in the str and pretty printers. Specifically, one could consider sorting the terms of the polynomial before printing them to ensure consistency with the other printers. This adjustment would involve understanding and applying the correct ordering (from highest to lowest degree) in the LaTeX output.

The issue at hand involves the order of monomials in LaTeX output for polynomials, which is not aligning with the order used in other printers like str and pretty. This discrepancy suggests that the '_print_Poly' method is not sorting the monomials in the desired sequence before generating the LaTeX output. To make significant progress, we need to identify how monomials are sorted in the str and pretty printers, particularly within their respective '_print_Poly' methods. These methods likely utilize some sorting mechanism or order settings that ensure the monomials are listed from highest to lowest degree. We should therefore search for the implementation of '_print_Poly' in the str and pretty printers, focusing on any sorting or order-related logic that might be used to maintain the sequence. This information will allow us to properly update the '_print_Poly' method in the LatexPrinter class to mimic this behavior, thus resolving the discrepancy in monomial order across different printing methods. Additionally, it might be prudent to study how the Poly class handles its sorting order to better understand how it should be applied in the LaTeX printer context.",

In the given search results, we see the `_print_Poly` method in both `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/str.py`. The `_print_Poly` method in `StrPrinter` correctly orders the monomials, so it can be used as a reference for fixing the order in `LatexPrinter`. Specifically, the `expr.terms()` method in `StrPrinter` iterates over terms in the correct order, and similar functionality should be implemented in `LatexPrinter` to ensure the order of terms matches across different printers. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that define the `_print_Poly` method in both `LatexPrinter` and `StrPrinter`.",

The StrPrinter's '_print_Poly' method appears to handle the printing of polynomials by iterating through terms and monomials, while the LatexPrinter's '_print_Poly' method directly converts the polynomial to an expression and prints it without explicit sorting of terms based on degrees. This discrepancy in handling likely leads to the reported issue of monomial order inconsistencies between the LaTeX and other printers. While the file context provides the relevant methods, the LatexPrinter's method lacks the sorting logic present in the StrPrinter's method. Further investigation into how the PrettyPrinter handles polynomial printing is needed to understand the full scope of the sorting mechanism for monomials.",
