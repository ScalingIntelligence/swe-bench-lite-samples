This method is responsible for constructing the argument list for the psql command. The current implementation initially constructs an argument list with options like user, host, and port, and then appends the database name at the end followed by any additional parameters provided. This order needs to be adjusted to meet the requirement that all options precede the database name.

This method already includes handling for various PostgreSQL-specific options and places the database name at the end of the arguments list. This method is relevant to the issue of proper argument ordering as it directly impacts how the psql command is invoked. However, looking closely, it is observed that the addition of 'parameters' (which can include the additional command-line options like '-c') is appended after the database name. This behavior aligns with the issue description, implying that the correction needed is to ensure these parameters come before the database name. The file context thus captures the essential part of addressing the reported issue, but adjustments within this method might be required.",
