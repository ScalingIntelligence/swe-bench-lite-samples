In the provided code snippet from 'django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py', the 'settings_to_cmd_args_env' method is responsible for constructing these arguments, including both the options and the database name ('dbname'), which should ideally be positioned last in the argument list according to psql's expected input. This specifically needs to accommodate any additional parameters passed by the user, which were found to be neglected in the current order of the 'args.extend(parameters)' line, likely causing the issue. Given the context of the reported issue, focusing on this method to ensure all parameters, including those from the user, are inserted at the correct position (before the database name) should solve the problem.
