The search results provided include relevant sections of the `astropy/wcs/wcs.py` file, which contains the `WCS` class with methods `__init__`, `_array_converter`, and `wcs_pix2world`. These methods are central to the functionality described in the issue. Particularly, the `_array_converter` method is used by `wcs_pix2world` to handle array transformations, and it appears to include logic for handling input arrays, including possible edge cases with empty arrays. Identifying the relevant spans in these methods will help in understanding how empty arrays are handled and how potential errors might be occurring or could be addressed. The spans identified include the initialization of the `WCS` object (`WCS.__init__`), the array conversion utility (`WCS._array_converter`), and the main transformation method (`WCS.wcs_pix2world`). By analyzing these sections, we can deduce whether the code already attempts to handle empty arrays and determine if additional safeguards or modifications are necessary.",
