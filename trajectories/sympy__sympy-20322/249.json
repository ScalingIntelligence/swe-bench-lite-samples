Specifically, it describes how in different versions of sympy, the behavior changes based on the evaluate parameter. A key goal is to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the evaluate parameter value. To address this, it's important to look at the implementations of sympify, simplify, and ceiling functions to understand how they interact and how the behavior differs based on the evaluate parameter. From the search results, several relevant code spans can be identified: 1. The ceiling function definition in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py, which includes the Ceiling class and its attributes. 2. The sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py, including how it handles different values of the evaluate parameter. 3. The simplify method in various modules such as Basic class in sympy/core/basic.py, Vector class in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py, etc., which shows how different classes implement their simplification logic. 4. The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py, which is a central function used by many classes to simplify expressions. These code spans collectively provide insight into how sympify, simplify, and ceiling interact and determine the behavior in question. By examining these, we can understand the conditions under which the behavior is affected and potentially identify the cause of the inconsistency.",

Specifically, the issue centers on how sympify and simplify handle expressions involving ceiling when the evaluate flag is set to False. The key elements from the issue are the expressions containing ceiling and the evaluate parameter in sympify. Given the file context, we have already identified relevant spans in the sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py and sympy/core/sympify.py files. In the new search results, we find additional relevant spans in sympy/simplify/simplify.py, particularly the 'simplify' function which is critical for the simplification process mentioned in the issue. These spans include the implementation of the simplify function and the usage of the ceiling function within it, which directly relate to the reported issue. Therefore, these new spans are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
