Specifically, the issue is with the expression '4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', which behaves differently when 'evaluate=False' versus 'evaluate=True'. From the search results, it's evident that both 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions are involved in the processing of this expression. The 'sympify' function converts the input expression to a SymPy object, and the 'simplify' function attempts to simplify this object. The 'ceiling' function is a key component here, and its handling in these functions might be causing the inconsistency. The 'sympify' function has separate logic for handling expressions based on the 'evaluate' flag, and this logic might not be fully synchronized with the 'simplify' function's logic, leading to the observed inconsistencies. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that involve the 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions as well as those that define or handle the 'ceiling' function.",
