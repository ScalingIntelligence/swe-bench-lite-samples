The issue specifically points out differences in behavior between sympy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2 when `evaluate` is set to `False`.

The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` which is involved in converting expressions to SymPy objects, especially with the argument `evaluate`.\n2. The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` which includes logic for simplifying expressions and is likely related to the differences observed in the behavior of `ceiling`.\n3. The `ceiling` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` which includes methods like `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, `_eval_rewrite_as_frac`, `_eval_is_nonpositive`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, and `__ge__`, showing the different operations related to the ceiling function.\n\nGiven these findings, it is plausible that the behavior discrepancy could be investigated or resolved within these areas of the codebase.

To address this, we need to ensure that the simplification process treats the expression consistently, independent of the `evaluate` parameter.
