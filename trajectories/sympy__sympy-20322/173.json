The issue seems to stem from differences in how these functions operate when `evaluate` is set to `True` or `False`. To ensure consistent behavior, we need to investigate the relevant code spans in the provided search results that handle these functions. From the search results, the key spans to investigate are those that define the `ceiling` function, the `sympify` function, and the `simplify` method across different classes. This includes spans like 'ceiling' in 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py', 'sympify' in 'sympy/core/sympify.py', and various 'simplify' methods in different files like 'sympy/core/basic.py', 'sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py', 'sympy/logic/boolalg.py', etc. Each of these spans may contain the logic that contributes to the inconsistent behavior observed. By examining these, we can better understand the issue and determine if the search task is complete.",
