Specifically, the issue arises when `evaluate` is set to `False`. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior across versions. To address this, the relevant code spans were identified in the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which handles the conversion of non-SymPy objects to SymPy objects, and determines whether to evaluate the expression based on the `evaluate` parameter. Additionally, the `ceiling` class and its methods were examined in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, focusing on how `ceiling` behaves in different contexts. Finally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` was reviewed to understand how simplification operations handle expressions with `ceiling`. These code spans are crucial for understanding the behavior of the functions and can be used to implement necessary changes to ensure consistent behavior.",
