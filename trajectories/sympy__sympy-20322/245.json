Given the constraints, it's best to focus on the critical issue of undefined variables and missing import statements, which are easier to pinpoint. The return statements outside of function bodies and the need to define all variables before use are secondary but could require significant restructuring of the code, which might be impractical in a limited token scenario. Thus, concentrating on the 'expr' variable and its usage until the first return statement seems most feasible.",
