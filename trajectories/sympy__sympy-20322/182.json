To address this, it is crucial to identify the code spans that handle the 'ceiling' function, as well as the 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions.

The 'sympify' function is located in 'sympy/core/sympify.py', where it controls the evaluation of expressions. The 'simplify' method within the 'Basic' class in 'sympy/core/basic.py' is also relevant, as it calls the 'simplify' function from Sympy's simplify module.
