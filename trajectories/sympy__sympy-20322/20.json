The issue describes that when `evaluate=False`, the expressions are not simplified as expected. This behavior needs to be consistent across versions. The search results contain several relevant code spans across multiple files, which handle the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions. These spans need to be analyzed to understand how the functions interact and how the inconsistencies might be addressed.\n\n1. **sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py**: Contains the definition of the `ceiling` function which is central to the issue. The `ceiling` class and its methods should be reviewed to ensure consistent behavior when expressions are simplified.\n2. **sympy/core/sympify.py**: Defines the `sympify` function which converts strings or other objects into SymPy expressions. The `evaluate` parameter's handling needs to be checked to ensure it behaves consistently with `False`.\n3. **sympy/core/basic.py**: Implements the `Basic` class with `simplify` method. This method is likely to be invoked in the expression simplification process.\n4. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: The `simplify` function itself is implemented here. It processes expressions and attempts to make them simpler. This part of the code needs to be carefully reviewed to see if it handles expressions involving `ceiling` appropriately.\n\nBy examining these identified code spans, a comprehensive understanding of the code involved in processing the expressions and simplifying them can be achieved. This will help in determining how to ensure consistent behavior across different versions of SymPy.",

The sympify function is responsible for converting strings into SymPy expressions, and the simplify function is used to simplify those expressions. The inconsistency arises when the evaluate flag is set to False. To address this, we need to ensure that the simplification logic for ceiling functions is consistent regardless of the evaluate flag. One potential approach is to modify the sympify function to handle ceiling functions uniformly during the conversion process, but without detailed knowledge of the internal mechanisms and without risking unintended consequences, a more focused approach is necessary. Given the complexity and potential side effects of modifying sympify, a targeted alteration within the simplify function could be more effective and safer.",
