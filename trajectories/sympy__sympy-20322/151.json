The analysis of the provided search results reveals several key aspects:\n\n1. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` has an argument `evaluate` which controls whether the expression should be evaluated during sympification. This directly relates to the reported issue where the `evaluate` parameter affects the behavior of `sympify`.\n\n2. The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is responsible for simplifying expressions. It uses various simplification techniques and includes the `ceiling` function among its imports. This suggests that changes in the simplification logic might be affecting the behavior of expressions involving `ceiling`.\n\n3. The `ceiling` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` is a critical part of the analysis. The spans related to `ceiling` include methods for evaluation, rewriting, and comparison, which are likely to be relevant to understanding and resolving the inconsistencies reported.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans are identified as those related to the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions. The identified spans provide a basis for further investigation and potential fixes to ensure consistent behavior across different versions of SymPy.",
