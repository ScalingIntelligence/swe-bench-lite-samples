The behavior changes between sympy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2 when the 'evaluate' parameter is set to False. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the sympify and simplify functions and their interaction with the ceiling function. Additionally, understanding how the evaluate parameter influences the behavior is key.

Specifically, the issue involves how expressions involving '4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)' are simplified when 'evaluate' is set to 'True' or 'False'. To address this, it's crucial to identify the code spans related to these functions. In the provided search results, several relevant files and spans are found:\n\n1. **sympy/core/sympify.py** - Contains the primary function 'sympify' which is central to the issue. It is responsible for converting inputs into SymPy objects. The involvement of 'evaluate' in the sympify function suggests this file is highly relevant. The spans 'sympify' and '_sympify' are critical here.\n\n2. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py** - This file contains the 'simplify' function which processes the simplification of mathematical expressions. Given the direct relevance of simplification to the issue, this file and its spans are essential. Notably, the 'simplify' span along with the import and usage of 'ceiling' within the same file is crucial.\n\n3. **sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py** - This file defines the 'ceiling' function, which is the core subject of the issue. The spans within this file, particularly the 'ceiling' class and its methods, are highly relevant. These methods include '_eval_number', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_floor', and evaluation methods like '_eval_is_nonpositive', '__lt__', '__gt__', and '__ge__', which are fundamental to understanding how the 'ceiling' function behaves under different conditions.\n\nGiven these analyses, the relevant code spans are identified as those mentioned above, which directly impact how sympify, simplify, and the ceiling function interact, especially concerning the evaluate parameter and the behavior across different versions of SymPy.",
