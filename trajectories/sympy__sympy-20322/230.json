The primary focus is on understanding and possibly adjusting the behavior of the `ceiling` function and the `simplify` method to ensure consistent output regardless of the `evaluate` parameter's value. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several key areas of interest:\n\n1. **sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py**: This function is critical as it converts inputs into SymPy objects. The `evaluate` parameter plays a significant role in how expressions are handled, which directly relates to the issue.\n\n2. **ceiling class and its methods in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py**: Various methods within the `ceiling` class are relevant, such as `_eval_number`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, `_eval_is_nonpositive`, etc. These methods define how the ceiling function behaves and interacts with other mathematical functions.\n\n3. **simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: This function is central to the issue as the inconsistency is observed in how it simplifies expressions involving the ceiling function. Understanding its logic and interplay with other functions like ceiling is crucial.\n\nBy examining these spans, we can delve deeper into how the ceiling function is treated and how modifications might be made to ensure internal consistency, especially related to the evaluation parameter in the sympify method. This ties back to ensuring that expressions simplifying in a consistent manner irrespective of the evaluation state.",
