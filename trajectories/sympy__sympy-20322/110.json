The issue states that there are inconsistencies between versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2 when 'evaluate' is set to False. We should focus on the parts of the code that handle these parameters and functions to understand why different versions behave differently.\n\n1. **sympify function (sympy/core/sympify.py)**: This function is responsible for converting the input to a SymPy expression. It includes handling of the 'evaluate' parameter, which could be influencing the behavior observed in the issue. We should look for how the 'evaluate' parameter is used and how expressions involving 'ceiling' are processed.\n\n2. **simplify function (sympy/simplify/simplify.py)**: This function deals with simplifying expressions. Since the issue involves both sympify and simplify, understanding how simplify handles expressions that result from sympify (especially with the 'evaluate' parameter set to False) is crucial.\n\nBy examining these functions, we can determine the relevance of the code spans provided in the search results to the reported issue.

The issue specifically notes that in SymPy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2, the simplification behavior is inconsistent when `evaluate` is `False`. Analyzing the provided code spans: The `sympify` function aligns closely with the issue as it handles the `evaluate` parameter and the conversion of expressions. The `simplify` function, particularly in `simplify.py`, also involves the simplification of expressions and is relevant to the issue. Additionally, the `ceiling` function in `integers.py` is directly related to the issue since it is the function in question. Therefore, these code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
