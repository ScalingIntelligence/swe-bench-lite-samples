To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the sympify function, the ceiling function, and the simplify method.\n\n- The sympify function is found in sympy/core/sympify.py, particularly in the span identified by id='sympify'. This span is crucial as it defines how expressions are converted to SymPy expressions, which is central to the issue.\n- The ceiling function is defined in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py, within the span identified by id='ceiling'. This is important because it directly relates to the functionality described in the issue.\n- The simplify method within the Basic class in sympy/core/basic.py, specifically the span identified by id='Basic.simplify', is also relevant as it handles the simplification of expressions.\n\nThese three spans cover the key components involved in the sympify and simplify processes, including the handling of the ceiling function, which is central to the reported issue.",

The issue is observed in different versions of SymPy, specifically v1.5.1 and v1.6.2. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the value of 'evaluate'. The initial analysis of the search results focuses on two main files: sympy/core/basic.py and sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py. In sympy/core/basic.py, the 'simplify' method is defined, which is central to the issue. This method calls the 'simplify' function from sympy.simplify. In sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py, the 'ceiling' class is defined, and multiple methods related to the ceiling function are implemented. These methods include '_eval_number', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_floor', '_eval_rewrite_as_frac', and others. These methods could potentially influence how the ceiling function is handled during simplification. Given the issue, it is crucial to understand and possibly adjust these methods to ensure consistent behavior. The relevant spans identified are primarily in the 'sympify' function (sympy/core/sympify.py) where the evaluate parameter is handled, and in the 'ceiling' class (sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py) where the behavior of the ceiling function is defined. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the methods related to the ceiling function, which are crucial for addressing the inconsistency in behavior.",
