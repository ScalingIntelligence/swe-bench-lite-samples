To investigate this, I will focus on the `sympy.core.sympify` module, the `sympy.simplify.simplify` module, and the `sympy.functions.elementary.integers` module, as these are likely places where the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions are defined or interact with each other.",

Specifically, the issue arises when `sympify` is called with `evaluate=False` and then the result is passed to `simplify`. The behavior differs between SymPy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle these functions:\n\n1. **sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py**: This function is responsible for converting a non-SymPy expression into a SymPy expression. The key parameter here is `evaluate`, which determines whether the expression should be evaluated during conversion.\n2. **simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: This function simplifies the given expression. It uses the `sympify` function internally and has parameters that control the simplification process.\n3. **ceiling function in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py**: This function represents the ceiling operation, and the reported issue involves expressions that use this function.\n\nGiven these points, the relevant code spans that need to be examined are those that handle the `sympify` and `simplify` functions and their interaction with the `ceiling` function. The identified spans include:\n- The definition of the `sympify` function in sympy/core/sympify.py.\n- The definition of the `simplify` function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py.\n- The implementation of the `ceiling` function and its various methods in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the inconsistent behavior described in the issue.",
