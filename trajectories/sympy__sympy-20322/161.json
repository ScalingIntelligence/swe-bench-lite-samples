The search results show two files of interest: 'sympy/core/sympify.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py'. In 'sympify.py', we find the main sympify function where the evaluate parameter is handled, which is crucial as it influences how expressions are parsed and simplified. In 'integers.py', we locate the ceiling class and its various evaluation methods (e.g., _eval_number, _eval_nseries, etc.), all of which are potential points of intervention for ensuring consistent behavior across different versions. By focusing on these areas, we can further investigate how changes in the evaluate parameter affect the simplification logic and implement any necessary adjustments for consistency.",

Glancing through the provided code spans, the initial focus is on `sympy/core/sympify.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`. Inspection of the `sympify` function reveals the handling of the `evaluate` parameter and its potential impact on the simplification process. The `ceiling` function's definitions and methods (like `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, etc.) in `integers.py` are also significant as they might directly relate to the reported inconsistent behavior. Furthermore, analysis of `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is crucial, as the `simplify` function's interactions with these methods under different conditions of `evaluate` might be responsible for the inconsistencies. From the code spans provided, it seems they directly touch upon the areas of concern linked with the issue report. Therefore, it's reasonable to identify these spans as relevant to investigate further for resolving the consistency issue.",

The specific area of concern is around line numbers 433-464 where the function handles non-strict input and attempts to convert it into a string for further processing, which includes evaluating arithmetic expressions. The task is to ensure that the ceiling function is handled consistently regardless of the evaluate parameter, so modifications are needed around the evaluation logic within the sympify function.",
