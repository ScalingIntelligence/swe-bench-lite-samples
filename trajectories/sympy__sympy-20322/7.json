'sympy/simplify/simplify.py': Contains the 'simplify' function definition, which includes handling different expressions and their simplification.\n2. 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py': Contains the 'ceiling' function definition, including its evaluation and rewrites.\n3. 'sympy/core/sympify.py': Contains the 'sympify' function definition, which handles the conversion of objects into SymPy expressions, including the handling of 'evaluate'.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they cover the main functions involved in the reported issue. The 'simplify' function directly handles simplification, the 'sympify' function could potentially affect how expressions are handled when 'evaluate' is set to 'False', and the 'ceiling' function is central to the issue itself. There seems to be a need to review and possibly modify the behavior of these functions to ensure consistency across versions and with the 'evaluate' parameter.",

The issue involves the behavior of `sympify` and `simplify` when processing expressions involving `ceiling`, specifically with the expression '4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)' under different conditions (evaluate=False and evaluate=True). We already have the relevant code spans from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`. The provided search results encompass additional methods like `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_frac`, `_eval_is_nonpositive`, and comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) in the `ceiling` class. These methods could be relevant for understanding the behavior of `ceiling` during simplification. Therefore, we are collecting all these relevant spans to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the issue and potential fixes.",

The task is to ensure consistency across different versions of SymPy. Initially, I looked at the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, which imports and uses the `ceiling` function from `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`. This function is central to the issue as it directly affects the simplification process. Further examination showed that the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` also plays a crucial role in parsing expressions involving `ceiling`, albeit at a different stage of the process. Additionally, I found the `evalf` function in `sympy/core/evalf.py`, which is responsible for numeric evaluation, including special handling for the `ceiling` function. These pieces are essential for understanding and resolving the inconsistency in behavior, making them relevant to the reported issue.",
