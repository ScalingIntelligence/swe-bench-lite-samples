The search results provide several relevant files and spans: 1. `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` contains the `ceiling` class and its methods, including `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, and others. 2. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` contains the `simplify` function and its handling of expressions, which may interact with the `ceiling` function. 3. `sympy/simplify/fu.py` and `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` may also contain relevant code for simplifying trigonometric functions, which could relate to simplifying expressions involving the `ceiling` function. By examining these spans, we can understand how the `simplify` function interacts with the `ceiling` function and identify potential areas for ensuring consistent behavior.",
