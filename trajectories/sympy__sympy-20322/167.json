It appears that different versions of SymPy handle this differently. The task is to ensure consistent behavior for sympify and simplify functions when 'evaluate' is False. By examining the provided search results, I look for sections of code that handle the sympify and simplify functions, particularly where the 'evaluate' parameter is processed and where the ceiling function is involved in the operations. The 'sympify' function definition in 'sympy/core/sympify.py' checks and uses the 'evaluate' parameter if provided, directly influencing how expressions are parsed and simplified. The 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' also plays a key role in handling expressions, potentially influencing how the ceiling function behaves during simplification. These sections of code are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of the software in line with the reported issue.",
