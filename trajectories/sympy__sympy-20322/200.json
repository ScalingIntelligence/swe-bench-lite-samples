The inconsistency arises from the evaluate flag being set to False in sympify, which affects the simplification outcome. To address this, we should focus on the sympify and simplify functions in sympy, as well as the ceiling function's implementation and how it interacts with these functions. Specifically, we can start by looking into the sympify.py and simplify.py files, and then move to the elementary/integers.py file to understand how the ceiling function is handled. Additionally, we should also consider the evaluate context management in parameters.py to see if global evaluation settings impact this behavior.",

The issue arises from different outcomes depending on whether `evaluate` is set to True or False. To address this, we need to look into the code of these functions and understand how they handle the `evaluate` parameter and the `ceiling` function. This includes checking the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions. The search results provided include the implementation of these functions in multiple files which is a good starting point. Notably, `sympy/core/sympify.py` contains the `sympify` and `_sympify` functions which handle the conversion to symbolic expressions, including logic based on `evaluate`. The `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file contains the `simplify` function which is responsible for simplifying expressions, and includes handling for `rational` and `ceiling` functions. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` file includes the implementation of the `ceiling` function which is crucial for understanding how the ceiling operation behaves in different scenarios. All of these need to be reviewed in the context of the `evaluate` parameter to determine why inconsistencies occur and how to make behavior consistent when `evaluate` is False.",
