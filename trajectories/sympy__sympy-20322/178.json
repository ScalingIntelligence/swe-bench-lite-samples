This suggests that changes in the logic for handling symbolic expressions with `ceiling` might have occurred between these versions, possibly within the `sympify`, `simplify`, or `ceiling` function definitions. Therefore, it's important to investigate the implementations of these functions and any related evaluation control mechanisms.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves inconsistent behavior of the `sympify` and `simplify` functions in SymPy when dealing with expressions involving the `ceiling` function. Specifically, the behavior changes when the `evaluate` parameter is set to `False` versus `True`. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code related to the `ceiling` function and its simplification. \n\n1. Analyzing the issue: The issue seems to be related to how the `ceiling` function is handled during the simplification process, especially when `evaluate=False`. We need to focus on the `ceiling` class and the `simplify` function in the provided search results.\n\n2. Reviewing code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`: This file contains the `ceiling` class definition with various methods like `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, `_eval_rewrite_as_frac`, `_eval_is_nonpositive`, and comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`). These methods are relevant to how the `ceiling` function behaves and how it can be rewritten or evaluated.\n\n3. Reviewing code spans in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`: This file contains the `simplify` function which is responsible for simplifying expressions. The `simplify` function includes various steps and methods to handle different types of expressions, including those with `ceiling` functions. Given the inconsistency reported, it's important to check how expressions involving `ceiling` are treated within the `simplify` function.\n\n4. Identifying relevant code spans: The code spans related to `ceiling` (`ceiling._eval_number`, `ceiling._eval_rewrite_as_floor`, `ceiling._eval_rewrite_as_frac`, etc.) and the `simplify` function are the most relevant to the reported issue. These spans cover the behavior of the `ceiling` function and how it interacts with the simplification process.\n\nConclusion: The identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the `ceiling` function's behavior and its integration within the simplification process in SymPy. These spans should help in understanding and potentially addressing the inconsistency reported in the issue.",
