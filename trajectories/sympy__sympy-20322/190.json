The provided search results include relevant code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. These spans define and handle the `ceiling` function and the `simplify` function, respectively. The analysis of these spans reveals methods that are directly related to the simplification and evaluation of expressions involving the `ceiling` function. Specifically, the `ceiling` class methods such as `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, `_eval_rewrite_as_frac`, `_eval_is_positive`, `_eval_is_nonpositive`, and comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`, `__le__`) are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the inconsistency in behavior related to the ceiling function.
