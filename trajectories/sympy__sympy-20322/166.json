The focus should be on the `sympify` and `simplify` functions and their interaction with the `ceiling` function. The `sympify` function seems to control whether the expression is evaluated (`evaluate=True`) or not (`evaluate=False`). The `simplify` function's behavior with the `ceiling` function also seems to be a key concern. Searching for these specific parts of the codebase should help identify the root cause of the inconsistency.",

The issue notes differences in behavior between sympy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2. The goal is to ensure consistency in the behavior regardless of the 'evaluate' flag. The analysis of the provided code reveals several relevant sections.\n\n1. 'sympify' function in sympy/core/sympify.py: This function is central to the issue as it converts an expression into a SymPy expression. The 'evaluate' parameter determines whether the expression should be evaluated.\n\n2. 'ceiling' function in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py: This is the core function handling 'ceiling' operations. Several spans are relevant, including '_eval_number', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_floor', '_eval_rewrite_as_frac', '_eval_is_nonpositive', '__lt__', '__gt__', and '__ge__'. Each of these spans handles different aspects of the 'ceiling' function and could impact the simplification behavior.\n\n3. 'simplify' function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py: This function is responsible for simplifying expressions. The 'simplify' span processes the simplification logic, including handling the 'evaluate' parameter, which affects the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, the identified code spans are all pertinent to the reported issue. The 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions, along with the 'ceiling' function and its various evaluators, are critical for addressing inconsistencies in the simplification process based on the 'evaluate' flag.",
