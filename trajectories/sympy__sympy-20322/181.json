The ceiling function is defined in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py, which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py is essential as it directly converts a string to a SymPy expression, which can be evaluated or not based on the evaluate flag. Furthermore, the simplify function implemented in sympy/core/basic.py is used to simplify expressions, and it needs to be examined to understand how it interacts with the ceiling function. The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py takes a more central role in actual simplification logic and is connected to the main simplification process, making it essential to review.
