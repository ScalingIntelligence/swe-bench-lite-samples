The core of the issue seems to be related to how the 'ceiling' function is evaluated and simplified under different conditions (i.e., with 'evaluate' set to True or False). The provided search results include several relevant code spans across multiple files that deal with the 'ceiling' function, its evaluation, and simplification. \n\n1. 'evalf_ceiling' and 'evalf_floor' functions in 'sympy/core/evalf.py' deal with the numerical evaluation of ceiling and floor functions, which might influence how expressions involving 'ceiling' are simplified. \n\n2. The 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' is directly related to the reported issue as it is responsible for simplifying expressions. The function contains logic to decide which simplification approach to take based on certain conditions. \n\n3. The 'ceiling' class definition and its methods in 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py' are crucial as they define the behavior of the 'ceiling' function itself, including its interaction with other mathematical functions and its evaluation under different circumstances. \n\n4. Other functions like 'nsimplify' and '_real_to_rational' in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' may play a role in converting expressions to a rational form, which could indirectly affect the simplification process of expressions involving 'ceiling'. \n\nGiven these insights, it is clear that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they cover the necessary functionality related to the 'ceiling' function and its simplification. However, further investigation might be needed to understand how these pieces interact and to ensure that the behavior is consistent across different evaluation states.",
