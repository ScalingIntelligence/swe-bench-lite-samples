The issue is evident in different versions of sympy where the simplification results vary based on the 'evaluate' parameter. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the ceiling function, sympify, and simplification. The search results provided contain several key spans across different files. First, we see the 'ceiling' class definition in 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py', which is likely where the ceiling function's behavior is defined. Next, we have 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions spread across multiple files like 'sympy/core/sympify.py' and 'sympy/core/basic.py', which are crucial for understanding how sympify and simplify interact with other functions like ceiling. Additionally, there are several implementations of the 'simplify' method in different contexts, such as 'BooleanFunction.simplify' and 'MatrixOperations.simplify', highlighting the flexibility and complexity of the simplify function across different SymPy classes. The 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' file is especially important as it defines the global 'simplify' function that could be impacting the behavior observed in the issue. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans are those that deal directly with the ceiling function, the sympify function, and the global simplify function. These spans will help in understanding how the evaluation of expressions involving ceiling can be made consistent across different scenarios.",
