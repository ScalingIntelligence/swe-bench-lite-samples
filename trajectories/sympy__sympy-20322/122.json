This can be useful in cooperation\n    with SAGE.\n\n    .. warning::\n        Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn't be used on\n        unsanitized input.\n\n    If the argument is already a type that SymPy understands, it will do\n    nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a\n    function to ensure you are working with the correct type.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import sympify\n\n    >>> sympify(2).is_integer\n    True\n    >>> sympify(2).is_real\n    True\n\n    >>> sympify(2.0).is_real\n    True\n    >>> sympify(\"2.0\").is_real\n    True\n    >>> sympify(\"2e-45\").is_real\n    True\n\n    If the expression could not be converted, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    >>> sympify(\"x***2\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    SympifyError: SympifyError: \"could not parse 'x***2'\"\n\n    Locals\n    ------\n\n    The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded\n    by ``from sympy import *``; anything used in a string that is not\n    defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n    >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\n    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\n    names that are defined in abc).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> _clash1\n    {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}\n    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other\n    cases, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    >>> print(sympify(None))\n    None\n    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    SympifyError: SympifyError: None\n\n    Evaluation\n    ----------\n\n    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\n    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\n    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\n    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\n    before being passed to sympify, so adding evaluate=False will still\n    return the evaluated result of expression.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\n    9\n    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\n    4/2 + 7\n    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\n    9.00000000000000\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    convert_xor\n    -----------\n\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n    x**y\n    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n    x ^ y\n\n    rational\n    --------\n\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n    0.1\n    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n    1/10\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    a :\n        - any object defined in SymPy\n        - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal\n        - strings (like \"0.09\", \"2e-19\" or 'sin(x)')\n        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)\n        - dict, lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above\n\n    convert_xor : boolean, optional\n        If true, treats XOR as exponentiation.\n        If False, treats XOR as XOR itself.\n        Used only when input is a string.\n\n    locals : any object defined in SymPy, optional\n        In order to have strings be recognized it can be imported\n        into a namespace dictionary and passed as locals.\n\n    strict : boolean, optional\n        If the option strict is set to True, only the types for which\n        an explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the\n        other cases, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    rational : boolean, optional\n        If true, converts floats into Rational.\n        If false, it lets floats remain as it is.\n        Used only when input is a string.\n\n    evaluate : boolean, optional\n        If False, then arithmetic and operators will be converted into\n        their SymPy equivalents. If True the expression will be evaluated\n        and the result will be returned.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    # XXX: If a is a Basic subclass rather than instance (e.g. sin rather than\n    # sin(x)) then a.__sympy__ will be the property.
