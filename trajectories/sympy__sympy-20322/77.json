            "scratch_pad": "1. The issue relates to the behavior of `sympify` and `simplify` functions in sympy when dealing with expressions involving 'ceiling'. The key problem is to ensure that the behavior of these functions remains consistent, especially when the 'evaluate' parameter is set to 'False'. \n2. From the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file, the `evalf_ceiling` function is identified as relevant since it involves evaluation of 'ceiling' expressions. The `get_integer_part` function is also relevant because it may affect the evaluation of the integer parts of expressions which often involve ceiling or floor functions.\n3. In `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, the `ceiling` class is essential as it defines the behavior of the 'ceiling' function itself. The methods within this class such as `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, and `_eval_is_nonpositive` seem particularly relevant because they handle specific aspects of the ceiling function that could influence simplification or evaluation with 'evaluate=False'.\n4. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is central to the issue as it directly involves the conversion of expressions and the handling of the 'evaluate' parameter. Understanding how 'sympify' treats these cases would be crucial.\n5. Simplification is handled by the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. This function and how it's invoked within context (such as in Matrix or Vector simplification) indicate nodes that might affect the inconsistency reported in the issue.\n6. Considering the broader context, conflicts or discrepancies in simplification paths involving `ceiling` across different versions are likely rooted in these identified areas. Further analysis may be needed to dissect specific calls or behavior differences between versions.",

The change should be made without altering the current logic of the `sympify` function.\n\nThe instruction requires modifying the `simplify` function to ensure consistent simplification of expressions involving the ceiling function regardless of the `evaluate` flag. The relevant part of the code to modify is the `_eval_simplify` method, which handles the internal simplification logic. However, since the instruction specifies not to alter the current logic of the `sympify` function, we should focus on the part of the `simplify` function that calls `_eval_simplify` on the expression. The code should be adjusted to handle the ceiling function explicitly within the simplification process without altering the rest of the logic.",
