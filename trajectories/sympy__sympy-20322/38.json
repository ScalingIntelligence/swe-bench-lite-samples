The issue notes that the behavior varies based on the evaluate flag during sympify operations.

The provided search results include code spans from sympy/core/sympify.py and sympy/simplify/simplify.py, which are directly relevant to the issue. The sympify function definition is crucial as it handles the conversion of expressions to symbolic form and includes the evaluate parameter that impacts the simplification behavior. Additionally, the simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is relevant as it defines the main simplification logic. It processes expressions through various simplification strategies, possibly influencing how ceiling expressions are handled.

Specifically the issue is concerned with the evaluate argument and how it affects the output in different versions of sympy. When looking through the search results and comparing with the file context, I notice that the 'sympify' function code span in both the file context and the search results is the same, handling the evaluation argument and parsing expressions from strings. This suggests that the 'sympify' function needs special handling for the 'evaluate' argument in order to achieve consistent behavior especially with expressions involving special functions like 'ceiling'. Therefore this span of code in 'sympy/core/sympify.py' should be further investigated for implications on the issue of inconsistent behavior with ceiling. The 'simplify' function code span shows the general structure of the simplify function demonstrating how expressions are simplified based on various rules and transformations.",
