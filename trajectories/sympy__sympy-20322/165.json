The behavior changes based on whether the 'evaluate' parameter is set to True or False. To ensure consistent behavior, it's essential to understand how the 'ceiling' function is being processed and simplified in both scenarios. Relevant files and functions to investigate include the sympify function in 'sympy/core/sympify.py', the simplify function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and the ceiling function in 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py'. Additionally, the 'evaluate' parameter handling in 'sympy/core/parameters.py' should be reviewed. Two search requests are made: one focusing on the 'ceiling' function and its handling in simplification, and another to ensure that the behavior of 'evaluate' parameter is consistent across different versions.",

Additionally, comparisons methods (__lt__, __gt__, __ge__, __le__) could be relevant for understanding how 'ceiling' interacts with other expressions.

The issue highlights differences in evaluation results when 'evaluate' is set to True or False. The search results include code spans from 'sympy/core/sympify.py' and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py'. The 'sympify' function has been identified with its handling of the 'evaluate' parameter, which could influence the behavior seen in the issue. Additionally, the 'simplify' function is found in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', which is a key function involved in the reported inconsistent behavior. The 'ceiling' function and its associated methods are already identified in the file context, which is relevant to understanding the issue. The 'ceiling' function's methods such as '_eval_number', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_floor', and '_eval_rewrite_as_frac' are crucial for understanding how the ceiling function behaves during simplification. The 'simplify' function's implementation includes handling of various expressions, including those with 'ceiling' functions, which directly relates to the issue at hand. Further analysis of the 'simplify' function can provide insights into how expression simplification is managed when 'evaluate' is set to different values. Identifying these relevant code spans will help in understanding the code's behavior and making any necessary adjustments to ensure consistent behavior across different evaluations.",
