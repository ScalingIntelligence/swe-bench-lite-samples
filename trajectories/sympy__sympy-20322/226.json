This suggests that the issue could be related to how the `ceiling` function is being handled internally within these operations, especially how it interacts with the `evaluate` flag.\n\nStep 1: Recognize the `ceiling` function within the reported issue and look for related code spans. In the search results, all code spans under `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` directly relate to the `ceiling` class, which is highly pertinent.\n\nStep 2: In `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function and its interactions with various mathematical functions, including piecewise functions, logs, trigonometric functions, and gamma functions, must be considered. This file could have code initiatives that influence how `ceiling` and other functions are handled during simplification.\n\nStep 3: After reviewing the contexts and linked issues, it appears that the identified code spans are suitable matches for beginning to resolve the problem. Specifically, they provide the tools necessary to modify how the `ceiling` function behaves during a `simplify` or `sympify` operation under differing `evaluate`conditions. Understanding `ceiling`'s expected outputs and controlling functional responses accordingly may be achieved through manipulations identified within these code spans.\n\nThe selected code spans are convincing starting points to delve into and rectify the specific performance issue documented, highlighting the potential regions of SymPy's codebase that control `ceiling` function behaviors during standard float input handling.",

The task is to find relevant code spans to address this inconsistency. Given the context and search results, the relevant parts of the code are those that define the `ceiling` function and the `simplify` function, as well as any related evaluations or rewrites.
