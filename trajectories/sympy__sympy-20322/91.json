The issue suggests that the behavior differs based on the evaluate flag, which likely involves the sympify function and the simplify methods associated with the ceiling function. The search results provide several relevant spans that may contribute to understanding or addressing this issue:\n\n1. `sympy/core/sympify.py` - This file contains the `sympify` function, which is responsible for converting objects into instances that can be used by SymPy. It includes handling of the `evaluate` flag.\n2. `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` - This file defines the `ceiling` function and its behavior. It contains methods such as `_eval_number`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, and comparisons methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`), which are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to the ceiling function.\n3. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - This file contains the `simplify` function, which is likely where the simplification logic applies specifically when `evaluate=False`.\n4. Additional spans in `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, and others also touch on the `simplify` method across different classes in SymPy, which may offer insights into how simplification is handled in various contexts.\n\nBy focusing on these specific spans within the listed files, I will attempt to piece together the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with the `evaluate` flag and the behavior of `simplify` when dealing with expressions involving the ceiling function.",
