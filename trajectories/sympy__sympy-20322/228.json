The issue revolves around how expressions containing 'ceiling' are handled differently in different versions of sympy, and the desired outcome is consistent behavior regardless of the 'evaluate' parameter's value. Relevant code spans should include definitions and operations related to sympify, simplify, and ceiling functions, particularly focusing on how the 'evaluate' parameter is managed and how expressions involving 'ceiling' are processed. From the search results, sympify.py contains the definition of the sympify function where the 'evaluate' parameter is handled, while integers.py contains the definition of the ceiling function and its methods. Additionally, simplify.py contains the simplify function definition, which likely involves how expressions are processed, including those with 'ceiling'. These files and their relevant spans appear to be directly relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",
