From the provided search results, the relevant files are sympy/simplify/simplify.py and sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py. We need to identify the relevant code spans within these files that deal with the simplification of expressions, including those involving the 'ceiling' function. Additionally, the changes in behavior might be due to the different handling of the 'evaluate' flag during sympify.
