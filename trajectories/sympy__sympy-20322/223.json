The main areas of concern here are the sympy.sympify function that parses the input expression and the sympy.simplify function that simplifies expressions. Additionally, the ceiling function's implementation in sympy.functions.elementary.integers should be evaluated for any behavioral changes between versions. Searching within sympy module for functions like sympify, simplify, and ceiling could provide useful insight into the inconsistencies noted.",

Analyzing the 'ceiling' function implementation in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py to understand its behavior during simplification and other potential influencing factors.\n4. Identifying the key code spans that define and manipulate the 'ceiling' function and understanding how these might affect the evaluation context and its simplification process.\n5.
