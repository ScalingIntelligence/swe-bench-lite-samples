To investigate the cause of this inconsistency, we need to focus on the `sympify` and `simplify` functions, the `ceiling` function itself, and any related operations that might affect their behavior. Specifically, we should look into the changes between SymPy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2 that could lead to this inconsistency. The provided context suggests that the potential areas of interest include the handling of the 'ceiling' function in `sympy.functions.elementary.integers`, and the `simplify` method in `sympy.simplify.simplify`. Additionally, the `evaluate` parameter in `sympy.core.sympify` and related transformers in `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser` are likely to play a crucial role. To ensure a thorough search, we will specify both a file pattern and a function name to focus on the relevant files and functionalities.",

Similarly, the 'sympy.core.sympify' file includes the 'sympify' function, which is crucial for parsing inputs and controlling the evaluate parameter. Additionally, the 'sympy.simplify.simplify' file encapsulates the 'simplify' function, where the simplification logic resides.
