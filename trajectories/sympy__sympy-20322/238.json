In v1.5.1, the output remains unchanged regardless of `evaluate` being True or False, whereas in v1.6.2, setting `evaluate=False` changes the output format. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior across versions. By examining the relevant code spans in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/core/sympify.py`, particular attention should be paid to the `simplify` function and how it handles expressions with ceiling functions when `evaluate=False`. Additionally, understanding how the `sympify` function processes expressions with `evaluate=False` is crucial to identify if the behavior inconsistency is rooted in expression handling or simplification logic. The code spans in both files, especially those focusing on `sympify` and `simplify`, need detailed examination to pinpoint where the behavior diverges between versions and identify potential fixes to ensure consistency. Further, considering the possibility that the issue might be linked to specific condition handling or evaluation control flow within these functions, reviewing the entire context (not just isolated spans) is important for a thorough analysis.",

The error occurs specifically in versions v1.5.1 and v.1.6.2, suggesting that changes in the simplify function or the sympify function (when evaluate is False) might be the root cause. To locate the problem, I should focus my search on the simplify function within the simplify.py file, as well as the sympify function in core/sympify.py, considering the evaluate context. The provided file context includes the relevant code from both simplify.py and sympify.py, which is necessary to address the issue.

Ensure that the added code follows the function's existing indentation and scope rules.\n\nThe newly added code modifies the simplify function to handle the ceiling function consistently. The added code starts on line 598 and extends to line 603. The relevance of these lines lies in the modification executed during the simplification process, especially focusing on expressions involving ceiling functions and ensuring they remain unchanged regardless of the evaluate flag set. These lines of code are part of the lambda function transformations applied to the expr object within the simplify function",
