The observed behavior changes between different versions of sympy. The key focus is to identify code spans that might be causing this inconsistency, especially in how `ceiling` is handled in `sympify` and `simplify`. Relevant files to check are those related to sympifying and simplifying expressions, and specifically those handling the `ceiling` function. After reviewing the search results, the following files and spans appear relevant: 1. `sympy/core/sympify.py` - spans related to `sympify` function. 2. `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` - spans defining and handling the `ceiling` function. 3. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - spans related to the `simplify` function. These spans include operations and evaluations specific to the `ceiling` function and its interaction with `sympify` and `simplify`. Specifically, the spans in `sympy/core/sympify.py` that deal with the `evaluate` parameter, and those in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` handling the `ceiling` function's evaluation and rewriting, seem most pertinent to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue of inconsistent behavior.",
