The behavior differs between sympy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2 when the `evaluate` parameter is set to `False`. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior across different versions. Relevant files include those related to sympification, simplification, and the `ceiling` function itself. The search should focus on these specific areas to identify the code responsible for the differing behaviors.",

The primary focus is to identify the relevant code sections that deal with the `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling` functions to understand how they handle `evaluate` parameter and ensure consistency. From the search results, the relevant code spans are in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`. In `sympify.py`, the `sympify` function and its handling of the `evaluate` parameter seem relevant. In `simplify.py`, the `simplify` function and associated methods may impact how expressions with `ceiling` are simplified. Finally, in `integers.py`, the `ceiling` class definition and its methods (like `_eval_number`, `_eval_rewrite_as_floor`, etc.) are directly related to the function's behavior. These sections should help in understanding and addressing the reported issue.",
