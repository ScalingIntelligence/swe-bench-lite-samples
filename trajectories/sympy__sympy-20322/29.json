The issue can be observed in different versions of sympy (v1.5.1 vs v1.6.2). It seems that the 'ceiling' function behaves differently in these scenarios and there is a need to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the 'evaluate' parameter.\n\nFrom the provided context, we already have relevant code spans from 'sympy/core/sympify.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py'. These are related to the 'sympify' function and the 'ceiling' class respectively.\n\nIn the new search results, there are multiple code spans from 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py' and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py'.These are related to additional methods within the 'ceiling' class ('_eval_number', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_floor', '_eval_rewrite_as_frac', '_eval_is_nonpositive', '__lt__', '__gt__', '__ge__') which can potentially influence the behavior of the 'ceiling' function depending on their evaluation modes. Also, there is 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' which might interact with 'ceiling' during expression simplification depending on the 'evaluate' parameter.\n\nThese code spans should cover different scenarios involving the 'ceiling' function and can help identify and fix the inconsistency reported in the issue.",

The provided search results contain relevant code spans from the 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions as well as the 'ceiling' function. These code spans are crucial for understanding how the 'sympify' function handles the 'evaluate' flag and how the 'simplify' function processes expressions.
