The inconsistency arises when the `evaluate` flag is set to `False` during the parsing stage. To ensure consistent behavior, I need to investigate the `ceiling` function's handling in `sympify` and `simplify`, focusing on how the `evaluate` flag affects the transformation or simplification process. Based on the provided file context, I should look into the relevant files where these functions are defined or used.",

The key points to focus on are the handling of the `ceiling` function and the `evaluate` parameter. The search results provide functions such as `evalf_ceiling`, `evalf_floor`, and their respective implementations. These functions directly deal with the evaluation of ceiling and floor functions, which are central to the issue. For instance, `evalf_ceiling` uses `get_integer_part` to compute the ceiling function, which is likely involved in the simplification process where inconsistencies arise. Moreover, the detailed implementations of `ceiling` and `floor` in terms of evaluations and rewrites suggest that changes in how these functions interact with the evaluation context might lead to different outcomes. Thus, these code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",

The file context includes the necessary code for `evalf_ceiling` and `evalf_floor` in `sympy/core/evalf.py`, which are crucial for determining the integer part of expressions. Additionally, the `ceiling` and `floor` classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` are provided, showing how these functions evaluate numerically. Furthermore, the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` and the main `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` are included, demonstrating how symbolic expressions are processed and simplified, including handling of the `evaluate` flag.
