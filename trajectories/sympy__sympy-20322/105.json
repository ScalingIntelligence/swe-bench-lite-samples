The analysis should focus on how the evaluate parameter affects these operations and how the ceiling function is processed during simplification. The provided search results include multiple files and code spans that are potentially related to the issue. Specifically, the sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py, the ceiling function in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py, and the simplify function in sympy/core/basic.py are relevant as they directly deal with the conversion of expressions to symbolic form, the handling of the ceiling function, and the simplification of expressions, respectively. Additionally, the simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is crucial as it is the main function responsible for simplifying expressions in sympy. By examining these code spans, we can determine if they directly relate to the reported issue and if they offer insights into how to ensure consistent behavior across different versions of sympy.",
