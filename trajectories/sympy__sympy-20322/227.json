Specifically, the `sympy.sympify` function with `evaluate=False` produces different results in version 1.5.1 and 1.6.2. To ensure consistent behavior, we need to investigate the relevant parts of the `sympify` and `simplify` functions as well as the `ceiling` function. We should focus on the parts of the code that handle evaluation and simplification logic for expressions involving `ceiling`.",

The relevant files identified from the search results are: `sympy/core/sympify.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. These files contain the definitions and logic for `sympify`, `simplify`, and the `ceiling` function. In particular, the `sympify` function logic including the `sympify` and `_convert_numpy_types` span ids are relevant for understanding how the function handles the `evaluate` flag. The `ceiling` function implementation in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, especially the `ceiling._eval_number` span id is relevant for understanding the behavior of the ceiling function. Finally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` with the `simplify` span id is relevant for how simplification interacts with the `evaluate` flag.
