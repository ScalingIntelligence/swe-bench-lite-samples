            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns inconsistent behavior in the sympify/simplify function of SymPy when dealing with the ceiling function, particularly in different versions of SymPy. The issue highlights that the behavior of the simplify function changes depending on whether the evaluate flag is set to True or False. Version 1.5.1 of SymPy produces the same results regardless of the evaluate flag, but in version 1.6.2, setting evaluate to False results in a different simplification compared to when it is set to True.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to examine the simplify function and its handling of the ceiling function across different versions. The search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the simplify function and the ceiling class definition. Specifically, the simplify function and its nested functions for deciding whether to evaluate expressions, as well as the ceiling class and its methods for evaluating and rewriting, are critical areas to focus on.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the relevant code spans are those that define how simplification operations handle expressions involving the ceiling function. Key spans include the imports, def simplify, def _real_to_rational, and the methods of the ceiling class such as ceiling._eval_number, ceiling._eval_rewrite_as_floor, and ceiling._eval_rewrite_as_frac. These spans are likely to contain the logic that determines how expressions involving the ceiling function are simplified, and thus are directly relevant to the reported inconsistency in behavior.",
