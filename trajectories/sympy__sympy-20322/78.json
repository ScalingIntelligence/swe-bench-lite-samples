The main focus should be on understanding the implementation of 'sympify', 'simplify', and 'ceiling' in different versions of sympy. The files 'sympy/core/sympify.py', 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py' are likely the most relevant ones due to their direct involvement in the operations mentioned in the issue. Additionally, considering the changes observed between versions, it seems crucial to check how 'evaluate' affects these functionalities in these files.",

To address this, we need to look into the 'sympify' and 'simplify' functions and their handling of the 'ceiling' function, especially considering the 'evaluate' flag. The provided search results contain relevant code spans from 'sympy/core/sympify.py' and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', which deal with the core functionality of 'sympify' and 'simplify' respectively. Additionally, 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py' contains the implementation of the 'ceiling' function, which is directly involved in the issue.

The issue specifically mentions differences in the output of expressions like `sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()` between SymPy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2. This suggests that changes in the simplify function or its underlying logic (e.g., changes in how expressions with ceiling are handled) could be the root cause. The search results provide code spans from `sympy/core/sympify.py` and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` which contain the definition and usage of `sympify` and `simplify` functions. Additionally, `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` contains the definition of the `ceiling` function.\n\nGiven the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are those that define and use the `simplify` function, including handling expressions with the ceiling function. The spans identified are from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, particularly the `simplify` function and its helper functions that process different types of expressions, including those with functions like ceiling, as well as from `sympy/core/sympify.py` for the `sympify` function.\n\nTo ensure consistent behavior, it might involve examining and possibly modifying the logic within the `simplify` function where expressions involving the ceiling function are processed. This could involve ensuring that the simplification logic handles expressions with ceiling in a consistent manner regardless of the evaluation context (e.g., with evaluate set to True or False).",

Specifically, ensure that the simplification of expressions involving ceiling does not change based on the evaluate flag.\n\nThe sympify function already handles the evaluation of expressions based on the evaluate flag. To ensure that the simplification of expressions involving the ceiling function does not change based on the evaluate flag, we need to modify the conversion process for expressions containing the ceiling function. This can be done by extending the standard transformations with a custom transformation that specifically handles the ceiling function. The relevant lines for this modification are where the transformations are defined and applied during the parsing of the input string.",
