Specifically, the issue is observed in different versions of SymPy (v1.5.1 vs v1.6.2) with varying results when `evaluate` is set to `False` or `True`. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code in SymPy that deal with `sympify`, `simplify`, and `ceiling`. From the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are those that define and handle the `simplify` function and the `ceiling` function. The `simplify` function's logic is complex and involves various transformations and simplifications applied to expressions, including those containing `ceiling`. The `ceiling` class definitions include methods for evaluation, comparison, and rewriting, which could influence the behavior of expressions during simplification. Therefore, these code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue of inconsistent behavior.",
