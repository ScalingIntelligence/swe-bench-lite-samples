The relevant files and functions to investigate include `sympy/core/sympify.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`. Specifically, the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` and the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` are likely places to start. Additionally, the `ceiling` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` should be examined for any changes between versions that could impact behavior.",

Each file contains relevant code spans that might affect the processing of 'ceiling' function expressions and their simplification. The 'sympify' function is responsible for converting non-SymPy objects into SymPy objects, which could impact how the 'ceiling' function is handled. The 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' is directly related to the simplification process mentioned in the issue. Lastly, 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py' contains the implementation of the 'ceiling' function itself, which is central to the issue.
