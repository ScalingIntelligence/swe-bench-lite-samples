The inconsistency is observed between different versions of Sympy (v1.5.1 vs v1.6.2) under different evaluation contexts (evaluate=True vs evaluate=False). The goal is to identify the code responsible for this behavior to ensure consistency across different evaluation settings. The relevant files seem to center around the 'sympify', 'simplify', and 'ceiling' functions within Sympy. Potentially relevant files include sympy/core/sympify.py, sympy/simplify/simplify.py, and sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py.",

Reviewed the current file context which indicated no relevant code has been previously identified. 3. Processed the provided search results in three files: 'sympy/core/sympify.py', 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py'. 4. Identified relevant code spans within these files that directly relate to 'sympify', 'simplify', and 'ceiling' functions which align with the reported issue. 5. Noted that the issue around 'ceiling' is specifically in 'sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py' where the 'ceiling' class is defined with various methods like '_eval_number', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_floor', '_eval_rewrite_as_frac', '_eval_is_nonpositive', '__lt__', '__gt__', '__ge__'. 6. In 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', the 'simplify' function is defined which is likely involved in the simplification process mentioned in the issue. 7. In 'sympy/core/sympify.py', several functions and classes are relevant including 'sympify', '_sympify', 'SympifyError', and '_convert_numpy_types' which could be connected to the issue when sympifying expressions before simplification. 8. Determined that the provided code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue about inconsistent simplification with 'ceiling'.",
