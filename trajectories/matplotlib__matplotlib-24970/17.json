The warnings stem from out-of-bound integer conversions in the Matplotlib's color management functions. The stack trace points to the 'colors.py' file in the 'matplotlib' directory, detailing where the warnings are originating. It's evident from the stack trace that the deprecation warnings are raised within the 'colors.py' file due to operations involving types like 'uint8'. Thus, the immediate task is to locate the exact problematic sections in 'colors.py' which handle these conversions and are likely to need adjustment to comply with upcoming NumPy changes.",
