The warnings indicate that NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays, specifically in the context of converting values to uint8. The provided code for reproduction uses `matplotlib.colors` functions, such as `get_cmap` and `to_rgba_array`. The search results include several functions (`same_color`, `to_rgba`, `to_rgba_array`) that are relevant to color conversion and could be involved in the operation that triggers the deprecation warnings. The `to_rgba_array` function is particularly relevant as it directly interacts with NumPy arrays and can handle conversion of colors including alpha channel. The `ColorConverter` class also appears in both contexts, indicating its importance in the color conversion process. These functions and the class encapsulate the logic that could be causing the warnings. Therefore, the identified code spans should help in addressing the issue by examining how these functions handle integer conversion and potentially modify them to avoid the deprecation warnings.",
