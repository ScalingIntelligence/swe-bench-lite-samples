The relevant code spans should focus on areas where these conversions might be occurring. The search results provided include multiple classes and methods from 'lib/matplotlib/image.py' which are directly involved in image rendering and transformation. Notably, the '_make_image' method in the '_ImageBase' class and the 'make_image' methods in subclasses like 'AxesImage', 'NonUniformImage', 'PcolorImage', 'FigureImage', and 'BboxImage' deal with image data and transformations. These methods handle the conversion and processing of image arrays, which is where the NumPy deprecation warnings are likely to originate. Given the nature of the issue, these sections of the code are highly relevant for further inspection as they involve operations on image data that could potentially trigger the deprecation warnings related to out-of-bound integers.

The specific warnings relate to the conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays, which will be disallowed in future versions of NumPy. This issue is critical because it affects the functionality of Matplotlib when used with newer versions of NumPy. The task is to identify relevant code spans in the search results that address this specific issue. The <file_context> tag has already highlighted the relevant files and parts of code, particularly in 'lib/matplotlib/image.py', associated with image rendering and manipulation within Matplotlib. The new search results in <search_results> also include files related to image handling and color mapping. Notably, the 'lib/matplotlib/image.py' file contains methods that involve image data processing, transformation, and rendering, which are potentially affected by the deprecation warnings related to NumPy's handling of integer arrays. The task has identified these sections as highly relevant because they directly involve the types of operations that the deprecation warnings suggest need attention, particularly in the handling and transformation of image data arrays. We need to verify whether the identified code spans in 'lib/matplotlib/image.py' handle these operations in ways that could trigger the deprecation warnings and determine the steps required to address them. It's important to consider that this section of the codebase does not directly mention or handle the specific integer conversion warnings from NumPy, yet the nature of the operations involved (like array manipulations and transformations) and the dependency on NumPy for these operations make it highly likely that updates will be necessary to mitigate the warnings described in the issue. Therefore, the relevance of these sections is inferred from the potential applicability of NumPy's new restrictions on the large-scale operations they perform.",
