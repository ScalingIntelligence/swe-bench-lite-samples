The key components identified from the issue are the `ForeignKey` field, `limit_choices_to`, and potential duplication issues in form fields. The provided search results include several relevant sections from the Django codebase that directly relate to these components. \n\nFirst, in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey` class and its methods like `__init__` and `formfield` are identified. These are crucial as they define how the ForeignKey field is initialized and how its form field is generated. Additionally, the `RelatedField` and `ForeignObject` classes are relevant as they are the base classes for `ForeignKey`. \n\nNext, `django/forms/models.py` contains the `ModelChoiceField` class, which is directly used in the `formfield` method of `ForeignKey`. This class and its methods, such as `__init__`, `get_limit_choices_to`, and `_get_choices`, are critical for understanding how the choices for a form field are limited and generated. \n\nLastly, `django/contrib/admin/options.py` includes the `BaseModelAdmin` class, specifically the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method, which customizes form fields for foreign keys in the admin interface. This method uses `limit_choices_to` to control the queryset of the form field.\n\nBased on the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue and their roles in handling ForeignKey fields and form field generation, these sections are deemed relevant. The search task can be considered complete based on the identification of these relevant spans.",
