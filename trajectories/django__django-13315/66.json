To address this, we need to look at how `limit_choices_to` is used and how options are generated in the form field. The provided file context and search results include relevant sections of code from `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and `django/forms/models.py`. In `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey`, `RelatedField`, and `ForeignObject` classes handle the `limit_choices_to` parameter and form field generation. Specifically, the `formfield` method in `RelatedField` and the `__init__` method in `ForeignKey` are significant. In `django/forms/models.py`, the `ModelChoiceField` class handles the generation of choices based on the queryset, which is influenced by `limit_choices_to`. This helps in understanding the flow from setting `limit_choices_to` in the model field to its effect on the form field. Thus, the relevant code spans identified focus on these areas to address the issue of duplicate options in form fields.",
