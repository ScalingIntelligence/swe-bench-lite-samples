The current context provides several relevant code spans, including the `ForeignKey` class and its `formfield` method, as well as the `ModelChoiceField` class and its methods in `django/forms/models.py`. Additionally, the `apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield` function is responsible for applying the `limit_choices_to` to the formfield's queryset. The new search results reinforce the relevance of the `ModelChoiceField` class, particularly its `__init__` and `get_limit_choices_to` methods, which deal directly with the `limit_choices_to` argument and its application. The `ForeignKey.formfield` method is also relevant as it constructs the form field for the ForeignKey, using `ModelChoiceField`.
