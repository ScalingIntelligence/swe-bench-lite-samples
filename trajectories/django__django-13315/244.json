To address this, we should focus our search on the ForeignKey class methods within the Django ORM and forms modules. Specifically, we should look for methods that handle the creation of form fields, such as 'formfield', and methods that apply constraints like 'apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield'. Additionally, we should also consider related classes like ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField that handle choices and filtering.",

There's also a mention of complex filtering with Q objects. In django/forms/models.py, the apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield function applies the limit_choices_to parameter to form fields, which directly relates to the issue. In django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, the Field class has a formfield method and a get_choices method, which also deal with choices and filtering. The django/contrib/admin/options.py file contains functions for generating form fields for foreign keys and many-to-many relationships, which are relevant for understanding how forms are handled in the admin interface. The django/contrib/admin/widgets.py file includes widgets for displaying foreign key fields in the admin interface, which could affect how duplicates are displayed.
