This method is used to consolidate the scale factors and dimensions of an expression involving quantities. The specific problem arises when attempting to add quantities with different but equivalent dimensions, leading to a ValueError. The code provided in the search results includes the implementation of the 'UnitSystem' class and the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, there is a deprecated static method 'Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension' that refers to the same functionality but is recommended to use the equivalent method in the 'UnitSystem' class. Based on the reported issue, the relevant code spans would include the entire '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method in the 'UnitSystem' class, as this method is responsible for the logic that consolidates factors and dimensions, and where the error is occurring. The 'Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension' method serves as a deprecated reference and does not directly contribute to the solution but confirms the location of the updated method in the 'UnitSystem' class.",
