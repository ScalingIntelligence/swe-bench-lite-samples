The issue is that when adding quantities with different but equivalent dimensions, the function raises a ValueError due to a mismatch in dimensions. This suggests that the function is failing to recognize equivalent dimensions during the addition operation.\n\nUpon reviewing the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method in the search results, it is clear that the function processes expressions recursively to gather scale factors and dimensions. However, the method currently does not handle the identification of equivalent dimensions during addition.\n\nFrom the given search results, the relevant code spans are:\n- The '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method itself, which is responsible for collecting factors and dimensions.\n- The 'Dimension' class, which is likely used to represent dimensions and could potentially include logic for recognizing equivalent dimensions.\n\nThe method raises a ValueError when it detects a mismatch in dimensions during addition. This indicates that the method needs to be enhanced to recognize equivalent dimensions, and possibly to normalize dimensions before comparison to avoid such errors.\n\nThe '_QuantityMapper' class and its methods 'set_quantity_dimension' and 'set_quantity_scale_factor' may also be relevant, as they handle setting the dimensions and scale factors for quantities, which are used in the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method.\n\nIn conclusion, the relevant code spans are within the 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py' file specifically the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method and potentially the 'Dimension' class within the 'sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py' file.",

Reviewing the new search results, there are additional methods in the 'Dimension' class that might be relevant, such as '_eval_power', '__mul__', '__rmul__', '__truediv__', '__rtruediv__', and '_from_dimensional_dependencies'. These methods could be involved in the dimension calculations that '_collect_factor_and_dimension' relies on.

Notably, the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within `UnitSystem` closely inspects various arithmetic operations including addition, which is relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the `__add__` method in the `Dimension` class is specifically designed to handle addition of dimensions, which is directly related to the issue of detecting equivalent dimensions during addition. Given these insights, it appears that the file context provided is comprehensive enough to understand how dimension equivalence is managed during addition operations, and where modifications might be needed to address the reported issue.",
