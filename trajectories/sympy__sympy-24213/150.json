This issue is demonstrated by a specific expression that raises a ValueError due to mismatched dimensions. The provided file context and search results contain relevant code spans that help understand and potentially address this issue. Specifically, the 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension' method is found in both the file context and the search results, providing a direct insight into its logic. Additionally, the 'Quantity' class in the search results provides methods related to setting dimensions and scale factors, which could be indirectly relevant to understanding how dimensions are managed and how the issue might be resolved. The analysis reveals that the said method explicitly checks for dimensional consistency in additions and raises an error if dimensions do not match. This seems to be the exact behavior described in the issue. The code spans provided should be sufficient for addressing the reported issue, as they cover the relevant functionality and the error-raising mechanism.",
