The error suggests that the function expects a certain dimension for a quantity but gets another, indicating a mismatch. This problem seems to be centered around the method's logic for collecting factors and dimensions when handling addition. To address this, the focus should be on refining how dimensions are collected and evaluated in the context of addition operations within the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method.",

The method is expected to detect equivalent dimensions when performing additions, but it seems to be failing and raising a `ValueError` instead. The provided search results include the definition of the `UnitSystem` class and its method `_collect_factor_and_dimension`. This method is particularly relevant as it directly deals with collecting factors and dimensions from expressions, which is central to the reported issue. The method iterates through different types of expressions (e.g., `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, etc.), processing each to extract and combine their factors and dimensions. Specifically, the method handles `Add` expressions by checking that all addends share the same dimension. If they do not, it raises a `ValueError`. This behavior matches the error described in the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` with the identifiers 'UnitSystem.__init__' and 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension'.",
