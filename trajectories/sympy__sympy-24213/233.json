The issue describes an error encountered when trying to add quantities with different but equivalent dimensions. The search results provide relevant code spans in two files:\n\n1. 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py':\n   - This file contains the implementation of the `UnitSystem` class, which includes the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. This method is central to the issue as it is supposed to handle the collection of factors and dimensions in a given expression. The method deals with different types of expressions (Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, Function, Dimension) and raises a ValueError when dimensions of added quantities do not match, which aligns with the error reported in the issue.\n\n2. 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py':\n   - This file contains the `Quantity` class and a deprecated static method `_collect_factor_and_dimension`. This method issues a deprecation warning and suggests using the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method instead, which directly references the method found in the first file. This provides additional context on how to correctly use the method in a modern, non-deprecated way.\n\nThe provided code spans directly address the issue by detailing the behavior of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in handling expression types and dimension validation, particularly in the case of Add expressions where it checks if the dimensions of added quantities match.\n\nGiven the relevance of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to the reported issue and the fact that the code spans include the method's implementation in a way that directly reflects the issue's description, I identify these spans as being highly relevant to the reported issue.",
