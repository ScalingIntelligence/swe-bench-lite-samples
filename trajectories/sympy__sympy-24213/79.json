The 'UnitSystem' class in 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py' is where the actual implementation of '_collect_factor_and_dimension' resides. This method is responsible for collecting factors and dimensions from an expression, and it is here where the error occurs when handling addition of quantities with different but equivalent dimensions.
