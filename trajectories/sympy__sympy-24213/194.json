The key to solving this issue lies in ensuring that the dimensions of the quantities involved in the expression `expr1` are correctly identified and handled. I will focus on identifying the relevant code spans that deal with dimension checking, setting quantity dimensions, and handling dimensional equivalencies. Specifically, I will search for methods that are involved in setting and retrieving quantity dimensions and scale factors, as well as those that handle dimension system management and equivalency checks.\n\nReviewing the search results, I observe several potentially relevant code spans:\n- `sympy.physics.units.dimensions` has methods `set_quantity_dimension`, `get_quantity_dimension`, `get_quantity_scale_factor`, and `equivalent_dims`.\n- `sympy.physics.units.systems.si` has methods that set quantity dimensions and scale factors for various units under the SI system.\n\nThese code spans seem to directly address the issue at hand because they manage how dimensions and scale factors are set and checked for various quantities. They also handle the creation and extension of dimension systems, which is crucial for identifying and managing dimensional equivalence during mathematical operations. Additionally, the spans dealing with setting dimensions and scale factors for specific units under the SI system provide insight into how the system is designed to handle measurements. \n\nMy analysis suggests that the identified code spans give a comprehensive view of how dimensions are managed within the sympy.physics.units module and are, therefore, relevant to the reported issue.",
