To resolve this, we need to investigate how dimensions are collected and compared. The error message indicates a mismatch between expected and actual dimensions, suggesting that the function does not account for cases where dimensions are equivalent but expressed differently. We should look into the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class and possibly related dimension handling functions.",

This leads to a ValueError when summing quantities of different dimensions but equivalent units. To address this, it's crucial to identify the implementation of '_collect_factor_and_dimension' within the 'Quantity' class and its corresponding method in the 'UnitSystem' class. From the search results, we find that 'Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension' has been deprecated and the functionality has moved to 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension'. This new method handles the collection of factors and dimensions for various expressions including Add, Mul, Pow, and Derivative. However, the issue might arise due to the handling of 'Add' expressions, where the dimensions of all addends must match. The reported issue likely occurs because the method checks for exact dimension matches, not equivalent dimensions as needed.",

This analysis matches the context provided in 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension', where the method explicitly checks and throws an error if dimensions of addends are not equal.
