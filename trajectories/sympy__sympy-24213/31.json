The error message indicates that the dimensions of the terms in the addition are not considered equivalent, leading to a `ValueError`. The search results include the `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` file, which contains the implementation of the `UnitSystem` class and the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` function. This function is crucial for analyzing expressions with quantities of different dimensions, and it directly deals with the error described in the issue. Additionally, the `_QuantityMapper` class, which is a superclass of `UnitSystem`, contains methods for setting and getting quantity dimensions, which are also relevant to the issue. The `Dimension` class and `DimensionSystem` class in the `sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py` file also provide underlying support for handling dimensions, making them relevant contexts for understanding how dimensions are managed in the system.
