The search results contain the implementation of the `UnitSystem` class and its `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. This is directly relevant to the reported issue as it involves the handling and detection of dimensions in arithmetic operations with quantities.

The identified code spans are from the `UnitSystem` class, specifically focusing on the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method where the issue arises. This method is critical as it collects the scale factor and dimension of an expression, which is essential for performing dimensional analysis and arithmetic operations with quantities.
