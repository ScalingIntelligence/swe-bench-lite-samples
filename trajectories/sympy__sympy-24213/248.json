Upon reviewing the search results, the code span identified with the ID 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension' directly addresses the method in question. It contains the logic for handling different types of expressions (Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, Function) and how they should be processed to collect their respective factors and dimensions.
