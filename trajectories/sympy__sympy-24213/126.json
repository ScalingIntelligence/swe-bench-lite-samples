The provided code example shows that when adding a quantity with velocity dimension to a quantity with acceleration*time dimension, an error is raised because the dimensions do not match, even though they should be equivalent from a physical perspective. The key to solving this issue is ensuring that 'collect_factor_and_dimension' properly identifies and treats equivalent dimensions as the same during addition operations. The search results contain the 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension' method which is responsible for the operation described in the issue. This method is where the dimensional checks and factor collection occur. Analyzing the method, it correctly handles multiplication, power, and derivative operations, but it lacks a mechanism to recognize equivalent dimensions during addition. Specifically, it only checks for exact matches of dimensions, which does not account for the possibility of dimensions being equivalent in a physical sense (e.g., velocity and acceleration*time). Therefore, the relevant code span that needs to be addressed to resolve the issue is the part where it raises an error upon finding dimensions that do not match exactly during addition. This suggests that the function should be modified to recognize equivalent dimensions before raising such an error. The identified span is crucial for understanding and addressing the reported issue.",
