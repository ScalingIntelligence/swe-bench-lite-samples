The provided code example and error traceback indicate that the function fails to recognize equivalent dimensions in the expression `a1*t1 + v1`, where `a1` and `v1` are quantities with dimensions of acceleration and velocity, respectively. The current file context includes parts of the `UnitSystem` class in `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`, which defines this function. The new search results provide additional context for the `UnitSystem` class, particularly the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. This method processes different types of expressions and the case for `Add` (addition) expressions is relevant to the issue. The method checks if all addends have the same dimension, and if not, raises a `ValueError`. The provided issue suggests that there is a need to detect and handle equivalent dimensions in addition, which might imply modifying the dimension checking logic in this method. Thus, the relevant parts of the code seem to be the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method and its handling of addition expressions.",
