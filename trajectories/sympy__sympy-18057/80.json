The error occurs due to `eval` attempting to parse strings from unknown objects, which can execute arbitrary code. The specific code snippet in question is 'Symbol('x').y' being passed to `eval`. The goal is to find all instances where `eval` is used in the `__eq__` method or related functions to ensure they are not parsing unsafe strings. Additionally, it would be wise to look into how strings from unknown objects are handled in the Equality class and related methods.",

The issue is demonstrated by creating a custom class with a __repr__ method that returns 'x.y', and then comparing an instance of this class to a Sympy Symbol 'x'. This results in an AttributeError because Sympy tries to eval the string representation of the object, leading to eval('Symbol(\"x\").y'), which fails as the Symbol object has no attribute 'y'. The traceback points to the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py which is where the problematic eval call occurs. Additionally, the __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py calls sympify(other), which ultimately leads to the eval_expr function being called. Therefore, the relevant files appear to be sympy/core/expr.py and sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py. The specific spans in these files that are relevant are those where the __eq__ method of the Expr class is defined and where the eval_expr function is used.",
