The `sympy/core/expr.py` file contains the `Expr.__eq__` method where the problematic behavior starts. This method attempts to sympify the other object and then compares it. The exact line of code where `sympify` is called is critical as it sets off the potential eval call.\n\n2. The `sympy/core/sympify.py` file contains the `sympify` function. This function is responsible for converting the other object into a SymPy object, which can lead to the parsing and potentially the eval call if the object's repr is a string that looks like a Python expression.\n\n3. The `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` file contains the `eval_expr` function, which directly uses `eval` to evaluate the input code. This is where the security issue occurs, as it attempts to interpret and execute the string representation produced by the custom object's `__repr__` method directly as Python code.\n\nThese spans of code are directly related to the vulnerability described in the reported issue.",
