The problem is exacerbated by the invocation of `eval_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, which attempts to evaluate a string representation of an unknown object that could be malicious. This is inherently dangerous and needs to be addressed immediately. Additionally, there's a related issue where an unknown object with a `repr` of 'x' incorrectly compares as equal to a Sympy symbol 'x'. This should be fixed to ensure proper comparison logic.

The traceback indicates the problem occurs in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` at the `eval_expr` function, where `eval` is used to evaluate the string representation of an object. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that the `__repr__` method of an unknown object can lead to incorrect comparisons with SymPy symbols. I will now identify the relevant code spans related to this issue.\n\nFirstly, I note the use of `eval` in the `eval_expr` function within `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. This function directly evaluates code strings, which is highly concerning for the security implications raised in the issue. Next, I consider the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`, part of the `Expr` class. This method attempts to sympify the `other` object and then compares them. The issue with unknown objects and their `__repr__` methods being evaluated arises here. Lastly, I examine `sympify` in `sympy/core/sympify.py` as it converts the input to a SymPy object, potentially leading to the problematic evaluation in `__eq__`.\n\nIn summary, I will mark code spans that correspond to the use of `eval` in the `eval_expr` function, the `__eq__` method in the `Expr` class, and the `sympify` function as relevant for addressing the reported issue. These sections are critical as they directly involve the evaluation of representations that are controllable by external objects, potentially leading to security and logical consistency issues.",
