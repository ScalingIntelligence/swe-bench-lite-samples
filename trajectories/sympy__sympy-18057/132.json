The relevant parts of the code include the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` and the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is also involved in the process of converting objects for comparison. Understanding how these methods interact is crucial for addressing the issue.
