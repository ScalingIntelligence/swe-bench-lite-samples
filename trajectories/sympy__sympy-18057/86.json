This behavior is problematic because it can lead to unintended side effects and security risks. The reproduction code demonstrates that passing strings produced by unknown objects into eval results in an AttributeError. This issue should be fixed by avoiding the use of eval in the comparison logic.\n\nThe search results show multiple files containing implementations of the __eq__ method across different classes in the SymPy codebase. Key files identified are:\n- sympy/core/expr.py: Contains the implementation of __eq__ for Expr class.\n- sympy/core/basic.py: Contains the implementation of __eq__ for Basic class.\n- sympy/core/function.py: Contains the implementation of __eq__ for UndefinedFunction, Lambda, and Subs classes.\n- sympy/core/numbers.py: Contains the implementation of __eq__ for Number, Float, Rational, and Integer classes.\n- sympy/core/exprtools.py: Contains the implementation of __eq__ for Factors class.\n- sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py: Contains the problematic eval_expr function where the eval is directly invoked.\n\nThese files and their respective __eq__ implementations should be examined and modified to ensure that eval is not used for comparing expressions.
