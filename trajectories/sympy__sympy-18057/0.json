This behavior is dangerous and should be rectified. The key files to investigate are those related to the Expr class and the sympify function, as they are central to the equality check and the sympification process. Additionally, the sympy_parser module contains the `eval_expr` function where the problematic `eval` call is located. To address this, we need to identify and modify these specific parts of the codebase.",
