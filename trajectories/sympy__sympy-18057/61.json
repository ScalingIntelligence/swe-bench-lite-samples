This behavior is triggered when comparing a `Symbol` object with an unknown object whose `repr` method returns a string that, when evaluated, causes an AttributeError or incorrect equality checks. The traceback indicates that the problem originates in the `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` file, specifically in the `eval_expr` function where `eval` is called directly. This function is likely the root cause of the issue, as it directly executes the potentially unsafe code. The `parse_expr` function calls `eval_expr`, and it might also be relevant in understanding how the problematic code string is generated. Therefore, the search results include relevant code spans around `eval_expr` and `parse_expr`.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves Sympy attempting to evaluate reprs in its __eq__ method, which is a significant security risk. The specific problem occurs when evaluating the equality check between a Sympy Symbol and an unknown object with a repr method that returns a string intended to be evaluated. This leads to an AttributeError when the evaluated string tries to access an attribute that does not exist on the Symbol object. The trace indicates that the error happens in the 'eval_expr' function in 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py', which is trying to evaluate the string 'Symbol ('x' ).y'. The solution requires altering how Sympy handles such cases in the __eq__ method to prevent unintended evaluation.\n\nIn the context of the search results, the relevant code spans are found in 'sympy/core/expr.py' where the __eq__ method of the Expr class is defined, and in 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py' where the 'stringify_expr', 'eval_expr', and 'parse_expr' functions handle the parsing and evaluation of expressions. These functions are central to how Sympy processes and evaluates expressions, making them critical for addressing the reported issue.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications should be made to ensure that repr strings from unknown objects are not inadvertently evaluated. This could involve using a safer method to convert objects to a Sympy-compatible form or enhancing the 'sympify' function to handle such cases more gracefully. Additionally, the __eq__ method should be modified to handle comparisons more robustly, avoiding direct evaluation of repr outputs from untrusted sources.",
