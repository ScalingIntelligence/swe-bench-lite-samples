This is problematic because passing strings produced by unknown objects into `eval` can lead to unexpected and harmful behavior. To address this, we need to locate where `eval` is being used in the equality check process. We should focus on the `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/core/sympify.py`, and `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` files, as these are likely places where the `__eq__` method and the `sympify` function are defined and implemented.",

This behavior is very bad as it potentially exposes the system to security risks. The key elements to look for in the codebase are the `__eq__` method and the `sympify` function which are responsible for converting the input to a SymPy object before comparison. The traceback provided indicates the problem occurs in the `sympify` function within sympy/core/sympify.py and in the `__eq__` method within sympy/core/expr.py. Specifically, the issue arises when `sympify` tries to convert the input object using `eval`, as evidenced by the line `expr = eval(code, global_dict, local_dict)`. The current search results include the `__eq__` method and the `sympify` function, which are directly related to handling equality comparisons and converting inputs to SymPy objects, respectively. This suggests that the provided code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue. Therefore, the search task appears to be partially complete as the relevant code spans have been identified.",

The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` processes the input using transformations and eventually calls `parse_expr` from `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. Upon examination, it's evident that this `parse_expr` function calls `eval_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, which in turn uses `eval`. Therefore, the critical part of the code dealing with the `eval` function is indeed present in the file context.
