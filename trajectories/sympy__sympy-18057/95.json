The primary concern is the safety and correctness of the `__eq__` method when dealing with such objects.\n\nInitially, there's no file context provided, so the focus is on the new search results. The analysis of these results shows that:\n\n1. In `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `Expr.__eq__` span contains the method where the equality check is performed. This method attempts to `sympify` the other object and then checks for equality, which could lead to the problematic `eval` usage if `sympify` fails.\n\n2. In `sympy/core/sympify.py`, the `sympify` span details how the `sympify` function processes inputs. This function is crucial as it is used in the `Expr.__eq__` method to convert the other object into a Sympy-compatible expression.\n\n3. In `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, the `eval_expr` span directly contains the usage of `eval` with strings. This is the exact location where the unsafe evaluation occurs, as indicated by the issue's traceback. The function `eval_expr` takes `code` (a string) and evaluates it, which is likely where the problematic evaluation of 'Symbol (\"x\" ).y' happens.\n\nGiven the issue's context and the provided search results, the relevant code spans are those in `Expr.__eq__` (where the issue can be triggered), in `sympify` (processing the input), and in `eval_expr` (where the unsafe `eval` is directly called). These spans are crucial for addressing the issue of unsafe evaluation in Sympy's `__eq__` method.\n\nThese identified spans should help in diagnosing and fixing the issue related to unsafe `eval` usage in Sympy's equality checks.",
