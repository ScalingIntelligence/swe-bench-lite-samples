The error occurs in the `eval_expr` function within `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, where the repr of the object is passed into `eval`. To fix this, it's necessary to identify and modify the `sympify` function or the `eval_expr` function to avoid using `eval` with potentially unsafe strings. The search results include the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which is responsible for converting objects to SymPy-compatible types and might be where the repr is being processed. Additionally, the `eval_expr` function is found, which directly uses `eval` on the repr output. Both of these functions are relevant to the issue and need to be addressed to ensure that SymPy does not inadvertently execute unsafe code during an equality check.",
