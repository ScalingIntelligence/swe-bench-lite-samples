The provided search results show key files and methods involved in this process. Specifically, the sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py converts the unknown object into a SymPy object, which is then handled by the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py. The eval function within eval_expr is the root cause of the vulnerability. It is crucial to modify or replace this behavior to ensure safety. Additionally, it's noted that the __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py is where the comparison occurs and where sympify is called. To address this issue, the relevant parts of the code include the sympify function and the eval_expr function, as well as the __eq__ method where the comparison takes place. These parts of the code need to be re-evaluated or updated to prevent unsafe use of eval.",

Furthermore, the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` directly uses `eval`, which is inherently dangerous and could be exploited if an attacker can control the input to this function.

Specifically, the issue involves evaluating repr strings from unknown objects in the equality check, which is a major security risk. The provided repro code demonstrates that passing a custom object whose repr is 'x.y' results in an AttributeError ('Symbol' object has no attribute 'y') when evaluated with SymPy's Symbol('x'). This is triggered in the eval_expr function within sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, where the repr string is passed into eval, leading to unsafe behavior.\n\nReviewing the current file context and new search results, it's evident that the main issue resides in the __eq__ method of the Expr class within sympy/core/expr.py. The method attempts to sympify the other object, which, if it has a vulnerable repr, can cause the unsafe eval function to be invoked within the sympify function. This is corroborated by the context showing that sympify uses the parse_expr function, which in turn calls eval_expr, leading to the problem. The search results confirm this chain: the __eq__ method of Expr uses the sympify function, which calls parse_expr then eval_expr, where eval is used. The solution should involve reconsidering the use of eval within the sympify process, especially concerning external object representations in a security-sensitive operation such as equality checks in symbolic computation libraries.\n\nFrom the search results and file context, the relevant spans are located in sympy/core/expr.py within the __eq__ method, sympy/core/sympify.py within the sympify function, and sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py within the eval_expr function.",

The primary concern is that the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` and the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` are used in a way that could evaluate arbitrary code. The current context has identified these functions as problematic. The new search results bring into focus additional sections of `sympy/core/sympify.py`, including `_convert_numpy_types`, `_sympify`, and `kernS`, but these appear to be related to type conversion and not directly address the issue with `eval`. The critical part to address is modifying the `__eq__` method in `Expr` class to avoid `eval` usage and ensuring `sympify` does not inadvertently convert unknown objects to expressions that can be evaluated.",

This process is handled by the `parse_expr` function from `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser`, which is called within `sympify`. This function can introduce security risks if the input strings are not sanitized properly, as it uses transformations to manipulate the input strings before evaluation. The `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` directly uses Python's `eval()` function to evaluate the parsed expression, which is particularly risky as it can execute arbitrary code if the input is not properly sanitized. This is a significant security concern and needs immediate attention to mitigate the risk of code injection vulnerabilities.",
