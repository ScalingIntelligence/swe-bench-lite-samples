This issue can result in AttributeErrors or incorrect comparisons because of the eval call. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase where this behavior occurs. The analysis of the provided search results shows that the code spans involving Expr.__eq__ and sympify in sympy/core/expr.py and sympy/core/sympify.py respectively are directly related to the issue. In addition, the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py is the exact location where the unsafe eval call is made, making it highly relevant. These spans show how objects are converted to Sympy expressions and compared, which directly relate to the behavior described in the issue. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to resolving the issue.",
