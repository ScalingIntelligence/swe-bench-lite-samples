The codeblock provided in the issue highlights a specific instance where an unknown object's repr is used in a comparison, causing an AttributeError. The analysis of the provided search results identifies key functions and methods where the problem might occur. The __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py attempts to sympify the other object, which is where the issue likely begins. The sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py is responsible for converting the input expression into a SymPy object, and it involves the parse_expr function from sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, which ultimately calls eval_expr. The eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py uses Python's eval function directly, which is unsafe and clearly where the risk is introduced, directly leading to the specific error reported. This analysis confirms that the eval_expr function and the __eq__ method are the central points of intervention for addressing the safety issue without directly altering the overall comparative logic of __eq__.",
