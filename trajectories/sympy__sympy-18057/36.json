This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    \"\"\"\n    is_sympy = getattr(a, '__sympy__', None)\n    if is_sympy is not None:\n        return a\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n    cls = getattr(a, \"__class__\", None)\n    if cls is None:\n        cls = type(a)  # Probably an old-style class\n    conv = converter.get(cls, None)\n    if conv is not None:\n        return conv(a)\n\n    for superclass in getmro(cls):\n        try:\n            return converter[superclass](a)\n        except KeyError:\n            continue\n\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a, locals=locals,\n                convert_xor=convert_xor, strict=strict, rational=rational,\n                evaluate=evaluate)\n\n    _sympy_ = getattr(a, \"_sympy_\", None)\n    if _sympy_ is not None:\n        try:\n            return a._sympy_()\n        # XXX: Catches AttributeError: 'SympyConverter' object has no\n        # attribute 'tuple'\n        # This is probably a bug somewhere but for now we catch it here.\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        flat = getattr(a, \"flat\", None)\n        if flat is not None:\n            shape = getattr(a, \"shape\", None)\n            if shape is not None:\n                from ..tensor.array import Array\n                return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                coerced = coerce(a)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                continue\n            # XXX: AttributeError only needed here for Py2\n            except AttributeError:\n                continue\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerced)\n            except SympifyError:\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.

In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    \"\"\"\n    is_sympy = getattr(a, '__sympy__', None)\n    if is_sympy is not None:\n        return a\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n    cls = getattr(a, \"__class__\", None)\n    if cls is None:\n        cls = type(a)  # Probably an old-style class\n    conv = converter.get(cls, None)\n    if conv is not None:\n        return conv(a)\n\n    for superclass in getmro(cls):\n        try:\n            return converter[superclass](a)\n        except KeyError:\n            continue\n\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a, locals=locals,\n                convert_xor=convert_xor, strict=strict, rational=rational,\n                evaluate=evaluate)\n\n    _sympy_ = getattr(a, \"_sympy_\", None)\n    if _sympy_ is not None:\n        try:\n            return a._sympy_()\n        # XXX: Catches AttributeError: 'SympyConverter' object has no\n        # attribute 'tuple'\n        # This is probably a bug somewhere but for now we catch it here.\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        flat = getattr(a, \"flat\", None)\n        if flat is not None:\n            shape = getattr(a, \"shape\", None)\n            if shape is not None:\n                from ..tensor.array import Array\n                return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                coerced = coerce(a)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                continue\n            # XXX: AttributeError only needed here for Py2\n            except AttributeError:\n                continue\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerced)\n            except SympifyError:\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.
