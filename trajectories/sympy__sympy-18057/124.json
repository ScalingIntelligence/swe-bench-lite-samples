This practice is dangerous and should be avoided, especially since it can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior during equality checks. The issue has been confirmed with a reproducible example, where a custom class with a __repr__ method returning 'x.y' causes an AttributeError when compared with a Sympy Symbol 'x'. The traceback points to the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, which is where the problematic code uses eval. Additionally, the __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py attempts to sympify the 'other' object by calling sympify(other), which leads to the invocation of the problematic eval_expr function. Given the critical nature of this issue, it is crucial to identify and avoid the use of eval in such contexts and to properly handle unknown objects without invoking their string representations. The search results confirm the presence of the relevant code spans. In sympy/core/expr.py, the __eq__ method is found and within it, the call to sympify(other) is identified, which is the point of entry leading to the eval issue. The actual code segment using eval is found in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py under the eval_expr function. With both these sections identified, the next steps involve fixing the __eq__ method to avoid using eval and implementing a safer alternative for handling sympification of objects, especially those with unknown string representations.",
