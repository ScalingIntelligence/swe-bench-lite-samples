This occurs within the `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` file, specifically in the `eval_expr` function. This function uses `eval` on a string that can come from unknown sources, which is unsafe. By examining the code spans provided in the search results, it's clear that the `eval_expr` function is where the problematic `eval` call resides, making this span highly relevant to addressing the issue. To fix the problem, the use of `eval` should be replaced with a safer method to parse and compare expressions, ensuring that unknown string inputs do not lead to code execution. The function `eval_expr` and its usage across related files need a comprehensive review and potential re-implementation to avoid such security risks.",
