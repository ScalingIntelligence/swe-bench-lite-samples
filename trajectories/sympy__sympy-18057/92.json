        "message": "The search returned 17 results. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nAfter analyzing the reported issue, the key concern is the inappropriate use of `eval` within the `__eq__` method in the Sympy library, which is identified to be present in the `sympy/core/sympify.py` file. The reported issue specifically points out the problematic line `expr = eval(code, global_dict, local_dict)` where `code` comes from an untrusted `__repr__` method of an unknown object, leading to a security vulnerability and unexpected behavior. This issue affects the `sympify` function which is used in the `__eq__` method of the `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py`. Given the severity of using `eval` with untrusted input, it is crucial to identify all instances where this might be occurring to ensure the library's safety and reliability. The provided search results include various `__eq__` method implementations across different Sympy modules such as `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, etc. Each of these should be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not inadvertently use `eval` or any other potentially dangerous operations when comparing objects. However, the specific problematic `eval` usage as reported in the issue is not directly visible in the search results, indicating a need for deeper inspection of the involved files and methods to locate and fix this critical issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a critical security flaw where Sympy's __eq__ method attempts to evaluate representations (repr) of objects, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This behavior is particularly problematic when dealing with unknown or untrusted objects, as their repr might contain malicious code. The issue is clearly demonstrated in the provided repro code, where a custom class C with a __repr__ method that returns 'x.y' causes an AttributeError when compared to a Sympy Symbol 'x'. The traceback points to the 'sympify' function attempting to parse and evaluate the string 'x.y' from the repr of C, leading to the error 'Symbol object has no attribute 'y'. Additionally, the issue extends to cases where an unknown object with a repr of 'x' unintentionally compares as equal to a Sympy symbol 'x'. This reinforces the need to avoid evaluating reprs for determining equality in Sympy. From the search results, the 'sympify' function in 'sympy/core/sympify.py' and the __eq__ method in 'sympy/core/expr.py' are identified as highly relevant. The 'sympify' function is responsible for converting non-Sympy objects into Sympy objects, which involves parsing and potentially evaluating strings from their repr. The __eq__ method in 'Expr' calls 'sympify' on the 'other' object, leading to the evaluation of the repr of 'C' in the repro code. These two parts are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue.",
