The primary concern is that using 'eval' on user-provided strings is insecure and can lead to errors. The provided search results include relevant sections of the SymPy codebase, notably in 'sympify.py' and 'sympy_parser.py'. The 'sympify' function in 'sympify.py' is responsible for converting an object to a SymPy expression, and it ultimately calls 'parse_expr' which in turn calls 'eval_expr' in 'sympy_parser.py'. This 'eval_expr' function directly uses 'eval' on the provided code, which is the root cause of the issue. It is crucial to modify these sections to prevent the use of 'eval' with potentially unsafe input. Since the key problematic sections (the 'sympify' function and the 'eval_expr' function) have been identified, the search for relevant code spans can be considered complete.",
