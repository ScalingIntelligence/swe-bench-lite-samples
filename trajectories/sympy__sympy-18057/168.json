This evaluation occurs within the 'sympify' function in 'sympy/core/sympify.py', where it parses and evaluates expressions. The direct eval call can be found in 'eval_expr' within 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py'. Specifically, the issue is triggered when an unknown object's representation is passed into this evaluation process, causing unintended side effects. The identified code spans are crucial as they highlight the exact point of failure and the broader context in which the evaluation occurs. The solution involves reconsidering how Sympy handles evaluations during equality checks to ensure safety and correctness. Relevant code spans include the 'sympify' function and its interaction with 'eval_expr', as well as the handling of numpy types in '_convert_numpy_types' which could also potentially impact the evaluation process due to type coercion during sympification.",
