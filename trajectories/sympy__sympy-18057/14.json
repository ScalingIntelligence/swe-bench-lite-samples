This can lead to severe security risks and unexpected behavior. The provided search results indicate key components in Sympy's core and parsing modules that are involved in the process of converting objects into Sympy expressions. Specifically, the 'eval_expr' function in 'sympy_parser.py' is directly responsible for evaluating string expressions using 'eval', which aligns with the issue's description. Additionally, the 'parse_expr' function handles the parsing of expressions and directly calls 'eval_expr', making it another crucial component to address the issue. Therefore, both 'eval_expr' and 'parse_expr' functions in 'sympy_parser.py' are relevant for addressing the reported security issue.",
