This is dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code, leading to potential security breaches or unexpected behavior. The issue is particularly severe since it occurs during an equality check, which should be a safe operation.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans can be identified as follows:\n\n1. sympy/core/expr.py - This file contains the `Expr` class which includes the `__eq__` method. The method attempts to `sympify` the other object, which can lead to the problematic `eval` call if the other object's `__repr__` method returns a string that `eval` can interpret.\n\n2. sympy/core/sympify.py - This file contains the `sympify` function, which is responsible for converting the other object into a Sympy-compatible object. The function uses transformations and ultimately attempts to parse and evaluate the string representation of the object, handling any resulting exceptions.\n\n3. sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py - This file contains the `eval_expr` function, which directly uses `eval` to evaluate the string representation of the object. This is where the actual security risk arises.\n\nThese code spans are critical because they directly relate to the core functionality affected by the issue: converting and comparing objects within Sympy. The use of `eval` within these methods needs to be replaced with a safer alternative to avoid the security risk and unexpected behavior.",
