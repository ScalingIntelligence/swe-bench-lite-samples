This behavior is triggered when comparing a Sympy Symbol with an object whose __repr__ method returns a string that Sympy attempts to evaluate. The issue can be reproduced with a custom class C whose __repr__ method returns 'x.y', leading to an AttributeError when Sympy's Symbol is compared with an instance of C. The trace shows that the problematic line is in the 'eval_expr' function within the 'sympy_parser.py' file, where 'eval' is directly invoked on a code string. In the provided search results, the 'Expr.__eq__' method in 'sympy/core/expr.py' attempts to sympify the 'other' object, which likely leads to the call to 'eval_expr'. This method's handling of the comparison with non-Sympy objects seems relevant to the issue. Additionally, the 'eval_expr' function directly responsible for the 'eval' call is found in 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py'. This function's code span is directly related to the vulnerable behavior described in the issue.",
