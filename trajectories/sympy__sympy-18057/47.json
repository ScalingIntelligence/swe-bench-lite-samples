This behavior is dangerous and needs to be addressed in the __eq__ method of Sympy's Expr class or the sympify function, and it may also relate to the eval_expr function in the sympy_parser module. Focus should be on identifying and revising these specific methods to prevent the use of eval and ensure safe equality checks.",

This is dangerous and should be avoided. The key problem is with the `sympify` function, which attempts to convert the object to a Sympy expression and then uses `eval` on the repr of the object. We need to identify the relevant code spans that handle this conversion and the equality checks. The relevant code spans are:\n\n1. `sympy/core/basic.py` - Contains the `__eq__` method for the `Basic` class.\n2. `sympy/core/sympify.py` - Contains the `sympify` function which converts objects to Sympy expressions.\n3. `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` - Contains the `eval_expr` function which uses `eval` on the repr of the object.\n4. `sympy/core/expr.py` - Contains the `__eq__` method for the `Expr` class.\n\nThis set of code spans should provide a comprehensive view of the problem areas related to the issue.
