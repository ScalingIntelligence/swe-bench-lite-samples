This is risky because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, leading to security vulnerabilities. The problem is particularly critical when comparing an unknown object with a Sympy symbol. The provided trace indicates that the issue arises in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` where `eval_expr` is called, attempting to evaluate the `__repr__` output of the unknown object. To address this, we need to identify where in the codebase the comparison logic with `eval` is located and how `sympify` interacts with it.",

This is dangerous as it can lead to unintended execution of arbitrary code. The relevant part of the issue is the line where `eval` is called in `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser.eval_expr`. From the provided search results, we need to focus on the `Expr` class and its `__eq__` method and the `sympify` function which is called within that method. The `__eq__` method should be modified to avoid evaluating `repr` strings of unknown objects. The search results include the `Expr` class definition with the `__eq__` method, which currently tries to convert the other object to a Sympy object using `sympify`. This suggests that the `Expr` class and its `__eq__` method are the primary areas to address. The `sympify` function's role in this process also indicates that any changes might influence this function. In addition, the traceback indicates a problem when `sympify` is used within `Expr.__eq__`, specifically in parsing the expression. Therefore, these parts of the codebase are crucial for addressing the issue.",

This ensures that the comparison does not inadvertently trigger the evaluation of arbitrary code.
