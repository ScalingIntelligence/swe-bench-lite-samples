The key points are: 1. The __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py likely triggers the problematic behavior by attempting to sympify the 'other' object. 2. The sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py might be involved, as it converts the 'other' to a Sympy object. 3. The eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py is the location where the actual eval call is made, leading to the error. Specific files to focus on are sympy/core/expr.py, sympy/core/sympify.py, and sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, especially around the __eq__ and sympify methods.",

This behavior poses significant risks, especially since an equality check should not lead to such potentially dangerous operations. The trace provided indicates that the `__eq__` method fails due to an `AttributeError` when handling an unknown object with a repr method that returns 'x.y'. This leads to an attempt to evaluate 'Symbol('x').y', which triggers the error because 'Symbol' objects do not have an attribute 'y'. The provided code spans show sections of the `Expr.__eq__` method from `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `sympify` function from `sympy/core/sympify.py`, and the `eval_expr` function from `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. These sections are highly relevant to the issue as they directly involve the problematic `eval` call and the mechanics of how objects are sympified and compared for equality. Identifying these specific spans is crucial for addressing the issue since they are central to the vulnerability.",
