Additionally, the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is implicated in converting the input to a Sympy object, which may lead to the execution of unsafe code. The `__eq__` method in `Expr` class within `sympy/core/expr.py` and `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py` also play roles in this process by comparing objects after they have been sympified.

This function processes the input and is sensitive to the form of the input, particularly if it's a string that might lead to potential evaluation issues if it's from an untrusted source. The `sympify` function internally uses `parse_expr` from `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser`, which subsequently uses `eval_expr`. The `eval_expr` function directly calls `eval` on the input code, which can be dangerous if the code is controlled by an attacker. The investigation should focus on the `sympify` function and tracking how the input flows through the process to ensure that no untrusted input directly reaches the `eval` function. Particularly, the handling of strings and the logic determining when to parse or evaluate strings need careful scrutiny.",

The issue is particularly concerning as it can lead to AttributeError due to incorrect evaluations. The current context shows that the issue might be rooted in the __eq__ method of the Expr class in 'sympy/core/expr.py' and the eval_expr function in 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py'. The new search results show additional context around the sympify function and its handling of different types, including numpy types, which could be relevant if the issue extends to different data types beyond standard Python objects. The presence of eval in the eval_expr function is particularly concerning, as it directly relates to the reported issue. It's also worth noting the presence of _convert_numpy_types, which could be a potential entry point for similar issues with numpy types. Given these findings, it seems that the eval_expr function and possibly related functions like sympify need to be carefully reviewed and potentially refactored to avoid using eval on potentially unsafe input.",
