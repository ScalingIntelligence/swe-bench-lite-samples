The core problem appears to stem from the use of the eval function within the eval_expr and parse_expr methods in the sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py file. This usage of eval is dangerous as it attempts to evaluate strings produced by unknown objects, leading to AttributeError when such strings contain invalid attribute accesses (e.g., 'x.y' accessing 'y' on a Symbol object 'x'). Further, this exposes Sympy to potential security risks from arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. Based on the repro code and the detailed error trace provided, it's clear that the eval usage in the eval_expr method is the direct cause of the observed behavior. Thus, for addressing this issue, the focus should be on the eval_expr and parse_expr methods in the sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py file. Specifically, identifying safer alternatives to the current usage of eval or implementing stricter validation and sanitization on the input strings to prevent unsafe code execution.",
