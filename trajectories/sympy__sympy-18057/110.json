This occurs in the context of comparing a SymPy symbol with an unknown object that has a `__repr__` method returning `x.y`, leading to an `AttributeError` because `x.y` is incorrectly interpreted as an attribute access on the Symbol object. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. Specifically, the `eval_expr` function that directly uses `eval` to evaluate the `code` string is at fault here. Additionally, the `parse_expr` function is responsible for preparing the code that goes into `eval_expr`. Since the issue requires a change in the way SymPy evaluates inputs during comparison operations, these two functions are definitely relevant. Therefore, both spans `eval_expr` and `parse_expr` are critical to the solution of this issue.",
