This directly points out the dangerous usage of eval in the context of __eq__ method in Expr class, which is trying to sympify the 'other' object and compare it with itself. Additionally, the search results do not provide a direct solution or alternative to the usage of eval in the codebase.\n\nThe provided search results include the relevant code spans in sympy/core/sympify.py and sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, which are focused on the sympify and eval_expr functions. These functions are pertinent to the issue because they deal with converting other types into Sympy expressions and evaluating string expressions respectively. However, while these functions are involved in the problematic behavior, they do not provide a direct remedy to the problem of using eval in a potentially unsafe manner.\n\nGiven the current search results, it is evident that the issue of evaluating reprs in the __eq__ method is a serious concern and must be addressed immediately to avoid security and usability problems. However, the search task is not complete as there is no code provided in the results that would fix the issue.
