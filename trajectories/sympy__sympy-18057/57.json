This poses a significant security risk and should be corrected. The trace provides insight into where the problematic code resides: sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py contains a function eval_expr that directly involves eval. Additionally, sympy/core/sympify.py and sympy/core/expr.py seem to be involved in the chain leading to this evaluation. Given this, the search should focus on these specific files and functions to identify the exact location and nature of the issue for a targeted fix.",

This practice is dangerous and should be immediately addressed. The provided traceback indicates that the error occurs during the execution of `eval_expr` in 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py'. Specifically, the code span where `eval` is called on the string 'Symbol ('x' ).y' is of utmost relevance. Additionally, the `sympify` function in 'sympy/core/sympify.py' is involved in the conversion process that leads to this unsafe evaluation. Furthermore, the `__eq__` method within the 'Expr' class in 'sympy/core/expr.py' is where the comparison logic is implemented, and it's crucial to ensure this method does not lead to unsafe evaluation. Given these findings, the immediate task is to refactor these identified areas to avoid unsafe practices. This involves understanding the complete context in which these evaluations occur and ensuring that all related methods are thoroughly reviewed to prevent similar vulnerabilities.",
