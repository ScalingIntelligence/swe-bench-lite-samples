This behavior is dangerous as it can lead to potentially harmful code execution. The traceback provided indicates that the problematic code resides within the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, where `eval` is directly invoked on the representation of the object, which can be controlled by the user. This is evident from the line `expr = eval(code, global_dict, local_dict)` within the `eval_expr` function. The `parse_expr` function, also located in the same file, is responsible for parsing and evaluating expressions and is likely where the error begins propagating. Given the severity of the issue, it is crucial to identify these specific sections of the code to address the problem by possibly re-evaluating the use of `eval` and finding safer alternatives for expression parsing and evaluation.",
