The issue is that certain objects, whose `__repr__` implementation might return strings that are not valid for evaluation in a mathematical context, cause an AttributeError when compared to a SymPy symbol. This problematic behavior occurs because the `sympify` function attempts to evaluate the string representation of the object. To address this, it is necessary to avoid evaluating the `__repr__` output of unknown objects. The relevant sections of code are those where the `__eq__` method is defined for the `Expr` and `Basic` classes, as well as the `eval_expr` function in `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser`, which is responsible for evaluating the expression. These parts of the code need to be modified to prevent the unsafe `eval` usage.",

The key issue is that the method uses 'eval' on the string representation of objects, which is dangerous. The relevant code spans in the existing file context indicate the presence of the __eq__ method within the Expr class in sympy/core/expr.py. This method attempts to convert the 'other' object to a SymPy object using sympify and then compares the two for equality. The search results include the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, which is likely where the actual 'eval' call is made. It is evident that the current implementation of __eq__ might be causing this unwanted evaluation. The identified spans in the search results directly pertain to the reported issue as they involve the evaluation of expressions and the conversion of strings to expressions using 'eval' within the parse_expr function. These findings are crucial for addressing the issue to ensure that SymPy does not inadvertently execute potentially harmful code during equality checks.",
