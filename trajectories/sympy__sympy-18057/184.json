The traceback indicates that the error occurs in sympy/core/expr.py under the __eq__ method of class Expr. 4. Additionally, the trace leads to sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py where the function eval_expr is defined, containing the actual call to eval that is causing the issue. 5. These two files and associated methods are the central focus as they directly relate to the problem described in the issue. 6. Specifically, the spans 'Expr.__eq__' and 'eval_expr' are of high relevance as they contain the code that handles comparisons and the execution of potentially unsafe code using eval respectively. 7.
