This behavior is dangerous and can lead to security risks and unexpected errors, as demonstrated in the provided repro code. The traceback indicates that the problematic code is located in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, specifically in the `eval_expr` function where `eval` is directly called with potentially unsafe input. The `eval_expr` function is responsible for evaluating the expression provided as a string, which in this case includes a call to `eval` with the contents of the `code` variable. This variable is derived from the `repr` method of an unknown object, leading to the issue when the object's `repr` is a string that Sympy tries to evaluate. The `parse_expr` function also appears relevant as it calls `eval_expr`. Both these functions are likely candidates for fixing the underlying issue by preventing the dangerous use of `eval`.",
