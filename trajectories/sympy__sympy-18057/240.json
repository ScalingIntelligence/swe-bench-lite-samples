This occurs in the `eval_expr` function within the `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` file when trying to evaluate strings produced by unknown objects, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The relevant code spans that need to be addressed include the `eval_expr` function, which contains the line `expr = eval(code, global_dict, local_dict)` responsible for evaluating the string representation of the object. Additionally, the `parse_expr` function, which calls `eval_expr`, needs to be reviewed to ensure that it does not inadvertently expose this vulnerability. Furthermore, the context provided indicates a related issue where an unknown object's repr of `x` incorrectly compares as equal to a Sympy symbol `x`, which suggests that the logic used to compare objects in Sympy's __eq__ method is flawed and needs correction to avoid such miscomparisons.",
