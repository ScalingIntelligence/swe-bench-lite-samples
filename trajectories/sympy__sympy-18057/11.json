The relevant spans of code identified from the search results involve the __eq__ method in the `Expr` class and the `eval_expr` function in `sympy_parser.py`. These spans are critical because they directly relate to the reported issue. The `__eq__` method in the `Expr` class is where the comparison is made, and the `eval_expr` function is where the unsafe `eval` call is made. Additional spans from `sympy/core/sympify.py` are also relevant, as they deal with the sympification process which precedes the `eval_expr` call.",
