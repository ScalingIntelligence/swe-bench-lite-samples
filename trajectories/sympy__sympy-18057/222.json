The issue is particularly problematic because it occurs during an equality check, which should not trigger such behavior. The trace provided shows that the problematic line is `eval_expr(code, local_dict, global_dict)`, where `code` is a string that gets evaluated. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that are related to the __eq__ method or the sympify function where this issue might be occurring. After reviewing the search results, it's clear that the `sympy/core/expr.py` file contains the __eq__ method for the `Expr` class, which is attempting to sympify the `other` object. The `sympy/core/sympify.py` file contains the implementation of the `sympify` function, which eventually leads to the evaluation of the code string. Also, the `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` file contains the `eval_expr` function directly performing the `eval` operation, which is the root cause of the issue.
