The issue specifically points to the `__eq__` method in the `Expr` class and the `eval_expr` function in `sympy_parser.py`. The provided search results include the `Expr` class definition with the `__eq__` method and the `eval_expr` function, both of which are directly related to the issue. The `Expr.__eq__` span shows that the `other` object is sympified and then compared. The `eval_expr` span shows the invocation of `eval`, which is the core problem described in the issue. Additionally, the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is also relevant as it is involved in the process of converting the `other` object to a Sympy object before the comparison. These spans together cover the necessary parts of the codebase where the fix needs to be applied to address the issue. Therefore, the search task is complete with these identified spans.",
