The traceback provided indicates that the error occurs in the __eq__ method of the Expr class in sympy/core/expr.py. I examined the Expr class and its methods, particularly focusing on the __eq__ method. In this method, the other object is sympified, which could lead to the eval issue if the object's repr is used in a way that triggers dangerous evaluation. The relevant code spans are within the Expr class, specifically the __eq__ method.\n\nFor the sympy/core/sympify.py file, the sympify function is relevant as it is used within the Expr class's __eq__ method to convert the other object into a SymPy-compatible type. The sympify function's purpose aligns well with the requirement to understand how objects are converted to SymPy types, which is crucial for identifying where the dangerous eval behavior might be initiated.

The issue is triggered when an unknown object with a non-standard __repr__ method is compared to a SymPy Symbol. This causes SymPy to attempt to evaluate the string representation of the unknown object using 'eval', resulting in an AttributeError. The relevant code spans from the initial report include the __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py and the sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py. The new search results contain additional relevant code, particularly the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, which is directly involved in evaluating the problematic string representation. The parse_expr function also appears relevant as it calls eval_expr. The search task is complete as these code spans provide a comprehensive view of the code involved in handling the equality check and the evaluation of expressions, which are central to the reported issue.",
