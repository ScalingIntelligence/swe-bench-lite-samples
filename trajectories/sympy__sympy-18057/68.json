The traceback provided points to specific functions and files where the problematic code resides: sympy.core.expr.Expr.__eq__, sympy.core.sympify.sympify, and sympy.parsing.sympy_parser.eval_expr. It is crucial to locate and analyze the code within these functions to understand how repr strings are being processed and why eval is being used. Additionally, the related issue indicates that a repr string 'x' incorrectly compares as equal to a Sympy symbol x, which suggests deeper issues with how equality checks in Sympy are being handled. The immediate focus should be on identifying if the repr strings from unknown objects are being evaluated unsafely and determining why and how they are being compared to symbolic objects.",
