This results in an `AttributeError` because the `repr` of the unknown object is being evaluated as code, leading to unsafe behavior. The key files identified as relevant are `expr.py`, `sympify.py`, and `sympy_parser.py`, which handle expressions, sympification, and parsing, respectively. The focus should be on the `__eq__` method in `expr.py` and the `sympify` function in `sympify.py`, along with the `eval_expr` function in `sympy_parser.py` where the error occurs. More specifically, the `eval_expr` function in `sympy_parser.py` calls `eval` on the string representation of the object, which is unsafe. The goal is to identify and modify the specific lines where `eval` is used to implement a safer alternative.",

This is a security risk as well as a functional bug. The traceback indicates that the problematic code is in the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, where it passes the unknown object to `parse_expr`, which eventually calls `eval_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. This `eval_expr` function directly calls `eval` on the string representation of the object, leading to the error. It seems that the `sympify` function should validate the input more strictly to prevent such issues. The `eval_expr` function, in particular, needs to be reviewed to ensure that it does not execute unsafe code. Additionally, the 'convert_equals_sign' function in the same file `sympy_parser.py` could be examined for safety when dealing with potential repr strings from unknown objects.",

Specifically, the issue arises when an object's `__repr__` method returns a string which, when passed to `eval`, causes an AttributeError because it attempts to access an attribute that does not exist on a `Symbol` object. Reviewing the provided file contexts and search results, particularly the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, `eval_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, and `Expr.__eq__` in `sympy/core/expr.py`, reveals critical functions where this behavior can occur.\n\nIn `sympify`, the function calls `parse_expr` from `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` which eventually leads to `eval_expr`, where the `eval` function is used. This is where the problematic evaluation takes place based on the input, potentially from `__repr__` of an unknown object. The `Expr.__eq__` method attempts to sympify the other object and then check for equality. This chain of calls from `__eq__` via `sympify` to ultimately `eval` in `eval_expr` is the root cause of the issue.\n\nIdentified relevant spans include `Expr.__eq__` in `sympy/core/expr.py` where the equality check initiates, `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` which processes and potentially evaluates the input, and `eval_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` where the `eval` function is explicitly called, leading to the observed error. All these spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue.",
