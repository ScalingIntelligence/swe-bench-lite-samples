The trace points to the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` as the location where the problematic `eval` is called. The search results confirm this by providing the relevant code spans in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` where the `eval` invocation occurs. The `eval_expr` function notably uses `eval` on the `code` argument, which can come from unknown sources and is unsafe. Therefore, it's imperative to focus on fixing this function to prevent such unsafe evaluation. Additionally, the `parse_expr` function invokes `eval_expr`, showcasing the broader context in which the issue resides. Both the `parse_expr` and `eval_expr` functions are highly relevant to address the reported issue.

The issue particularly focuses on how SymPy's `sympify` function processes these representations, leading to an attempt to access an attribute 'y' on a `Symbol` object that doesn't exist. In the context of the provided file 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py', the relevant code spans are `eval_expr` and `parse_expr`. These functions are responsible for evaluating and parsing expressions respectively, and directly contribute to the behavior described in the issue. The `eval_expr` function uses `eval` to evaluate the code, which is clearly where the security risk originates. Additionally, `parse_expr` prepares the code for evaluation and calls `eval_expr`. Ensuring these functions handle input more safely should address the issue. Specifically, the solution might involve reformulating how string representations are processed to avoid direct `eval` or adding checks to verify that the input is safe for evaluation before proceeding.",
