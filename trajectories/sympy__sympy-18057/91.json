The relevant code spans from the search results indicate where this problematic behavior occurs. In 'sympy/core/expr.py', there is the __eq__ method which attempts to sympify the 'other' object. This leads to the problematic part in 'sympy/core/sympify.py' where the 'sympify' function is defined. The critical part that uses eval directly is in 'sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py' in the 'eval_expr' function. This function takes a string expression (which might come from an unknown object and its repr method) and evaluates it directly using 'eval', leading to the observed unsafe behavior. The 'parse_expr' function also uses 'eval_expr', indicating a broader usage context. I will focus on identifying code spans around these functions to address the issue.",

In the following,\n    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n    interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises\n    an error when used improperly:\n\n    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    bitcount(42)\n    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n    O(x)\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    TypeError: unbound method...\n\n    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_\n    >>> ns = {}\n    >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\n    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n    6\n\n    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n    three of the following are possibilities:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol\n    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n    >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n    O + 1\n\n    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\n    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\n    names that are defined in abc).\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n    >>> _clash1\n    {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}\n    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n    I & Q\n\n    Strict\n    ------\n\n    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other\n    cases, a SympifyError is raised.\n\n    >>> print(sympify(None))\n    None\n    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    SympifyError: SympifyError: None\n\n    Evaluation\n    ----------\n\n    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\n    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\n    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.\n\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n    19/3\n    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n    2**2/3 + 5\n\n    Extending\n    ---------\n\n    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n\n    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n    when the input is a string.\n\n    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n    some use.

You can do that even to\n    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n    >>> class MyList1(object):\n    ...     def __iter__(self):\n    ...         yield 1\n    ...         yield 2\n    ...         return\n    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n    Matrix([\n    [1],\n    [2]])\n\n    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n    ``converter`` global dictionary.

In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n    -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n\n    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n    -1\n    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n    >>> sympify(s)\n    -1\n    >>> kernS(s)\n    -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n\n    \"\"\"\n    is_sympy = getattr(a, '__sympy__', None)\n    if is_sympy is not None:\n        return a\n\n    if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n    cls = getattr(a, \"__class__\", None)\n    if cls is None:\n        cls = type(a)  # Probably an old-style class\n    conv = converter.get(cls, None)\n    if conv is not None:\n        return conv(a)\n\n    for superclass in getmro(cls):\n        try:\n            return converter[superclass](a)\n        except KeyError:\n            continue\n\n    if cls is type(None):\n        if strict:\n            raise SympifyError(a)\n        else:\n            return a\n\n    if evaluate is None:\n        if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n            evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n        else:\n            evaluate = True\n\n    # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n    # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n    if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n        import numpy as np\n        if np.isscalar(a):\n            return _convert_numpy_types(a, locals=locals,\n                convert_xor=convert_xor, strict=strict, rational=rational,\n                evaluate=evaluate)\n\n    _sympy_ = getattr(a, \"_sympy_\", None)\n    if _sympy_ is not None:\n        try:\n            return a._sympy_()\n        # XXX: Catches AttributeError: 'SympyConverter' object has no\n        # attribute 'tuple'\n        # This is probably a bug somewhere but for now we catch it here.\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n\n    if not strict:\n        # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n        # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n        flat = getattr(a, \"flat\", None)\n        if flat is not None:\n            shape = getattr(a, \"shape\", None)\n            if shape is not None:\n                from ..tensor.array import Array\n                return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n\n    if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n        for coerce in (float, int):\n            try:\n                coerced = coerce(a)\n            except (TypeError, ValueError):\n                continue\n            # XXX: AttributeError only needed here for Py2\n            except AttributeError:\n                continue\n            try:\n                return sympify(coerced)\n            except SympifyError:\n                continue\n\n    if strict:\n        raise SympifyError(a)\n\n    if iterable(a):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n    if isinstance(a, dict):\n        try:\n            return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n                rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n        except TypeError:\n            # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n            pass\n\n    # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n    # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n    # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n    # anything to SymPy expression).\n    #\n    # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n    # and try to parse it.
