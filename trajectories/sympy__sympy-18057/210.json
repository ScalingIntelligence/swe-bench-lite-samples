Additionally, examining expr.py for the __eq__ method definition and sympify.py which is responsible for sympifying objects before comparison could be beneficial. Also, considering repr.py since it directly relates to how objects are represented as strings, though the issue does not seem to be here, it's part of the chain.",

The key problem is that a string representation of an object, which could be arbitrary, is being evaluated in the `__eq__` method. Specifically, the issue mentions the line where 'eval' is used: ````expr = eval(code, global_dict, local_dict)````. This line is found in the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. Additionally, the `__eq__` method in the `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` tries to sympify the other object, which could lead to the dangerous `eval` call if the other object has a repr that is not safe to evaluate. A related issue is when an unknown object with repr 'x' incorrectly compares equal to a Sympy symbol 'x', which also points to deeper issues in the sympify and comparison logic.",

This function attempts to evaluate code generated by the `__repr__` method of unknown objects, which is dangerous and triggers unexpected behavior. The issue specifically points to the line where `eval` is called, and the traceback indicates that this code is generated from the `__repr__` method of a custom class. Additionally, the issue mentions a related problem where an unknown object whose `repr` is `'x'` incorrectly compares as equal to a SymPy symbol `x`. This points to potential issues in the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`. Given the reported issue and the search results, it's essential to focus on the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` and the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` to identify relevant code spans.

It's clear that the 'eval_expr' function in 'sympy_parser.py' is central to the issue, as it directly evaluates the string representation of the 'other' object, which can be unsafe if derived from an unknown source.

This behavior is dangerous as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. The issue specifically points to the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, where the `eval` function is used with potentially unsafe input. The provided file_context includes the relevant sections of `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. The search_results provide additional context from `sympy/core/sympify.py` and `sympy/printing/repr.py`. While the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` does not directly use `eval`, it calls `parse_expr` which then uses `eval_expr`. The `ReprPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/repr.py` is not directly related to the issue, but understanding the representation of objects might indirectly help in fixing the problem. The key task is to fix or replace the use of `eval` in `eval_expr` to prevent unsafe code execution.",
