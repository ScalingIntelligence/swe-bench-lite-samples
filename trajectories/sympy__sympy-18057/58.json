The traceback indicates that the issue occurs in the `sympify` method of `sympy/core/sympify.py` when it calls `parse_expr` from `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. The main concern seems to be the `eval_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, which directly evaluates the string representation of objects. This behavior can lead to undesired execution of arbitrary code and should be avoided. The relevant code spans in the search results include the `sympify` method, the `parse_expr` function, and the `eval_expr` function. These functions are central to how Sympy converts objects to its own types and evaluates expressions, making them the focal points for addressing the issue. The goal should be to modify or replace the usage of eval to prevent security vulnerabilities while maintaining the functionality of the library.",
