            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it is clear that the problem lies in the `__eq__` method of the `Sympy` library, where it incorrectly attempts to use `eval` on the string representation of unknown objects. This is dangerous and triggers unexpected behavior when comparing symbolic expressions with custom objects whose `__repr__` method returns strings that cannot be evaluated as valid Sympy expressions.\n\nGiven the search results, several files and spans of code are related to the `__eq__` method in different classes within the Sympy library. The most relevant classes are `Expr`, `Symbol`, `Token`, `Lambda`, and `interval`, all of which have their own implementations of the `__eq__` method.\n\nAmong these, the `Expr` and `Symbol` classes are particularly relevant because they are central to the functionality of Sympy. The `Expr` class represents mathematical expressions, and the `Symbol` class represents mathematical variables. The issue reported suggests that the `__eq__` method in these classes (or their subclasses) is attempting to use `eval` on the string representation of objects, which leads to the problem.\n\nFrom the search results, the `__eq__` method in the `Expr` class tries to `sympify` the other object and then compare it, but it does not use `eval`. Similarly, the `__eq__` method in the `Symbol` class compares the name and assumptions of the symbol but does not use `eval`. Therefore, the initial hypothesis about the use of `eval` might not directly apply to these classes.\n\nHowever, the traceback provided in the reported issue points to the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which is used in the `__eq__` method of the `Expr` class. This suggests that the problem might lie deeper in the `sympify` function or in how it behaves with custom objects.\n\nGiven these observations, the focus should be on understanding how the `sympify` function treats custom objects and whether it attempts to use `eval` on their representations. The relevant code spans are those in the `Expr` and `Symbol` classes, especially their `__eq__` methods and the parts where they interact with the `sympify` function.",
