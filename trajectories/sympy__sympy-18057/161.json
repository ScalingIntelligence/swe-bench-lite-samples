The key line of code causing the issue is found in `eval_expr` of `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, where `eval` is directly used with the code provided by the `__repr__` method of an unknown object. This behavior is highly problematic and needs immediate attention.\n\nRelevant files for fixing this issue involve those which handle the equality check, especially `Expr.__eq__` in `sympy/core/expr.py` and `Basic.__eq__` in `sympy/core/basic.py`, as these methods are responsible for comparing expressions. From the search results, three significant spans in `sympy/core/expr.py` are relevant: `Expr.__eq__`, `Expr.is_polynomial`, and `Expr.is_rational_function`. These spans involve methods used to compare and validate expressions, indicating possible points of intervention to secure the equality check. Additionally, the methods `__eq__` in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/function.py` could also be relevant as they deal with numerical and functional comparisons, respectively. These regions represent potential entry points to patch the vulnerability by avoiding the use of `eval` with untrusted input.",

This line is crucial as it directly involves the unsafe 'eval' call.

The search results reveal the actual 'eval' usage in the 'eval_expr' function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py.
