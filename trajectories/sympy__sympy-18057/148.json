The `sympify` function ultimately calls `parse_expr` from `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, where the unsafe `eval_expr` function is used. This is corroborated by the traceback in the issue, which shows the sequence of function calls leading to the problematic `eval` call.\n\nThe identified code spans demonstrate the flow: the `__eq__` method attempts to convert the 'other' object into a SymPy object using `sympify`, which then goes through `parse_expr`, ending in potentially evaluating unsafe code. This is precisely where the issue of unintended code execution arises.\n\nGiven the severity and the direct relevance of the reported issue to the code spans provided, the current search results adequately address the problem.

This is directly related to the reported issue where passing strings produced by unknown objects into `eval` is dangerous. Additionally, the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` is central to the reported behavior because it triggers the `sympify` function which in turn invokes `parse_expr` and subsequently `eval_expr`. The file context provided clearly identifies the relevant parts of the code involved in this issue, particularly the `eval_expr` function and its usage within the `parse_expr` and `sympify` functions. Thus, the relevant code which needs to be addressed to fix the issue is presented in the file context, making it complete for addressing the reported issue.",
