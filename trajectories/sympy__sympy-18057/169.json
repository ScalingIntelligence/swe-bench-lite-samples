The issue can be reproduced with custom objects whose __repr__ method returns strings that are not safe to eval. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the eval_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py, specifically on the line where eval is called. This suggests that the method responsible for this behavior is the __eq__ method in the Expr class in sympy/core/expr.py. The goal is to identify and fix this behavior to prevent accidental execution of arbitrary code. The search results confirm the presence of the problematic eval_expr function and the __eq__ method in Expr, which further validates the need to address these specific areas in the code. Additionally, the parse_expr function in the same file also involves the eval_expr function, indicating that this issue might have broader implications beyond just the __eq__ method.",
