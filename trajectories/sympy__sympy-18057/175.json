The relevant code spans were identified by tracing the execution from the __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py, where the sympify function is called. This function is responsible for converting the input to a SymPy object, which eventually leads to the call of eval in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py. The specific line of concern is `expr = eval(code, global_dict, local_dict)`, which directly uses eval on the input. This indicates that the issue lies primarily in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py and potentially also in the handling of sympify in sympy/core/sympify.py. These files and particular code spans are relevant to addressing the issue as they directly involve the evaluation of potentially unsafe user input in a context where the user would least expect it, posing a risk of arbitrary code execution.",
