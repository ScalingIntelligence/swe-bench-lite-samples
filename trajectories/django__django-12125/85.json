  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
