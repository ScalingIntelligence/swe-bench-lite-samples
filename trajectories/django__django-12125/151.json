This occurs specifically when these inner classes are used as fields within Django models. To address this, I need to find the exact code in the Django migration framework responsible for generating the migration files. I will focus on the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes since they are directly involved in constructing migration files. Additionally, I should look at the `ModelFieldSerializer` class which serializes model fields into a form that can be written to migration files. The specific issue is about the path resolution for inner classes, so I will also search for the logic that handles this.",

Specifically, when a subclass of django.db.models.Field is defined as an inner class, the generated migration file incorrectly refers to this inner class as if it were a top-level class. This problem is evident in the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes within `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, where the serialization of operations and fields occurs. The `OperationWriter.serialize` method handles the serialization of operations, including the deconstruction and reconstruction of arguments, which might be where the incorrect path for inner classes originates. Additionally, the `ModelFieldSerializer` in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is responsible for serializing model fields, and it uses the `deconstruct` method to get the path and arguments of the field, which could also contribute to the incorrect path issue for inner classes. The task is to identify the specific parts of the code that handle the serialization and deconstruction of fields and operations to pinpoint where the path generation for inner classes might be going wrong.",

These parts of the code are directly involved in the process of generating migration files. The OperationWriter class is responsible for serializing individual operations into a format suitable for writing into migration files. The MigrationWriter class orchestrates the overall process, managing imports and ensuring the correct format for all parts of the migration file. The ModelFieldSerializer class specifically handles the serialization of model fields, which includes both top-level and nested class fields. Given these details, I suspect the issue with inner class path resolution lies within the logic of these classes, particularly in how they handle the paths during serialization. Since the core classes handling migrations are present, and considering the specificity of the issue to the field and inner class handling during serialization, I believe the relevant parts of the file context have been identified.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
