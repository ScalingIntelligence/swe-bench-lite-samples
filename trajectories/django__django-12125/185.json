            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns how Django's migration system handles inner classes in models, specifically when generating migration files. The problem is that Django incorrectly references inner classes as if they were top-level classes in the module. This has been exemplified with both a custom field and an EnumField from django-enumfields, where the generated migrations incorrectly reference the inner classes.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, particularly within the `MigrationWriter` class. This class is responsible for writing migration files, and the issue likely involves how it serializes model fields and references to other classes. Specifically, the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class is of interest since it handles the serialization of operations, including field definitions. Also, the `serialize` method in the same class can be relevant as it manages the serialization of various objects used in the migration process.\n\nAdditionally, the `django/db/migrations/state.py` file contains the `ModelState` class, which is used to capture the state of a model at the time of migration. The `from_model` method in this class is responsible for creating a `ModelState` instance from an existing model, potentially where the incorrect referencing of inner classes could occur. Examining how this method handles field serialization and base class references could be crucial.\n\nFinally, understanding how fields are deconstructed and referenced in the `django/db/migrations/operations/base.py` file, specifically in the `Operation` class, might provide more insight into how inner classes are handled during the migration process.",

The search results contain several key files and spans that may be relevant to this issue.\n\nFirstly, the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file contains serializers for various types, including `ModelFieldSerializer` and `OperationSerializer`. These serializers are responsible for converting Python objects into a format that can be written to migration files. Incorrect serialization could lead to the issues described with inner classes.\n\nSecondly, the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file includes the `MigrationWriter` class, which is responsible for writing migration files to disk. The `OperationWriter` class within this file is also relevant as it serializes individual operations within a migration. Incorrect handling of inner classes during this serialization process could be a culprit.\n\nLastly, the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file contains the `MigrationAutodetector` class, which detects changes in models and generates new migrations. The `_resolve_dependency` method in this class is of particular interest as it deals with resolving dependencies, which could include inner classes. Incorrect resolution here could lead to the wrong paths being written to migration files.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these files and their respective methods are prime candidates for further investigation to diagnose and resolve the problem with inner class paths in Django migrations.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
