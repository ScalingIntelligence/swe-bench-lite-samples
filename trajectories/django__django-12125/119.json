This affects how the inner classes are referenced within the migrations file. It seems that the problem lies in how the models and fields are serialized or referenced during the migration generation process. Specifically, the `ModelFieldSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` might be a key part of the issue, as it deals with serializing model fields. Additionally, the `MigrationWriter` in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` could be involved in writing the incorrect paths to the migrations file. Furthermore, the `ModelOperation` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and the `FieldOperation` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` might handle the operations that lead to incorrect paths. It's also worth checking the `_get_app_label_and_model_name` function in `django/db/migrations/state.py`, as it might return incorrect names for inner classes.",

This issue is critical for accurately representing the hierarchy in generated migration files. The key files and code spans that are relevant to this issue are those that handle the serialization and creation of migration operations, particularly where models and their fields are being processed and recorded in the migrations. The `serializer.py` file contains classes like `DeconstructableSerializer` and `ModelFieldSerializer` that are responsible for serializing model fields during the migration process. The `models.py` file within the `operations` directory contains the `CreateModel` class, which is central to the creation of new models in migrations. This class specifically needs to correctly reference inner classes when generating the migration. Additionally, the `writer.py` file is relevant for understanding how the `MigrationWriter` class handles the writing of migrations to files, ensuring that the paths are correctly represented. The analysis of these code spans reveals that there is a critical gap in handling the serialization and reference of inner classes within models. This gap is likely the root cause of the incorrect path generation observed in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
