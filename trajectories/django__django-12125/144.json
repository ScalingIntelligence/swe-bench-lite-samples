This involves understanding how Django handles model definitions, especially when inner classes are used for fields, and how these are referenced in the generated migration files. The search results provided contain relevant code from Django's migration operations and model base classes. Specifically, the `CreateModel` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is crucial as it defines how a new model is created during a migration. This class includes methods for referencing models and fields, which is central to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is significant as it defines the base model behavior in Django, including how fields are initialized and managed. The `serializer_factory` function in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is also relevant as it deals with serializing various Django objects, including model fields, which is essential for correctly representing the inner class fields in the migration files. These sections of code are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the issue of incorrect path handling for inner classes in migrations.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
