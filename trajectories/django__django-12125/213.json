The inner classes, such as a nested EnumField from django-enumfields, are being referenced incorrectly in the migrations files. This might involve the serialization and reference logic in the Django's migration operations and state management modules. Specifically, the code might need adjustment in handling nested class references within model definitions. Given the context, it's crucial to inspect and potentially modify the serialization and reference resolution logic within the migration-related files.",

The generated migrations incorrectly refer to these inner classes as top-level classes. This problem is evident in the generated migrations files where inner classes are referenced without their outer class context. The search results include several files related to Django's migration system, especially `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, `django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py`, `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. These files contain classes and methods critical for creating and serializing migrations. Specifically, `CreateModel` in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is central to this issue as it defines how model creation is serialized into migrations. This class and its methods should be reviewed for how they handle the serialization of inner classes to identify potential fixes or patches.",
