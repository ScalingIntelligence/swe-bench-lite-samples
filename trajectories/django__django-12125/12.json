Specifically, when a subclass of `django.db.models.Field` is defined as an inner class of another class and used within a `django.db.models.Model` class, the generated migrations file incorrectly refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class. The issue can be observed with both custom fields and fields from third-party libraries like `django-enumfields`. The provided search results include code spans that deal with the creation and alteration of models in migrations, such as the `CreateModel`, `DeleteModel`, `RenameModel`, and `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operations. These operations involve handling fields and base classes, which is directly related to the issue described. Additionally, the `MigrationWriter` and `OperationSerializer` classes handle the serialization of migrations and operations, which could be where the incorrect paths are being generated or represented in the migration files. These classes and methods are relevant because they are responsible for translating the models and fields into the operations that `makemigrations` outputs. Based on this analysis, the most relevant code spans are those that involve the creation of models, especially `CreateModel`, and the serialization of these models into migrations files, especially `MigrationWriter`.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
