The problem is that the migrations file incorrectly refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class. To address this, we need to focus on the code responsible for generating migration paths and serialization of model fields. The relevant files appear to be those in the 'django/db/migrations' directory, particularly 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', where the serialization of model fields and the writing of migration files occur. We should also look at 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' to understand how model operations are handled.",

The search results provide several key files and spans that are relevant to this issue. The 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file contains the 'MigrationWriter' class which is responsible for writing migration files. The 'serialize' method in this class is crucial as it determines how different parts of a model are serialized into the migration file. The 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' file contains serializers for different types of fields, including 'ModelFieldSerializer', which is relevant for ensuring that fields are serialized correctly. The 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file contains the 'CreateModel' class, which defines operations for creating models in migrations, including the handling of fields and bases. Key spans of interest include 'ModelFieldSerializer.serialize', 'CreateModel.references_model', and 'MigrationWriter.serialize' as they deal directly with the serialization and handling of model fields and their paths.
