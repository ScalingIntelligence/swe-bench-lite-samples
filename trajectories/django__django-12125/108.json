This discrepancy needs to be corrected to accurately reflect the class's location within the module.\n\nThe search results provided include several key files and sections of code that are relevant to this issue. The `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file contains the `ModelFieldSerializer` class and its `serialize` method, which is responsible for deconstructing and serializing model fields. This is directly related to how fields are processed and represented in migration files.\n\nThe `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file includes the `MigrationWriter` class, which is responsible for writing migration files. It is crucial for understanding how migration files are constructed, including the paths and references used within them.\n\nThe `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file includes operations related to model changes in migrations, such as `CreateModel`, `DeleteModel`, and `RenameModel`. These operations handle various aspects of model representation in migrations and could affect how inner classes are referenced.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the problem where inner classes are incorrectly referenced in migration files.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
