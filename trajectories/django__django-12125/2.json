The problem specifically occurs when an inner class is defined as a subclass of django.db.models.Field within another class and then used in a django.db.models.Model class. The generated migrations file incorrectly references the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module. To address this, it's necessary to investigate the code responsible for generating the migrations file, particularly focusing on the serialization and writing processes. The relevant files and classes identified from the context include those related to migration state, serializer, recorder, writer, and operations. Specifically, the ModelFieldSerializer and MigrationWriter classes and their methods are likely candidates for this issue.",
