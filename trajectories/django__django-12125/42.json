The main problem is that the generated migration files incorrectly reference these inner classes as top-level classes, leading to incorrect paths. To address this, it's necessary to look at how Django serializes and handles model fields during the migration process. From the search results, the `ModelFieldSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is especially relevant. This class is responsible for serializing model fields, which includes the process of determining the path to the field class. The `ModelFieldSerializer.serialize` method specifically handles the deconstruction of fields into their path, args, and kwargs, which are then used to generate the migration code. This method is a key piece in understanding how Django constructs the reference to field classes in migrations. Additionally, examining how the `CreateModel` operation in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` constructs the model and fields during migration can provide more context on the issue. This operation is responsible for creating new models in the database and involves directly referencing and handling fields. By analyzing these spans of code, we can begin to understand how and where the incorrect path generation occurs and potentially identify a fix or improvement to handle inner classes appropriately.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
