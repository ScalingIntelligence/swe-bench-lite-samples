The issue specifically notes that when defining a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class within another class and using this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, the generated migrations file incorrectly refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class, leading to a path error. Given the nature of the problem, the analysis should focus on the parts of the code responsible for generating migrations and handling class references. The provided search results include two key files: 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py'. Both files contain code related to the migration process and are thus relevant for this issue. I have identified the code spans within these files that handle the creation and execution of migrations, particularly those related to project state, app configurations, and migration operations. These parts are crucial as they directly affect how class references are processed and stored in the generated migration files. By analyzing these sections, we can understand how the path for inner classes is determined and potentially identify the source of the incorrect path issue.",

Since the exact location of the path construction logic is not clear from the snippet, we can assume it to be within the block where migrations are written.",

  "initial_message": "makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes\nDescription\n\t\nWhen you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.\nTo reproduce, create the following as your model:\nclass Outer(object):\n\tclass Inner(models.CharField):\n\t\tpass\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tfield = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)\nAfter running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='A',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('field', test1.models.Inner(max_length=20)),\n\t],\n),\nNote the test1.models.Inner, which should have been test1.models.Outer.Inner.\nThe real life case involved an EnumField from django-enumfields, defined as an inner class of a Django Model class, similar to this:\nimport enum\nfrom enumfields import Enum, EnumField\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\t@enum.unique\n\tclass State(Enum):\n\t\ton = 'on'\n\t\toff = 'off'\n\tstate = EnumField(enum=State)\nThis results in the following migrations code:\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\tname='Thing',\n\tfields=[\n\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t('state', enumfields.fields.EnumField(enum=test1.models.State, max_length=10)),\n\t],\n),\nThis refers to test1.models.State, instead of to test1.models.Thing.State.\n"
