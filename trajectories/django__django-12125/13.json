The main focus is on how Django's migration tool incorrectly interprets the path of inner classes when generating migration files. This issue can be particularly seen when inner classes are used for custom fields within models.\n\nIn the provided search results, we have a relevant file `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, which contains key parts of the migration serialization process. Specifically, the `ModelFieldSerializer` class and its `serialize` method are critical as they handle the serialization of model fields. This class uses the `deconstruct` method from the field object to get the path and other attributes, which are then serialized into the migration file.\n\nGiven the issue description, it appears that the problem could stem from how the `serialize` method processes the path obtained from the `deconstruct` method. If this path does not correctly reflect the hierarchical structure of nested classes (e.g., it does not include 'Outer.Inner' but only 'Inner'), it could lead to the observed incorrect path in the migration files. Thus, focusing on the `ModelFieldSerializer.serialize` method and understanding how it handles and constructs the path is crucial for addressing this issue.",
