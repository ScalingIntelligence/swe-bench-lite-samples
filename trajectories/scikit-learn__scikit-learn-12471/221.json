The _legacy_transform method particularly addresses the legacy mode handling and might be where modifications could be necessary to prevent the ValueError. Additionally, the _transform_new method is also relevant as it handles the new mode, which could be a target for adding checks or modifications to handle string lengths appropriately. The transform method, which selects the appropriate transformation mode based on the encoder's configuration, is another crucial part to consider.

The _transform_new method is also highlighted as a critical part of the transformation process, particularly for newer handling of data considering categories and unknown values. Given the issue described, focusing on these methods, particularly where they handle unknown categories and transform string data, is essential for identifying the root cause and potential fixes related to the memory handling of strings and the treatment of unknown categories.",
