This issue suggests a potential flaw in how the encoder processes these unknown categories, especially when they have to be set to the first category alphabetically. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that address aspects of this problem. Specifically, the `_BaseEncoder._fit` and `_BaseEncoder._transform` methods are critical as they deal with fitting the encoder to data and transforming input data respectively. These methods implement checks for unknown categories and handle exceptions when unknown categories are encountered, aligning with the report's focus on error handling during transformation. The `OneHotEncoder.__init__`, `OneHotEncoder.fit`, and `OneHotEncoder.transform` methods also provide the initialization settings and the actual methods used to fit and transform the data, contextualizing how the OneHotEncoder class is set up and used. These code spans are crucial for understanding and modifying the behavior of the OneHotEncoder in response to the reported issue.

It involves type checking if the dtype of X_temp isinstance of str and changes the dtype back to np.object if necessary. It also deals with the deprecation of object type dtype checking within the class through X_object check and other associated methods. The method then processes the transformation by calling _transform and shapes the output data. Additionally, there is a transformation mask while handling the data during transformation. Therefore, it ensures type checking and casting operations as required.

The memory of the arrays is not handled safely and it can lead to a ValueError\r\n\r\nBasically, when you call the transform method it will sets all the unknown strings on your array to OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] which is the first category alphabetically sorted given for fit\r\nIf this OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] is a long string, and the array that you want to transform has small strings, then it is impossible to fit the whole  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] into the entries of the array we want to transform. So  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]  is truncated and this raise the ValueError.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\r\n\r\n\r\n# It needs to be numpy arrays, the error does not appear \r\n# is you have lists of lists because it gets treated like an array of objects.\r\ntrain  = np.array([ '22','333','4444','11111111' ]).reshape((-1,1))\r\ntest   = np.array([ '55555',  '22' ]).reshape((-1,1))\r\n\r\nohe = OneHotEncoder(dtype=bool,handle_unknown='ignore')\r\n\r\nohe.fit( train )\r\nenc_test = ohe.transform( test )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nHere we should get an sparse matrix 2x4 false everywhere except at (1,1) the '22' that is known\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\n\r\n> ValueError: y contains previously unseen labels: ['111111']\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18)  [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\r\n   machine: Linux-4.4.0-138-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python\r\n\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\ncblas_libs: openblas, openblas\r\n  lib_dirs: /usr/lib\r\n\r\nPython deps:\r\n    Cython: 0.25.2\r\n     scipy: 0.18.1\r\nsetuptools: 36.7.0\r\n       pip: 9.0.1\r\n     numpy: 1.15.2\r\n    pandas: 0.19.1\r\n   sklearn: 0.21.dev0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Comments\r\n\r\nI already implemented a fix for this issue, where I check the size of the elements in the array before, and I cast them into objects if necessary.\n"
