The memory of the arrays is not handled safely and it can lead to a ValueError\r\n\r\nBasically, when you call the transform method it will sets all the unknown strings on your array to OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] which is the first category alphabetically sorted given for fit\r\nIf this OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] is a long string, and the array that you want to transform has small strings, then it is impossible to fit the whole  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] into the entries of the array we want to transform. So  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]  is truncated and this raise the ValueError.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\r\n\r\n\r\n# It needs to be numpy arrays, the error does not appear \r\n# is you have lists of lists because it gets treated like an array of objects.\r\ntrain  = np.array([ '22','333','4444','11111111' ]).reshape((-1,1))\r\ntest   = np.array([ '55555',  '22' ]).reshape((-1,1))\r\n\r\nohe = OneHotEncoder(dtype=bool,handle_unknown='ignore')\r\n\r\nohe.fit( train )\r\nenc_test = ohe.transform( test )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nHere we should get an sparse matrix 2x4 false everywhere except at (1,1) the '22' that is known\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\n\r\n> ValueError: y contains previously unseen labels: ['111111']\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18)  [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\r\n   machine: Linux-4.4.0-138-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python\r\n\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\ncblas_libs: openblas, openblas\r\n  lib_dirs: /usr/lib\r\n\r\nPython deps:\r\n    Cython: 0.25.2\r\n     scipy: 0.18.1\r\nsetuptools: 36.7.0\r\n       pip: 9.0.1\r\n     numpy: 1.15.2\r\n    pandas: 0.19.1\r\n   sklearn: 0.21.dev0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Comments\r\n\r\nI already implemented a fix for this issue, where I check the size of the elements in the array before, and I cast them into objects if necessary.\n"
