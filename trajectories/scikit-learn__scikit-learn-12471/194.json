Key points mentioned are the use of the 'handle_unknown' parameter set to 'ignore', the transformation method, and the handling of array memory when strings of varying lengths are involved.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, we can identify that the relevant parts of the code surround the `_transform` method within the `_BaseEncoder` class and the `transform` method within the `OneHotEncoder` class. These methods deal directly with the transformation of data and the handling of unknown categories, which aligns with the reported issue.\n\nSpecifically, the `_transform` method includes logic to check for unknown categories and handle them according to the 'handle_unknown' parameter. This is crucial for understanding how the encoder handles unknown strings and determines if the handling might lead to MemoryError. The `transform` method in `OneHotEncoder` also plays a role as it triggers the transformation process. Thus, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
