The current file context and search results focused deeply on the OneHotEncoder class and its methods, particularly the transform and _transform_new methods. The transform method is essential as it is where the actual transformation takes place, and _transform_new handles unknown categories in a non-legacy mode. The provided search results include code spans that reveal how the encoder processes input data, checks for unknown categories, and constructs the output sparse matrix. These spans align closely with the reported issue's focus on the transform method's behavior when handling unknown categories and fitting data into pre-defined arrays. They offer insights into the error scenario described, where long strings can cause the arrays to truncate if they are not appropriately handled. Based on these observations, I conclude that these code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

The error occurs due to memory handling issues when the first category (alphabetically sorted) is a long string and the array to be transformed contains smaller strings. This leads to truncation and a ValueError. Understanding the problem, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the transformation process, specifically focusing on how unknown categories are handled and how data encoding occurs. The provided file context already includes several key methods from the OneHotEncoder class, such as `_BaseEncoder._check_X`, `OneHotEncoder.__init__`, and `OneHotEncoder.transform`. The search results reveal the `_BaseEncoder._transform` method, which is crucial as it encodes the data and checks for unknown categories. This method is where the actual transformation logic resides and where the handling of unknown categories is defined. Given the description of the issue, the identified code spans are relevant as they pertain to the exact logic that needs to be examined and potentially corrected to handle the described error. Therefore, the search results are complete in terms of identifying the relevant code spans that will aid in resolving the issue.",
