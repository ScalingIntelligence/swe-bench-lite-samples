The 'Response' class is identified as relevant due to its methods 'iter_content' and 'text' which are directly related to the issue. No previous context is provided, indicating that this is the first analysis of relevant files and spans. After analyzing the provided 'requests/models.py' file and the spans within, it's clear that the 'Response' class contains both 'iter_content' and 'text' methods. Specifically, 'iter_content' uses a generator to yield chunks of data, which are decoded if 'decode_unicode' is True. However, the decoding process is handled by 'stream_decode_response_unicode' which fits the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, 'text' property directly converts bytes to a unicode string using the specified or apparent encoding. The analysis confirms that the discrepancy in behavior (bytes from 'iter_content' vs unicode from 'text') lies in how the bytes are handled and decoded.

The provided code reveals that `iter_content` returns chunks (which are processed through `stream_decode_response_unicode` if `decode_unicode=True`) and then yields them. However, `text` directly returns a string using the specified or apparent encoding. This explains why `iter_content` still returns bytes even when `decode_unicode=True` - it only applies decoding while yielding chunks, unlike `text` which decodes and combines chunks into a string.

The search results provide a detailed code analysis of the methods in question from the requests library.\n\nIn the provided file context, the 'Response' class includes both the 'iter_content' and 'text' methods. The 'iter_content' method processes the content in chunks, optionally decoding it to unicode based on the 'decode_unicode' parameter. The 'text' property, on the other hand, returns the entire content as a unicode string, using the response's encoding.\n\nThe new search result introduces 'stream_decode_response_unicode', a utility function that decodes an iterator of content chunks into unicode, which is used within the 'iter_content' method when 'decode_unicode' is set to True. This function ensures that if the response encoding is not None, each chunk is decoded using the appropriate incremental decoder.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans that directly address the reported issue are those within the 'Response' class for 'iter_content' and 'text', as well as the 'stream_decode_response_unicode' function in utils.py, as they collectively demonstrate how content is processed and decoded in the requests library, specifically concerning the differences between iterating over content and directly accessing it as text.",

My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
