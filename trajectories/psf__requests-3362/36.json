The user expects both to return unicode objects, but `iter_content` returns bytes when `decode_unicode=True`. This discrepancy indicates a need to delve into the source code of the `requests` library, specifically focusing on the `Response` class methods `iter_content` and `text`, and potentially related utility functions that handle encoding and decoding. Additionally, understanding how the underlying `urllib3` library interacts with these methods might offer further insight. No specific patterns or code snippets have been provided by the user in the issue itself, so initial searches should be broad to catch relevant implementations. The focus should be on the `Response` class, the `iter_content` method, and any utility functions involved in decoding HTTP responses.",

The key points of interest are the implementations of both `iter_content` and `text` methods in the `Response` class of the `requests` module. In `iter_content`, the method processes data in chunks and applies `decode_unicode` if specified, but it returns bytes unless explicitly decoded. In contrast, `text` property directly returns a unicode object, str, using the specified or inferred encoding. This explains why `iter_content` might return bytes even when `decode_unicode` is `True`, unlike the `text` property, which consistently returns a unicode string. For a better understanding, I also reviewed instances where `iter_content` gathers chunks and applies decoding based on the `decode_unicode` parameter, emphasizing the immediate output type difference between these methods. The analysis also involved checking for alternative approaches or settings that might align `iter_content`'s output more closely with `text`'s behavior in terms of immediate output type. Given this understanding, the identified spans provide a clear explanation of why `iter_content` might behave differently from `text` with respect to output data type even when `decode_unicode` is `True`.",
