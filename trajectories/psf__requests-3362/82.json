Specifically, when `decode_unicode` is set to `True`, it is expected that `iter_content` would return a unicode object, similar to `text`. However, the user observes `iter_content` returning bytes instead. The search should focus on the `Response` class methods and their interaction with encoding and decoding, potentially including the underlying `urllib3` library that might handle these operations.",

The user expects both to return a unicode object, but iter_content returns bytes when decode_unicode is True. To resolve this, understanding the implementation of iter_content and text in the Response class is crucial. The search results include a detailed look into the Response class in the requests/models.py file. Here, we can see the implementation of both iter_content and text methods. The iter_content method uses a generator function to yield chunks of content, optionally decoding them to unicode based on the decode_unicode parameter. The text method, on the other hand, always returns a unicode string by decoding the content using the determined encoding. Reviewing these methods, especially considering how iter_content handles decoding when decode_unicode is True, provides a clear context for the reported issue. The identified code spans cover the necessary parts of the Response class for analyzing the issue's root cause.",

This context is sufficient to assess the difference in behavior between these two methods regarding content decoding. The `iter_content` method indeed checks if `decode_unicode` is True and applies decoding accordingly. However, it appears that due to the nature of the chunk streaming and potentially how the underlying `raw.stream` or `raw.read` methods handle content decoding in conjunction with the `stream_decode_response_unicode` function, there might be a discrepancy between what `iter_content` with decode_unicode=True returns versus the `text` property's immediate decoding. This detailed inclusion of code snippets enables a deep understanding of why these methods might differ and why the observed behavior occurs. Therefore, the analysis based on this context is complete and addresses the reported issue effectively without needing to refer to external parts of the codebase.",

The instructions focus on fixing attribute access errors and method references within the class. Here is a breakdown of the specific changes:\n\n1. **Reference `self._content` correctly**: Ensure there are no linting errors related to 'content' member in the way `self._content` is accessed.\n   \n2. **Correct method references**: Specifically, ensure that calls to `iter_content` and `raise_for_status` are correctly referenced within the class context.\n\n### Analysis\nGiven the instructions, it's apparent that the changes are intended to be minimal and specifically targeted at resolving lint errors and ensuring correct method access within the class. Since the original code snippet does not display the exact lines where these issues occur, it's assumed that the changes would be implemented directly within the methods and properties that interact with `self._content` and the methods `iter_content` and `raise_for_status`.\n\n### Implementation\nThe instructions suggest that typical issues could arise from improper references to class attributes or methods within the class's scope. Here\u2019s how these changes can be applied assuming typical problematic patterns (like attempted access to `self.content` directly instead of `self._content`, or non-existent method calls):\n\n```python\n<replace>\n    def __iter__(self):\n        \"\"\"Allows you to use a response as an iterator.\"\"\"\n        return self.iter_content(128)\n\n    @property\n    def ok(self):\n        try:\n            self.raise_for_status()\n        except HTTPError:\n            return False\n        return True\n\n    @property\n    def is_redirect(self):\n        \"\"\"True if this Response is a well-formed HTTP redirect that could have\n        been processed automatically (by :meth:`Session.resolve_redirects`).\n        \"\"\"\n        return ('location' in self.headers and self.status_code in REDIRECT_STATI)\n\n    @property\n    def is_permanent_redirect(self):\n        \"\"\"True if this Response one of the permanent versions of redirect\"\"\"\n        return ('location' in self.headers and self.status_code in (codes.moved_permanently, codes.permanent_redirect))\n\n    @property\n    def apparent_encoding(self):\n        \"\"\"The apparent encoding, provided by the chardet library\"\"\"\n        return chardet.detect(self.content)['encoding']\n</replace>"
