The user expects both to return a unicode object but finds that iter_content returns bytes when decode_unicode is True. This indicates a need to delve deeper into the implementation of these methods in the requests library, particularly in models.py and utils.py. Additionally, the urllib3 response handling might also be relevant since it is used internally by the requests library.",

Specifically, they are expecting `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` to return unicode while it returns bytes. It seems they misunderstand that `iter_content` does not directly convert bytes to unicode, although when `decode_unicode` is set to True, it does in fact attempt to decode the streamed content into unicode, possibly through a different logic to how the `self.text` approach decodes things.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevance is determined mainly through the `iter_content` and `text` identified spans and how `iter_content` implements the decoding with `decode_unicode` parameter.\n\nThe identified spans in `requests/models.py` are critical as they show how both `iter_content` and `text` is implemented and the differences between the two which could lead to a mismatch of expected behaviors as shown by the user's issue.",

The text property directly converts the content to a unicode string using the specified or apparent encoding.

The decoding process, controlled by the decode_unicode parameter, is handled in part by the generate function within iter_content and by stream_decode_response_unicode in utils.py. Given the context, a closer look at how urllib3's HTTPResponse handles content decoding and streaming, specifically within its stream method, could shed light on why iter_content returns bytes when decode_unicode is True.
