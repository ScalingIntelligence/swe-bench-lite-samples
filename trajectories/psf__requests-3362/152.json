The user expects both methods to return Unicode objects but finds `iter_content` returning bytes while `text` returns Unicode. This discrepancy needs to be explained. The relevant part of the context is in the `Response` class with `iter_content` method. The key to understanding this is the `iter_content` method where the `decode_unicode` parameter determines whether to decode the chunks as Unicode or return them as bytes. The `stream_decode_response_unicode` function in `utils.py` is responsible for decoding the chunks if `decode_unicode` is set to `True`. This function uses the encoding from the response to decode each chunk, which explains why it might still return bytes if the encoding is not correctly identified or set. The `get_encoding_from_headers` function is also crucial as it identifies the encoding from the headers, which is used in the decoding process. The provided search results include other utility functions that might be indirectly relevant, such as `iter_slices` and `get_unicode_from_response`, though these are less directly related to the issue at hand. Specifically, examining the `iter_content` and `stream_decode_response_unicode` methods will provide a clear understanding of why `iter_content` might return bytes instead of Unicode even when `decode_unicode` is True.",

This confirms how content decoding works. The user's assumption about the equivalence wasn't completely accurate. In essence, `iter_content` doesn't operate like `r.text` because `iter_content` can yield quite differently depending on how much data it gets each time. By setting `decode_unicode=True` yields in unicode but does not change the working pattern of yielding as chunks.

My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
