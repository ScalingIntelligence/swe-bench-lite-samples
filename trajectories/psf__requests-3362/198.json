The user expected `iter_content` to return a unicode object like `r.text` does, but it returned bytes instead. This suggests a need to delve deeper into how the `iter_content` method is implemented in the context of decoding. Currently, the provided context includes several relevant files, such as `requests/models.py` and `requests/utils.py`, which contain class `Response` and related utility functions. However, there is no direct reference to an 'iter_text' method, indicating that the user's assumption might be based on an expectation rather than an existing method or function. To address this, we should focus our search on the `iter_content` method within the `Response` class and any supporting utility functions that might help clarify the handling of content during iteration.",
