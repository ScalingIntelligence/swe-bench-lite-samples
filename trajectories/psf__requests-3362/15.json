The search results provided contain the relevant methods from the `Response` class in the `requests` library, specifically `iter_content` and `text`. The `iter_content` method includes a parameter `decode_unicode`, which, when set to `True`, suggests decoding the content into unicode. However, the method appears to yield chunks of bytes when called with `decode_unicode=True`. On the other hand, the `text` property explicitly converts the content into a string (unicode) using the specified or apparent encoding. This discrepancy seems to be the root of the user's confusion. Additionally, it's worth noting that the `iter_content` method uses a generator function to yield chunks of data, which might explain why bytes are still returned even when `decode_unicode=True`. This behavior aligns with the reported issue, making these code spans relevant to understanding and addressing the issue.",
