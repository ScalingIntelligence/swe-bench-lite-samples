From the search results, we can identify relevant code spans that address the difference in behavior and the mechanisms behind content decoding in the `requests` library.\n\n- The `Response.iter_content` method is key as it outlines the logic for chunked content retrieval and decoding based on the `decode_unicode` parameter. This method directly addresses the user's confusion by detailing how decoding is handled when the parameter is set to `True`.\n\n- The `stream_decode_response_unicode` function in `requests/utils.py` is also relevant.

This function attempts to decode each chunk using the specified encoding of the response. However, it seems that the implementation assumes that the chunks it receives are already in bytes format, as it directly passes these chunks to the decoder. This could explain why `next(r.iter_content(16*1024, decode_unicode=True))` still returns bytes, as it may not be converting the chunks into strings before decoding. In contrast, `r.text` directly accesses the content after it has been fully decoded into a unicode string. Given this analysis, the relevant code sections responsible for these behaviors have been identified. However, to fully understand the discrepancy, additional investigation into how the data chunks are processed in `stream_decode_response_unicode` and at what point they are expected to be converted into strings before decoding would be beneficial.",

To better understand this, we need to delve deeper into how the encoding is determined and set in the `Response` object, as well as how the `text` property processes the content to return a unicode string. It's worth checking if the `encoding` attribute is correctly set and used in both `iter_content` and `text` methods.

The `iter_content` method includes logic to yield chunks of content, which can be decoded to unicode if `decode_unicode=True`. However, it delegates this decoding process to the `stream_decode_response_unicode` function. The `text` property directly handles the conversion of the content to a unicode string, using the determined encoding. The discrepancy noted in the issue might arise from differences in how encoding is determined and applied in these two methods. For instance, the `text` property uses `self.apparent_encoding` if `self.encoding` is `None`, whereas `iter_content` likely uses the encoding set in the `Response` object directly. This suggests that investigating the encoding determination step and how it differs between these methods could provide more insights. The file context provided is comprehensive enough to indicate where these differences might lie.",

An important observation is that if `self.encoding` is `None` in `iter_content`, the content is returned without decoding. In contrast, `text` will attempt to use `self.apparent_encoding` if `self.encoding` is `None`. This suggests that checking the logic that determines and sets `self.encoding` and `self.apparent_encoding` could offer the key to understanding the discrepancy.

My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
