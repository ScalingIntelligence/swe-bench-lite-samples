It seems that when refit=False, the code attempts to take the mean of coefficients across folds without reshaping them properly, leading to an IndexError due to incorrect multi-dimensional array indexing.\n\nThe current file context already includes the relevant 'fit' method from 'LogisticRegressionCV' class, and the search results contain additional sections of the same file that include the '_logistic_regression_path' function, which is likely to be relevant for understanding the error in the refit=False case. Additionally, the '_logistic_regression_path' function is responsible for the actual path of computation in logistic regression, so understanding its dynamics could be instrumental in fixing the reported issue. The contextual file content also includes the '__init__' method of 'LogisticRegressionCV', providing insight into the parameters and their default behaviors.\n\nAnother file provided in the search results, 'sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py', contains the 'cross_validate' function, which is unrelated to the reported issue directly as it pertains to cross-validation setup rather than the specific LogisticRegression computation error.
