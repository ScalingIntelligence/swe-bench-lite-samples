Specifically, the error stack trace points to the line where, in the absence of refitting, coefficients are being averaged across folds using `np.mean([coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :] for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)`. The specific issue likely stems from how `best_indices` is defined or how `coefs_paths` is structured, potentially leading to an array being indexed with more dimensions than it possesses. Focusing on these lines in the `LogisticRegressionCV` class definition within `logistic.py` should help pinpoint the exact cause of the error.",
