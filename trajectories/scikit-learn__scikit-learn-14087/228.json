To address this issue, we need to examine the LogisticRegressionCV class and its fit method, particularly the section where the mean of coefficients paths is calculated. Comparing the reported error stack trace with the provided code, the error occurs at the line where np.mean is used to calculate the mean of coefficients paths across folds. This suggests that the error is likely due to an incorrect handling of the array dimensions when refit=False.
