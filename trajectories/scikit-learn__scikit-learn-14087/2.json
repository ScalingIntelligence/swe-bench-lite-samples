Specifically, the lines of code related to the 'else' block handling `refit=False` are relevant, as they deal with the calculation of coefficients without refitting. I identified these spans because they directly pertain to the conditions and operations that could lead to the IndexError mentioned in the issue, particularly the section where the mean of the coefficients is calculated across folds without refitting.
