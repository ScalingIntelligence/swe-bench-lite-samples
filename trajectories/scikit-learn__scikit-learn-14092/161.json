            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights the need for more robust parameter checking in the NCA (Neighborhood Components Analysis) and across other estimators in the codebase. The specific problem is that parameter checks in NCA are too strict, leading to failures in GridSearch when parameters like `tol` and `n_components` are not of the expected type (e.g., 1 is not a float, and np.int64 is not int). This issue is exemplified with the NCA parameters in a GridSearchCV setup. Moreover, the issue suggests enhancing parameter checking to handle different types and constraints more flexibly, proposing a new tool for parameter validation. Upon analyzing the search results, the most relevant code is found in `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py`, where the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` class and its `__init__` and `_validate_params` methods are located. These methods define and validate the parameters `n_components`, `max_iter`, `tol`, etc., and demonstrate the strict type checking that causes the issue. Additionally, `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py` contains the `GridSearchCV` and `ParameterGrid` classes, which are integral to the GridSearch functionality described in the issue. These classes manage parameter grids and the search process, highlighting the interaction between GridSearch and the NCA parameters. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans include the parameter initialization and validation in the NCA class and the GridSearchCV structure, as they directly relate to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "NCA fails in GridSearch due to too strict parameter checks\nNCA checks its parameters to have a specific type, which can easily fail in a GridSearch due to how param grid is made.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\r\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis\r\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\r\n\r\nX = np.random.random_sample((100, 10))\r\ny = np.random.randint(2, size=100)\r\n\r\nnca = NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis()\r\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\r\n\r\npipe = Pipeline([('nca', nca),\r\n                 ('knn', knn)])\r\n                \r\nparams = {'nca__tol': [0.1, 0.5, 1],\r\n          'nca__n_components': np.arange(1, 10)}\r\n          \r\ngs = GridSearchCV(estimator=pipe, param_grid=params, error_score='raise')\r\ngs.fit(X,y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that for `tol`: 1 is not a float, and for  `n_components`: np.int64 is not int\r\n\r\nBefore proposing a fix for this specific situation, I'd like to have your general opinion about parameter checking.  \r\nI like this idea of common parameter checking tool introduced with the NCA PR. What do you think about extending it across the code-base (or at least for new or recent estimators) ?\r\n\r\nCurrently parameter checking is not always done or often partially done, and is quite redundant. For instance, here is the input validation of lda:\r\n```python\r\ndef _check_params(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Check model parameters.\"\"\"\r\n        if self.n_components <= 0:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'n_components' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.n_components)\r\n\r\n        if self.total_samples <= 0:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'total_samples' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.total_samples)\r\n\r\n        if self.learning_offset < 0:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'learning_offset' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.learning_offset)\r\n\r\n        if self.learning_method not in (\"batch\", \"online\"):\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'learning_method' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.learning_method)\r\n```\r\nmost params aren't checked and for those who are there's a lot of duplicated code.\r\n\r\nA propose to be upgrade the new tool to be able to check open/closed intervals (currently only closed) and list membership.\r\n\r\nThe api would be something like that:\r\n```\r\ncheck_param(param, name, valid_options)\r\n```\r\nwhere valid_options would be a dict of `type: constraint`. e.g for the `beta_loss` param of `NMF`, it can be either a float or a string in a list, which would give\r\n```\r\nvalid_options = {numbers.Real: None,  # None for no constraint\r\n                 str: ['frobenius', 'kullback-leibler', 'itakura-saito']}\r\n```\r\nSometimes a parameter can only be positive or within a given interval, e.g. `l1_ratio` of `LogisticRegression` must be between 0 and 1, which would give\r\n```\r\nvalid_options = {numbers.Real: Interval(0, 1, closed='both')}\r\n```\r\npositivity of e.g. `max_iter` would be `numbers.Integral: Interval(left=1)`.\n"
