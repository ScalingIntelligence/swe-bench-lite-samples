What do you think about extending it across the code-base (or at least for new or recent estimators) ?\r\n\r\nCurrently parameter checking is not always done or often partially done, and is quite redundant. For instance, here is the input validation of lda:\r\n```python\r\ndef _check_params(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Check model parameters.\"\"\"\r\n        if self.n_components <= 0:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'n_components' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.n_components)\r\n\r\n        if self.total_samples <= 0:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'total_samples' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.total_samples)\r\n\r\n        if self.learning_offset < 0:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'learning_offset' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.learning_offset)\r\n\r\n        if self.learning_method not in (\"batch\", \"online\"):\r\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid 'learning_method' parameter: %r\"\r\n                             % self.learning_method)\r\n```\r\nmost params aren't checked and for those who are there's a lot of duplicated code.\r\n\r\nA propose to be upgrade the new tool to be able to check open/closed intervals (currently only closed) and list membership.\r\n\r\nThe api would be something like that:\r\n```\r\ncheck_param(param, name, valid_options)\r\n```\r\nwhere valid_options would be a dict of `type: constraint`. e.g for the `beta_loss` param of `NMF`, it can be either a float or a string in a list, which would give\r\n```\r\nvalid_options = {numbers.Real: None,  # None for no constraint\r\n                 str: ['frobenius', 'kullback-leibler', 'itakura-saito']}\r\n```\r\nSometimes a parameter can only be positive or within a given interval, e.g. `l1_ratio` of `LogisticRegression` must be between 0 and 1, which would give\r\n```\r\nvalid_options = {numbers.Real: Interval(0, 1, closed='both')}\r\n```\r\npositivity of e.g. `max_iter` would be `numbers.Integral: Interval(left=1)`.\n"
