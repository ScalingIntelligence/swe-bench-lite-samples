The focus is on the LaTeX rendering of the output, specifically how the brackets are escaped and the impact on rendering in markdown cells. The search results bring up the `LatexPrinter` class in SymPy's `latex.py` file, which contains methods that handle LaTeX printing for various SymPy objects, including sequences. The `_print_SeqFormula` method within `LatexPrinter` is particularly relevant as it constructs the LaTeX string for the sequence formula, including the use of backslash-escaped square brackets. This method directly addresses the issue in the reported issue by defining how the sequence formula is converted to LaTeX format, specifically showing the use of escaped square brackets. Therefore, the identified code span that deals with this conversion in `LatexPrinter` is pertinent to resolving the reported issue.",
