Specifically, the issue highlights that the LaTeX rendering of `SeqFormula` backslash-escapes the brackets, which causes improper rendering when copied to a markdown cell. The task requires identifying the relevant code responsible for the LaTeX and pretty printing of `SeqFormula` to address the issue with backslash-escaped brackets.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1. Reviewed the reported issue: Focus is on `SeqFormula` rendering in LaTeX with backslash-escaped brackets causing improper rendering.\n2. Current file context: No relevant code has been identified yet.\n3. Analyzing new search results:\n   - From `sympy/printing/latex.py`, identified the `LatexPrinter` class with a method `_print_SeqFormula` that formats `SeqFormula` for LaTeX output.\n   - From `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, noted a class `PrettyPrinter` but no specific method for `_print_SeqFormula`. This might not be directly relevant unless we need to assess generic printing behavior.\n   - From `sympy/series/sequences.py`, found the `SeqFormula` class definition which defines the `SeqFormula` itself but does not directly deal with printing issues.\n\nRelevant code spans:\n- From `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula`, this method directly deals with the LaTeX printing of `SeqFormula` and constructs the LaTeX output string that includes the backslash-escaped brackets. This method is highly relevant to address the issue as modifying the way brackets are handled here should resolve the reported issue.\n\nDecision to use the `Identify` function with the relevant code spans found in `sympy/printing/latex.py`.",

The current file context points to the `LatexPrinter` class and its method `_print_SeqFormula`, which is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of the sequence formula. This method currently uses `r'\\left\\[...' to format the output, which is likely causing the backslash-escaping issue. The search results further confirm the existence of the `SeqFormula` class and its related methods in `sympy/series/sequences.py`. These results include methods like `__new__`, `formula`, `_eval_coeff`, `_add`, `_mul`, and `coeff_mul` for the `SeqFormula` class, which are relevant to understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of sequence formulas.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to identify where the backslash-escaping occurs and determine if it's necessary or if it can be adjusted to avoid the undesired escaping of brackets. The `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` method might be the best place to start investigating and potentially modifying the LaTeX generation to avoid backslash-escaping specific characters like square brackets.",

The method constructs the LaTeX representation of the sequence by including up to the first four elements, followed by an ellipsis if the sequence is infinite or longer than four elements. The sequence elements are enclosed in escaped square brackets (\\left\\[ and \\right\\]). This behavior is likely the source of the issue, where the escaped brackets are causing rendering problems in environments that do not expect such escaping.
