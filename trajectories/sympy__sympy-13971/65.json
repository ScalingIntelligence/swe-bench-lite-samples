Specifically, the problem is that the LaTeX output from `SeqFormula()` backslash-escapes the square brackets, which results in improper rendering when copied to a markdown cell. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code in the SymPy codebase that handles the LaTeX printing of `SeqFormula()`. The search results provided include the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, which is likely where the LaTeX printing logic for SymPy objects resides. Within this file, there is a `LatexPrinter` class that contains a method `_print_SeqFormula`. This method is specifically designed to handle the LaTeX printing of sequences defined by `SeqFormula`. The method constructs the LaTeX representation of the sequence, which includes the backslash-escaped square brackets. Since the issue is directly related to how `SeqFormula` is being printed in LaTeX, the method `_print_SeqFormula` is the relevant code span that needs to be addressed to fix the issue.",
