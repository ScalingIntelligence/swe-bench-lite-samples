Specifically, the issue is that the LaTeX output of `SeqFormula` backslash-escapes the square brackets, which does not render properly when copied to a markdown cell. The relevant part of the issue is that the sequence output should not backslash-escape square brackets, or the `\\]` should render properly. The search results include relevant code spans in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. In `LatexPrinter`, the method `_print_SeqFormula` contains the code responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of `SeqFormula`. This method constructs the LaTeX output using `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]`, which aligns with the issue of backslash-escaping the brackets. This span is identified as relevant due to its relationship with the reported issue. Additionally, in `PrettyPrinter`, there is a `_print_SeqFormula` method that handles the pretty printing of `SeqFormula`. While this method does not directly impact the LaTeX escaping issue, it is relevant because it provides context on how `SeqFormula` is handled in different printing formats. However, the primary focus is on the `LatexPrinter` method as it directly addresses the LaTeX escaping issue.",
