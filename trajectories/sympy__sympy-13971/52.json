The key element to identify here is the handling and rendering of square brackets in LaTeX output. Therefore, the focus should be on the LaTeX printing module of SymPy where the SeqFormula class is being printed. From the search results, the relevant code span is identified in the LatexPrinter class within the _print_SeqFormula method. This method is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of the SeqFormula object, and it explicitly uses backslash-escaped square brackets which matches the observed issue. The other spans in the sequences.py file, particularly those relating to the SeqFormula class, provide context on how SeqFormula objects are defined and processed, but they do not directly address the LaTeX output formatting concerns brought up in the issue.",
