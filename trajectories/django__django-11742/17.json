The search results provide several relevant code spans: \n1. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the class `Field` and its `__init__` method are defined, which includes the parameters `max_length` and `choices`. This is the primary class where the functionality needs to be added. Specifically, the `Field.__init__` span is crucial for understanding how `max_length` and `choices` are initially set up.\n2. Also in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field._check_choices` method is used to validate if the choices are in the correct format. This method could potentially be extended to include a check for the length of the values against `max_length`.\n3. The `CharField` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is a specialized version of `Field` that has additional validators for `max_length`. Understanding how `CharField` handles `max_length` could be beneficial for designing the new check.\n\nFor the `django/forms/fields.py` results, the `CharField` class in this file focuses on form-specific validation and attributes related to `max_length`. This provides another perspective on how `max_length` is treated in a different context, which could be considered when implementing the new check.\n\nThe identified spans provide a comprehensive view of where and how `max_length` and `choices` interact in the codebase. This context will be useful for implementing the new check to ensure `max_length` fits the longest choice.",

Specifically, the CharField definition in both `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/forms/fields.py` includes parameters for `max_length` and `choices`. There are methods related to checking the `max_length` attribute and choices in the model field context. However, the key requirement of adding a check to ensure that `Field.max_length` fits the longest choice from `Field.choices` is not explicitly addressed in either file context. The existing validators for `max_length` in both contexts do not check against the longest choice in `choices`, suggesting that implementing such a check would require additional code. Furthermore, there isn't a specific method or validation step in the provided context that explicitly confirms or adjusts `max_length` based on the longest choice in `choices`. The file context thus seems incomplete regarding the implementation details required to address the reported issue directly.",
