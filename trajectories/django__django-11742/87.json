To address this, we need to focus on the Field class and its subclasses, particularly CharField, as it has a max_length attribute and often uses choices. The search results include relevant spans for CharField, such as its initialization (__init__), the check method, and the method to check the max_length attribute (_check_max_length_attribute). These spans are crucial for understanding how max_length is currently validated and how choices are handled, which are directly related to the issue at hand. Further, the inclusion of other subclasses like CommaSeparatedIntegerField, EmailField, SlugField, and URLField confirms that the search is comprehensive across various field types that might use max_length and choices. This analysis suggests that the identified spans are relevant to addressing the issue and implementing the required check.",
