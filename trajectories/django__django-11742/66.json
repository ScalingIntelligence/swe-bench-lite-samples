To address this, I analyzed the relevant code spans in the search results. The most relevant span is 'Field.__init__', where the max_length and choices attributes are initialized. This is crucial because it shows where we could potentially add logic to ensure max_length fits the longest choice. Additionally, 'Field.check' provides a place where various checks are performed, suggesting it could be the ideal location to add the new check. Furthermore, 'CharField.__init__' and 'CharField.check' confirm that max_length is relevant for CharField and would also benefit from the new check. Considering these, the identified spans directly relate to initializing, setting, and checking the max_length attribute and choices. This encompasses the core functionality needed to implement the requirement stated in the issue.",
