The main areas of interest are the '__init__' methods and any related validation or check methods. Specifically, 'Field.__init__' initializes the max_length and choices attributes, making it a prime candidate for adding a new check. Additionally, 'Field._check_choices' currently validates the structure of choices but does not evaluate them against max_length. Similarly, 'CharField.__init__' and 'CharField._check_max_length_attribute' deal with max_length validation but do not currently consider the choices for length validation. The 'ChoiceField' class in the 'forms' module also requires inspection, though it does not directly handle max_length as it's more focused on form-level validations rather than model field definitions.",
