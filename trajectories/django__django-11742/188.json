Specifically, we need to identify where `max_length` is initialized and validated. The `__init__` method in `CharField` for both models and forms initializes the `max_length` and applies validators, and the `_check_max_length_attribute` method in models performs checks on the `max_length` attribute. These sections are crucial for implementing a check that iterates over the choices to ensure `max_length` is sufficient for the longest choice value. We should ensure that the check is applied at the point where the field is initialized or validated.
