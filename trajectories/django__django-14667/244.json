            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the behavior of the `defer()` and `only()` methods in Django's `QuerySet`. When chaining these methods, the SQL query generated selects unexpected fields. For instance, `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")` should ideally select only the 'id' field, but instead, it selects all fields. This suggests that the logic in the `defer()` and `only()` methods might not be correctly handling the chaining of these methods. To address this, we should focus our search on the `QuerySet` class in the `django/db/models/query.py` file, where the `defer()` and `only()` methods are defined, as well as in related SQL query handling classes like `Query` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `SQLCompiler` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`.",

The relevant code spans to examine are those that set, add, or clear deferred loading and immediate loading states within the query object. We should also consider the Query class's deferred_to_data method, which processes the deferred loading logic, as it might play a crucial role in the final SQL query generation reflecting the deferred or immediate loading state of fields.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
