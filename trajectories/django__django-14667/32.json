This indicates a problem in the logic that handles the interaction between `defer()` and `only()` methods.\n\nGiven the description, I need to identify the code spans in `django/db/models/query.py` that handle the `defer()` and `only()` methods and check how they interact with each other. The reported issue suggests that there may be a flaw in either the way deferred fields are cleared or how immediate loading fields are added, particularly when these methods are chained.\n\nI will examine the `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods as well as their interactions within the `QuerySet` class. In the search results, 'QuerySet.defer' modifies the query by adding deferred loading fields and 'QuerySet.only' by adding immediate loading fields. The issue implies there may be an error in how these fields are processed when they are chained.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will identify the relevant spans ('QuerySet.defer' and 'QuerySet.only') since they directly handle the methods mentioned in the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the functionality of `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` in Django's ORM, specifically when chaining these methods. The issue is that when `defer()` is called after `only()`, the SQL query generated includes all fields rather than the expected deferred fields. This behavior is evident in the provided examples, where `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")` and `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")` both select all fields. This suggests that the logic handling the interplay between deferred and immediate loading fields in the `Query` class may be flawed.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans, the relevant methods are `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()`, which handle the addition of deferred and immediate loading fields, respectively. These methods interact with the `Query` class methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()`. The `Query` class also has methods like `clear_deferred_loading()`, which manage the deferred loading state. These methods should be closely examined to ensure they correctly manage the state between deferred and immediate loading fields. Additionally, the `Query.deferred_to_data()` method involves converting deferred fields to data, which might also be relevant.\n\nThe search results do not reveal any directly conflicting logic between `defer()` and `only()`, but they do show the code managing deferred loading states. The assessment is that the provided code spans are relevant to addressing the issue, but deeper investigation into how `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` interact with the query state is necessary. Therefore, the search should continue to ensure all relevant code relating to deferred and immediate loading in both the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes is examined.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
