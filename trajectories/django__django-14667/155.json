            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the behavior of the QuerySet methods `defer()` and `only()` and how they interact when chained together. The specific problem is that chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not produce the expected SQL query, where only certain fields are selected. Instead, it ends up selecting all fields. This suggests an issue with how deferred loading is managed when switching between `only()` and `defer()`. \n\nUpon examining the provided code spans, particularly in `django/db/models/query.py`, we can see the implementation of `defer()` and `only()` methods. These methods manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute of the `Query` class. The `defer()` method adds fields to the deferred list, while the `only()` method sets the immediate loading list. However, the implementation does not handle the transition between deferred and immediate loading states adequately, especially when they are called in sequence. \n\nIn `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` methods are responsible for updating the `deferred_loading` property. The `deferred_to_data()` method is also relevant, as it manipulates the fields based on the deferred loading settings. The `add_to_dict()` helper function supports updating a dictionary with model fields.\n\nIn `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, the `deferred_to_columns()` method uses the `deferred_to_data()` from the query to determine which columns should be included in the final SQL statement. This method is critical for determining the final field selection in a query.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the analysis of the provided code, the main areas of focus are the `defer()`, `only()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, `add_immediate_loading()`, and `deferred_to_data()` methods. These methods and attributes need to be carefully examined and potentially adjusted to ensure that the deferred fields are managed correctly when switching between `only()` and `defer()` calls. Specifically, the code needs to handle the transition states more effectively to prevent unexpected loading of all fields.",

Both the QuerySet class and the Query class play crucial roles in handling the .defer() and .only() methods. The methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() in the Query class manage the deferred and immediate loading of fields, respectively. The deferred_to_data() method also processes the deferred loading strategy.\n\nThe search results contain code spans that are directly related to the issue, including QuerySet.defer(), QuerySet.only(), and the underlying methods in the Query class like add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading(). These methods appear consistent across the provided context and search results, indicating that the search is already covering the relevant parts of the codebase.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
