Specifically, it mentions that when defer() is called after only(), it doesn't clear the deferred fields as expected. This behavior can be traced back to the implementation of these methods in the QuerySet class and their interaction with the Query class. The relevant code spans to look at are the methods defer() and only() in the QuerySet class, and the methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() in the Query class. These methods handle how deferred and immediate fields are managed during query construction. Analyzing these methods will help understand why the described behavior occurs and possibly identify where the logic might need adjustments to achieve the expected behavior. Additionally, the init method of the Query class is also relevant as it initializes the deferred_loading attribute, which is central to this issue. Finally, the deferred_to_columns method in the SQLCompiler class is worth noting as it relates to how deferred columns are processed during SQL compilation, although it seems less directly related to the issue at hand compared to the methods in the Query and QuerySet classes. Based on this analysis, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
