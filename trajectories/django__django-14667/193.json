The methods of interest are QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only(). In both methods, there is logic to handle deferred and immediate loading of fields. The issue seems to arise from how the interaction between these two methods is handled internally. \n\nFor example, the defer() method calls clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields), and the only() method calls clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields). It appears that the internal state of the Query object might not be correctly updating to reflect the combination of defer and only calls, leading to the selection of all fields in the SQL query.

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
