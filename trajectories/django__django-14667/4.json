Specifically, when .defer('name') follows .only('name'), it results in the selection of all fields instead of only the non-deferred fields. This indicates a possible bug in the handling of deferred and immediate field loading logic within the QuerySet and SQL query construction. Given the provided context, the relevant parts of the Django codebase are likely in the db/models/query.py and db/models/sql/query.py files, focusing on the defer() and only() methods and their interaction within the QuerySet class and Query class, respectively. Additionally, SQLCompiler in db/models/sql/compiler.py could be involved in how the SQL query is compiled from the Query object.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
