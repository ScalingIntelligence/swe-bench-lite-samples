The `defer()` method adds fields to the deferred loading set, while the `only()` method sets the immediate loading fields. The issue indicates that chaining these methods does not behave as expected, particularly when it comes to the SQL query generated. The provided code spans include the methods `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, which are central to the reported issue. These methods handle the deferred and immediate loading of fields, affecting the SQL query generated by the `SQLCompiler`. By examining these methods, we can identify potential areas where the logic might fail to correctly handle field exclusion or inclusion, leading to the unexpected SQL query results described in the issue. This analysis will help in understanding the current implementation and guiding any necessary changes to achieve the expected behavior when chaining `defer()` and `only()` methods.",

These methods are directly related to managing the deferred and immediate loading of fields in Django's ORM, which is the core issue reported. The deferred_loading attribute in the Query class is key to understanding how field exclusion and inclusion are managed. Despite the presence of these methods and attributes, the actual logic that handles the interaction and resolution of fields when chaining .defer() and .only() methods is not fully detailed in the provided context. This could be crucial in determining why the SQL query includes unexpected fields after chaining these methods.

The methods defer() and only() in QuerySet both manipulate the deferred_loading attribute of the Query object, which is a tuple containing a set of field names and a boolean indicating whether those fields are to be deferred (True) or immediately loaded (False). The add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() methods in the Query class update this attribute based on the fields specified in the defer() and only() calls, respectively. These methods handle the logic for adding or removing fields from the set of deferred or immediate fields, and they ensure that the 'pk' (primary key) is always included in the immediate loading set. This setup is crucial for forming the SELECT clause of the SQL query, as it dictates which fields are included based on whether they are deferred or not. While the code provided does not show the exact construction of the SELECT clause, it does illuminate the process by which field inclusion is determined before SQL compilation.",

The provided context and search results contain relevant code spans that address how `defer()` and `only()` methods are implemented within the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class, which handles the SQL generation.\n\nThe context provides detailed implementations of `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, and related methods such as `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`. These methods are critical for understanding how field deferral and immediate loading are handled, and how they might interact in unexpected ways when chained.\n\nFrom the search results, additional relevant methods such as `Query.clear_deferred_loading()`, `Query.deferred_to_data()`, and others are identified. These additional methods are part of the `Query` class and deal with the management of deferred and immediate loading of fields, which directly relate to the issue described. The full context of the methods is necessary to understand how chaining `defer()` and `only()` might lead to the observed SQL behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified to include all methods directly related to field deferral and immediate loading as they pertain to the `Query` class, which is responsible for generating SQL queries in Django's ORM.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
