This involves a Company model with fields: id, name, trade_number, and country. The issue is that calling .defer() after .only() doesn't clear the deferred field as expected, resulting in the selection of all fields in the SQL query. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'deferral' and 'eager loading' methods of the QuerySet class: __init__, defer, and only. These methods handle the management of deferred and immediate loading of fields in the queryset. The .only() method adds fields to the immediate loading list, while the .defer() method adds fields to the deferred loading list. The issue seems to be related to how these methods interact when chained together. Thus, these methods are relevant to identifying the cause and potential fix for the reported issue.",

The issue specifically points out unexpected behavior when chaining .defer() after .only() in a QuerySet. This discrepancy in expected and actual SQL query output indicates a potential bug in the query construction logic or in the management of deferred and immediate loading fields. Given the file context and the search results, it's evident that the initial file context provided includes methods from the QuerySet class like defer() and only(), which are directly related to the reported issue. The subsequent search results in the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file further support this relevance with methods like clear_deferred_loading(), add_deferred_loading(), and add_immediate_loading(), which manage the deferred and immediate loading of fields in the Query object. Additionally, the SQLCompiler class's deferred_to_columns() method in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' is also pertinent as it deals with converting deferred field loads into columns. These methods and classes are crucial for determining how Django handles field selection for SQL queries, thus directly addressing the reported issue. Each captured span in these files is assessed for relevance based on their potential to contribute to or illuminate the problems around field handling during query execution as described in the issue. This comprehensive analysis ensures that all relevant parts of the codebase are thoroughly reviewed to accurately portray the current state of field management and potential issues.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
