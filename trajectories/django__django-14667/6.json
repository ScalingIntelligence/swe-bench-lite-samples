Specifically, it's mentioned that when chaining `.defer()` after `.only()`, the generated SQL query selects unexpected fields. This issue directly relates to the `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods in Django's `django/db/models/query.py` file, as well as the handling of deferred and immediate loading in the `Query` class of `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.\n\nThe code spans provided in the search results include the definitions of `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, and the related methods in the `Query` class (`Query.clear_deferred_loading()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`). These methods are responsible for managing which fields are deferred or immediately loaded in the query. The issue seems to stem from how these methods interact when chaining, particularly the order in which they are called.\n\nThe provided code spans appear to cover the necessary parts of the codebase relevant to the reported issue. The `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods are the main points of interaction, and the `Query` class methods handle the actual deferred loading logic. It seems that the interaction between these components is not correctly handling the toggling between deferred and immediate loading when methods are chained. The provided code spans are sufficient to investigate and potentially fix the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
