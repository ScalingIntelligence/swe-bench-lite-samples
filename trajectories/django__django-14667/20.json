Specifically, when `defer()` follows `only()`, it does not clear the deferred fields as expected, leading to SQL queries that select more fields than necessary. To address this, we need to examine the relevant code in the `QuerySet` class, specifically the methods `defer()` and `only()`. Additionally, we should check how deferred loading is managed in the `Query` class or related handling, potentially in methods like `add_deferred_loading` or `clear_deferred_loading`. The provided search results include the `QuerySet` class definition with both the `defer()` and `only()` methods, which are immediately relevant to the issue. There is also a reference to `add_deferred_loading` and `clear_deferred_loading` in the `QuerySet.defer()` method, which suggest that these methods might be crucial for resolving the issue. Further examination of these methods and their interactions within the `QuerySet` class and possibly the `Query` class is necessary to fully understand the problem and identify potential fixes.",

To address this, I've analyzed the existing code spans related to QuerySet, defer, and only methods, as well as the Query class methods handling deferred and immediate loading. The relevant spans include: 1. 'QuerySet.defer' and 'QuerySet.only' in 'django/db/models/query.py' which show how defer and only methods are implemented in the QuerySet class, including checks and how they chain new QuerySet clones, 2. 'Query.add_deferred_loading' and 'Query.add_immediate_loading' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' which reveal the internal mechanisms for handling deferred and immediate loading of field names by the Query class. These methods are crucial for understanding how the field selection is managed when using .defer() and .only(). Furthermore, considering the issue's context, it seems that there might be a logic flaw when combining these methods, possibly around how the deferred_loading attribute is being updated, manipulated, or interpreted during these operations. Identifying these specific spans will help understand and potentially debug or modify the behavior to meet the expectation as reported.",

Specifically, it notes that when using `defer()` after `only()`, the deferred fields are not properly excluded from the SQL query, leading to the selection of unexpected fields. This is evident in the provided code spans where the `defer()` and `only()` methods set the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class, but there doesn't appear to be a mechanism to ensure that the deferred fields are correctly excluded when both methods are used in sequence. The current implementation might not handle the combination of these methods correctly, as evidenced by the examples provided in the issue description. The search results indicate that the relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, where the `Query` class methods `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` are defined. These methods control which fields are deferred or immediately loaded, but it seems they might not account for the order or combination of `defer()` and `only()` calls appropriately, leading to the observed SQL query behavior. Further investigation into how these methods interact and how the `deferred_loading` attribute is processed in the context of chained calls is likely necessary to resolve the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
