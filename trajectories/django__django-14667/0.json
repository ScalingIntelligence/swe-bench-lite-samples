The expected behavior is for the SQL query to only select the fields that are not deferred, but the current implementation results in the selection of all fields. To address this, we need to examine the code handling defer() and only() methods in 'django/db/models/query.py' and how these methods update the deferred_loading attribute in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py'. The relevant code spans in 'query.py' are the definitions of `QuerySet.defer`, `QuerySet.only`, `Query.add_deferred_loading`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading`, as these oversee the addition of deferred and immediate loading fields, which should help in understanding the root cause and guiding the fix for the reported issue. Additionally, a look into 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' might provide insight into how deferred fields are handled when compiling the SQL query, though there's no specific span in there related to the issue at hand so it's not part of the relevant code for now.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
