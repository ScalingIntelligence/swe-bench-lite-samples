The search results provided contain relevant code spans from `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These spans include the definitions of `QuerySet` class with methods `defer()` and `only()`, as well as the `Query` class with methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()`. These methods are directly related to the mechanism of deferring and directly loading fields in the Django ORM. The provided code spans show the internal logic of how these methods work, including how they manipulate the `self.deferred_loading` attribute, which controls which fields are deferred or directly loaded. This analysis helps in identifying the exact points in the code where the issue might arise when `.defer()` is used after `.only()`. Given the context and the nature of the reported issue, these spans are highly relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
