The main problem is that when 'defer()' is chained after 'only()', the deferred fields are not actually deferred, and all fields are selected in the SQL query. This contradicts the expected behavior where only specific fields should be selected. The search results contain critical parts of the Django ORM code related to these methods. Specifically, the 'QuerySet' class has the 'defer()' and 'only()' methods, which are responsible for marking fields as deferred or immediately loaded, respectively. The 'Query' class handles the internal state of which fields are deferred or immediately loaded through methods like 'add_deferred_loading()' and 'add_immediate_loading()'. The 'SQLCompiler' class appears to be involved in the actual SQL compilation process but does not directly address the issue at hand. This analysis indicates that the core issue likely lies within the interaction between the 'defer()' and 'only()' methods in the 'QuerySet' class and their impact on the 'Query' class state. Further investigation may require deeper understanding of how these methods interact and modify the state of the 'Query' object.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
