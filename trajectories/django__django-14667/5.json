I will analyze the provided code spans to identify where the problem might lie and find relevant code spans that could be involved in fixing this issue.\n\nFirst, let's look at the QuerySet class and its methods .defer() and .only(). Both methods manipulate the deferred_loading property of the Query object. The .defer() method adds fields to the deferred loading set, while the .only() method sets the immediate loading set by adjusting this property. However, it doesn't handle the case where the .defer() method is called after .only(). This could be the source of the issue.\n\nNext, I need to verify how the deferred_loading property is managed in the Query class. The methods responsible for this are add_deferred_loading(), add_immediate_loading(), and clear_deferred_loading(). These methods control which fields are deferred or immediately loaded.\n\nGiven the issue described, it seems the chaining of .defer() after .only() should ideally clear the immediate loading set affected by .only() and maintain the deferred set from .defer(). However, this does not seem to be happening based on the current implementation.\n\nI will identify the relevant code spans that handle the deferred_loading property updates and the logic that governs the SQL field selections to pinpoint the areas likely needing adjustment to address the reported issue.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
