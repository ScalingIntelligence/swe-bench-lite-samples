The relevant code spans are those that handle the logic for deferred and immediate loading of fields. By examining the `defer` and `only` methods in the `QuerySet` class, as well as the `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods in the `Query` class, we can determine how these methods currently handle field selection and whether they correctly interact with each other.\n\n1. **QuerySet.defer()**: This method is responsible for marking specified fields as deferred, meaning they should not be loaded from the database unless explicitly accessed. It calls `add_deferred_loading` on the query object.\n\n2. **QuerySet.only()**: This method is intended to load only the specified fields immediately, deferring all other fields. It calls `add_immediate_loading` on the query object.\n\n3. **Query.add_deferred_loading()**: This method updates the set of fields that are deferred based on whether the current setting is to defer fields or to load them immediately.\n\n4. **Query.add_immediate_loading()**: This method updates the set of fields that should be loaded immediately, adjusting for any existing deferred fields and ensuring the primary key (pk) is always included if specified.\n\nBy analyzing these spans of code, we can see that there is potential for conflict when `defer()` follows `only()` or when both methods are used multiple times in a chain. The issue likely arises from how these methods update the internal state of the query object related to deferred and immediate loading.",

Specifically, it is noted that chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not produce the expected SQL query where only specific fields are selected. Instead, all fields are loaded despite the `defer()` call.\n\nGiven the context and the code spans provided, the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be examined are those related to the `defer` and `only` methods within the `QuerySet` class, as well as the `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods in the `Query` class. These methods are responsible for handling the deferred and immediate loading of model fields.\n\nThe current implementation of `defer()` and `only()` in `QuerySet` already interacts with `Query`'s methods for handling deferred loading, but the issue suggests a miscalculation when these methods are chained. Specifically, the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class seems to be where the logic for handling field selection resides. The `deferred_to_data` method, which processes these deferred field settings, may also play a crucial role in determining the final set of fields to be loaded by the SQL query.\n\nReviewing the entire sections of code related to these methods and their interactions should be sufficient to identify the root cause of the issue and determine if additional changes or fixes are necessary.",
