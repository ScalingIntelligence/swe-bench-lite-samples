The expectation is that calling `.defer()` after `.only()` should not load all fields unless explicitly specified, but the current implementation seems to not adhere to this expectation. The current context and search results provide insights into the implementation of these methods and related functionalities within Django's ORM.\n\nFrom the context provided:\n- `QuerySet` class contains methods `defer()` and `only()`, which manipulate the deferred loading of fields.\n- The `Query` class handles the addition of deferred and immediate loading fields using methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` respectively.\n- The `SQLCompiler` class in the search results is responsible for generating SQL queries based on the state of the `Query` object, including how it handles deferred fields.\n\nAnalyzing the search results:\n- The `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` method determines the columns to be included in the SQL query based on the deferred loading states. This method could be critical for addressing the issue since it constructs the SELECT clause of the SQL query.\n- The `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()` method aids in processing deferred loading instructions into a format that `get_default_columns()` can use.\n\nGiven the issue and the relevant code spans, the identified spans in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` are likely relevant to addressing the issue.

Additionally, the `Query` class contains methods such as `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` which manage the state of the deferred loading. The `SQLCompiler` class within the same context builds on these states to determine the columns to be included in the SQL query through methods like `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()`. Although the complete system to translate these lists into SQL is not fully detailed due to the broad scope of the Django codebase, the context provided identifies the key components needed to address the issue regarding the handling of deferred and immediate loading in the SQL query generation process.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
