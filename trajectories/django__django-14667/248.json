            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that the QuerySet methods .defer() and .only() do not interact as expected when chained together. Specifically, chaining .defer() after .only() results in an SQL query that selects all fields instead of the expected subset. This suggests a problem in how the deferred and immediate loading of fields is handled within the QuerySet and Query classes.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the relevant code spans can be found in two main files: django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py. In query.py, the QuerySet class methods .defer() and .only() are clearly defined. These methods manipulate the deferred_loading attribute of the Query object to control which fields are deferred and which are loaded immediately.\n\nIn query.py, the methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() are responsible for updating the deferred_loading attribute. It's observed that these methods manipulate a tuple where the first element is a set of field names and the second element is a boolean indicating whether the loading is deferred or immediate.\n\nIn query.py, the .defer() method adds fields to the deferred list and the .only() method attempts to clear the deferred list and add fields to the immediate loading list. The problem might be arising from the way these methods interact with each other or how the deferred_loading attribute is handled in the Query class.\n\nIn query.py, the deferred_to_data() method in the Query class processes the deferred_loading attribute to determine which fields should be loaded or deferred. This method seems critical for resolving the issue, as it interprets the state set up by .defer() and .only() methods.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are directly related to the issue. They include the methods in QuerySet that control field loading behavior (.defer() and .only()) and the methods in the Query class that process these settings (add_deferred_loading(), add_immediate_loading(), and deferred_to_data()). These are the key points where the expected behavior of deferred and immediate loading of fields can be adjusted to fix the reported issue.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
