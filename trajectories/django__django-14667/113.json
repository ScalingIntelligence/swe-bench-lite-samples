Specifically, the issue highlights that when `defer()` follows `only()`, the deferred field is not cleared as expected, and the generated SQL query selects more fields than intended. This is evident from the example provided where `Company.objects.only('name').defer('name')` loads all fields instead of only the `id` field as expected. The code analysis should therefore concentrate on the `QuerySet` class methods `defer()` and `only()`. The `QuerySet.defer()` method adds fields to deferred loading while `QuerySet.only()` adds fields to immediate loading. The interplay between these methods and their modifying effects on the query object should be examined to identify the root cause of the problem. Furthermore, the methods `_chain()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()` which are called within `defer()` and `only()` may also be relevant to determine the flow and modification of the query.",

This suggests an issue in how the QuerySet methods handle field selection when chaining these methods.\n\nI analyzed the provided code spans from the search results which include the implementations for QuerySet.__init__, QuerySet._chain, QuerySet.defer, and QuerySet.only methods. These methods are directly related to the issue, as they are responsible for field handling, particularly when chaining defer and only methods. However, the search results didn't provide the relevant sections of code that handle the actual effect of the chaining, like how deferred and immediate loading is added or affected during chaining.\n\nConsidering the context, we already have important methods defined and to find the complete set, we need to identify which spans are tightly coupled to the specific behavior. But since the primary fault in the described issue lies in the SQL query generation, which wasn't covered in these spans, I'll suggest we need to expand search to include possibly the compiler or SQL query construction methods to accurately assess the problem and related code spans. This search expansion targets sections which are directly involved in translating query object settings into an SQL statement. For instance, code segments related to SQL generation in the sql.compiler module or similar could be critical.",

This supports the main logic needed to understand and potentially fix the reported issue regarding unexpected field loading when chaining `defer()` with `only()`.
