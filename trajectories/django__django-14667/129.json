The expected behavior is that `defer()` should override or clear the fields specified in `only()`, but this is not happening, leading to unexpected SQL queries that select all fields instead of a subset. The relevant code spans in the search results are those that define the `defer()` and `only()` methods within the `QuerySet` class and the methods that manage deferred and immediate loading in the `Query` class. These methods are responsible for controlling which fields are included in the generated SQL query. The `QuerySet.defer()` method calls `Query.add_deferred_loading()` to add fields to the deferred list, and the `QuerySet.only()` method calls `Query.add_immediate_loading()` to add fields to the immediate loading list. The `Query.deferred_loading` attribute is used to manage these lists. The issue seems to arise because the logic for handling both deferred and immediate loading fields might not correctly interact, especially when both methods are chained as described in the issue. This analysis shows that the identified code spans should cover the necessary context to address the issue. Further investigation or debugging might be required to understand why the deferred field logic is not working as expected in the context of chained method calls.",

The `defer()` method accumulates fields in the deferred loading set, while the `only()` method attempts to clear this set and load only the specified fields. However, the observed issue suggests that the state of `deferred_loading` might not be properly updated or respected when the methods are chained. Specifically, the chained call `Company.objects.only('name').defer('name')` should theoretically result in only the `id` field being loaded, but it instead loads all fields. This indicates a potential issue with how the state is transitioned between the `only()` and `defer()` calls.

The observed issue occurs when `only()` is followed by `defer()` in chaining, suggesting that the state of `deferred_loading` might not be properly updated or respected. Specifically, the code in `QuerySet` demonstrates how `defer()` and `only()` manipulate `deferred_loading`, but the complication arises from the interplay between these methods. The `defer()` method continuously updates the deferred field set, while `only()` attempts to reset this set and only load the specified fields. The issue described indicates a potential oversight or bug in how these methods interact during chaining, leading to unexpected SQL queries that load more fields than intended. The provided file context includes the relevant methods and their manipulation of `deferred_loading`, suggesting that a detailed review of these interactions would be necessary to identify the exact cause and implement a fix.

Specifically, the `defer()` method in the QuerySet class adds fields to the deferred loading set, and the `only()` method manipulates this set based on its context. Analysis of the `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` methods in the Query class shows intended logic for managing these sets. However, the issue arises from the unexpected SQL query generated when chaining `only()` and `defer()`, indicating a potential bug in the state management of deferred loading across these methods. Further investigation into the state transition logic within these methods is necessary to fully understand and resolve the issue.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
