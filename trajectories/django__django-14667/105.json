Also, consider the `SQLCompiler` class that compiles the SQL query from the query set.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the behavior of the QuerySet's defer() and only() methods when chained together. The issue specifically mentions that the deferred fields are not being cleared as expected when using these methods in combination. To address this, I reviewed the relevant parts of the Django codebase that handle these methods. From the search results, I identified the implementations of defer() and only() within the QuerySet class (in `django/db/models/query.py`), as well as the methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() within the Query class (in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`). The analysis of these methods shows that when defer() and only() are called, they modify the deferred_loading attribute of the Query object, which represents the fields that should be deferred or immediately loaded. The issue seems to arise from how these methods interact when chained, specifically how the deferred_loading attribute is updated. The current implementation does not handle the combination of defer() and only() in a way that aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the SQLCompiler class (in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`) is also relevant as it is responsible for compiling the SQL query based on the state of the Query object, which includes the deferred_loading attribute. The method deferred_to_columns() is part of this compilation process and indicates that the way deferred columns are processed might also be a factor in the reported issue. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms at play when dealing with deferred and immediate loading of fields in Django's QuerySets, and they are directly relevant to the issue at hand.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
