This behavior affects the deferred field handling and results in SQL queries that select more fields than expected. The provided search results contain the relevant methods and their implementations within Django's QuerySet and Query classes:\n\n1. In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet` class has the methods `defer()` and `only()`. The `defer()` method modifies the query to defer loading specified fields, while the `only()` method specifies the fields to load immediately. The issue suggests that the interaction between these methods is not behaving as expected, especially when chaining them.\n\n2. In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `Query` class is responsible for the SQL query generation. The method `add_deferred_loading()` adjusts the deferred loading fields based on whether the fields are already deferred or not. This method seems to be crucial for handling which fields are deferred in the SQL query.\n\nTo address the reported issue, the focus should be on the interaction in `QuerySet` between `defer()` and `only()`, and how the deferred_loading attribute in the `Query` class is managed. The current implementation might not correctly update the set of deferred fields, leading to the problem observed in the SQL queries.\n\nBased on the provided code spans, the relevant code spans to investigate further are those handling the deferred and immediate loading fields in both `QuerySet` and `Query` classes.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
