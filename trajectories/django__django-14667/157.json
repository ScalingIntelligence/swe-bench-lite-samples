Specifically, the user expects that chaining defer() after only() should clear the previously deferred fields, but the SQL query generated includes unexpected fields. To address this, it's crucial to examine the implementation of these methods in the QuerySet class and the underlying Query class that handles the deferred loading logic. The provided code spans include the initialization, defer(), and only() methods of the QuerySet class, as well as the add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() methods of the Query class. These methods are critical for understanding how deferred fields are managed and how the SQL query is constructed. The analysis shows that the logic for handling deferred fields does not account for the chaining scenario described by the user, which leads to unexpected field selections in the SQL query.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
