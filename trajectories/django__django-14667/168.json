Specifically, it is observed that chaining `defer()` after `only()` results in unexpected field selections in the generated SQL query. This problem is crucial because it affects the intended optimization of the query, where `defer()` should exclude fields initialized by `only()`. To address this, I explored the relevant functions (`defer` and `only`) within the `QuerySet` class in django/db/models/query.py. The analysis of these methods shows their interaction with the query's `deferred_loading` and `immediate_loading` attributes, which seem central to understanding the issue further. The `QuerySet` class contains methods to add and clear deferred loading, but the logic doesn't appear to handle the order and interaction of these methods when called in sequence. This implies that the current implementation might be missing logic to reset or correctly interpret the deferred field list in the context of previously set immediate fields. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()` method in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py aligns with query compilation and might need adjustments to ensure correct handling of deferred columns in such scenarios.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
