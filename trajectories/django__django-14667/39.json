The user expects that calling `defer()` after `only()` (specifically `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")`) would result in a SQL query that only selects the 'id' field. Instead, the SQL query selects all fields, which is unexpected. To address this, I should look into the implementation of the `defer()` and `only()` methods within the QuerySet class and the Query class to understand how field selection is managed and why chaining these methods leads to the observed behavior.",

The problem centers on how these methods handle deferred and immediate loading of fields. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that pertain to these methods.\n\n1. Analyzing User Instructions:\nThe issue is clearly described, with examples of queryset chaining that do not yield the expected SQL results. The critical points are the behavior of defer() and only() methods when chained together, and how they should and do affect the SQL query.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\nNo prior context is provided, so the focus is entirely on the search results.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n   - First, the QuerySet class is inspected with spans for defer() and only() methods. These spans are directly related to the reported issue as they define the behavior of how fields are deferred or immediately loaded.\n   - Next, the Query class is inspected, focusing on methods like clear_deferred_loading(), add_deferred_loading(), and add_immediate_loading(). These methods are crucial for managing the deferred loading state of a query.\n\n   From the analysis, the relevant spans are those that directly deal with the defer() and only() methods in the QuerySet class and the underlying logic for managing deferred loading in the Query class.\n\n4. Respond Using the Function:\nBased on the analysis, the following spans are identified as relevant to the issue:\n   - QuerySet class spans for defer() and only() methods.\n   - Query class spans for clear_deferred_loading(), add_deferred_loading(), and add_immediate_loading().",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
