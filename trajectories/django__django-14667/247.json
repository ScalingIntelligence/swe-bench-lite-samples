The expected behavior is for the SQL query to select only the fields that are not deferred. However, in the given examples, all fields are being selected unexpectedly. To resolve this, we need to identify the logic in the `defer()` and `only()` methods in `QuerySet` and possibly their interaction within the `Query` class in the SQL module. Investigating the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes is crucial to understand and correct this behavior.",

Specifically, when chaining these methods, the SQL query generated does not reflect the expected behavior of clearing the deferred fields in certain scenarios. To address this, we need to focus on the relevant sections of the Django ORM code that handle these methods. From the search results, we can identify several key spans in the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class that deal with deferred loading and immediate loading of fields. These methods (`defer`, `only`, `add_deferred_loading`, `add_immediate_loading`) and their interactions within the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes are critical to understanding and potentially fixing the issue. The spans 'QuerySet.defer', 'QuerySet.only', 'Query.add_deferred_loading', and 'Query.add_immediate_loading' are directly related to the methods described in the issue and are likely where the problem lies. Additionally, the 'Query.deferred_to_data' method is also relevant as it processes the deferred fields. By focusing on these spans, we can better understand how the current logic leads to unexpected SQL queries and consider potential adjustments to achieve the desired behavior described in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
