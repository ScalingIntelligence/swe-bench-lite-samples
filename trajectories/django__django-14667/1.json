According to the issue, the SQL query generated includes all fields instead of only the expected ones.\n\nTo address this, I analyzed the provided search results in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. Within `QuerySet`, the `.defer()` method is responsible for handling deferred fields, and it chains the query using `self._chain()`. In `Query`, methods like `clear_deferred_loading()` and `add_deferred_loading()` manage the deferred loading of fields.\n\nConsidering the issue, it seems the problem might lie in how these methods interact when `.defer()` follows `.only()`. Both `QuerySet.defer()` and `Query.add_deferred_loading()` should be reviewed further to see if they correctly interpret and apply the deferred loading after an only() call. They both seem relevant as they directly handle the deferred field logic, which is central to the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
