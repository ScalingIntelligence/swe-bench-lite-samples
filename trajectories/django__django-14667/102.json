Specifically, the defer() and only() methods in QuerySet clearly manipulate the deferred_loading attribute of the Query class through add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading(). This ensures that the expected fields are deferred or loaded immediately based on method chaining. The add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() methods also handle the expected behavior when fields are specified in a manner that aligns with the issue description, supporting the logic for processing deferred and immediate fields. The SQLCompiler class and its methods are not directly provided in the context, but based on the identification of management logic in the Query class, it is reasonable to assume that further code within SQLCompiler would handle the SQL translation of these policies, contributing to the overall completeness of understanding the deferred field management.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
