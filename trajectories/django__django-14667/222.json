The issue describes unexpected behavior when chaining `defer()` after `only()`, particularly with respect to SQL query generation. We should focus on methods and attributes that manage deferred and immediate loading of fields, as well as how these settings might interact or be overwritten. Given the fragments provided, we can see `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, and `Query.add_deferred_loading()` are directly relevant to our needs. `QuerySet.__init__` might offer insights into the initial state setup, crucial for understanding how deferred and immediate field loading is managed. Additionally, `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()` could be relevant as it seems to handle columns based on deferred queries. By reviewing these sections, we can understand the logic Django uses for handling queries through deferred and immediate field management.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
