            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the behavior of Django's QuerySet methods `defer()` and `only()` when used in combination. Specifically, when `defer()` follows `only()`, the SQL query generated unexpectedly includes all fields instead of the expected subset. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the codebase.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided search results, several key methods are identified that are directly related to this issue: `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`. These methods are responsible for managing the deferred and immediate loading of fields in the QuerySet.\n\nThe `QuerySet.defer()` method adds fields to the deferred loading list, while the `QuerySet.only()` method adds fields to the immediate loading list. The methods in the `Query` class handle the actual logic for deferred and immediate loading by updating the `deferred_loading` attribute.\n\nGiven the issue description, it's evident that these methods are not handling the combinations as expected. The issue likely lies within the logic that updates the `deferred_loading` attribute when both `defer()` and `only()` are used in sequence. The interplay between these methods needs to be carefully examined to ensure the SQL query respects the chained method calls.\n\nTo address the issue, one approach could be to modify the logic in `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` to ensure that the `deferred_loading` attribute accurately reflects the intended fields to be deferred or immediately loaded. Additionally, the `Query` class methods should be reviewed to ensure that they correctly interpret the `deferred_loading` attribute and generate the appropriate SQL query.\n\nIn conclusion, the identified code spans are directly related to the reported issue, and further investigation and modification of these methods are necessary to resolve the problem.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
