Specifically, it describes how using `defer()` after `only()` does not produce the expected SQL queries, i.e., not clearing the deferred fields as expected. This problem is detailed with specific examples using a `Company` model and different chaining scenarios of `defer()` and `only()`. From the search results, it is evident that both methods (`defer()` and `only()`) manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute of the `Query` class. The `QuerySet.defer()` method calls `add_deferred_loading()` on the query object to add fields to the deferred loading list, while `QuerySet.only()` calls `add_immediate_loading()` to add fields to the immediate loading list. However, the current implementation does not handle the interaction between these methods correctly, leading to the described behavior. Specifically, the `deferred_loading` attribute modification in `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` does not account for changes to fields already either deferred or immediately loaded, which is likely causing the issue. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class methods and the `QuerySet` methods that interact with these attributes.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
