The issue specifically focuses on how the defer() and only() methods handle field selection when chained together. The provided code spans include the definitions of the defer and only methods in the QuerySet class, which interact with the Query class to manage deferred and immediate loading of fields. Additionally, the Query class methods add_deferred_loading and add_immediate_loading are crucial for understanding how field selection is managed internally. These methods are key to determining the correct SQL query generated when chaining .defer() and .only(). Specifically, the issue points out that chaining .defer() after .only() results in the selection of unexpected fields, suggesting a potential bug or missing logic in the interaction between these methods. The code review should focus on how deferred_loading and immediate_loading are handled when methods are chained, ensuring that correct field selections are made and the SQL query reflects the intended field inclusion or exclusion. This careful examination should help identify any gaps or inconsistencies in handling these chaining scenarios.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
