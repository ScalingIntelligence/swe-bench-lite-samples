The unexpected SQL query results occur when chaining these methods, which can lead to the retrieval of more fields than intended. The majority of relevant code for this issue seems to be within the django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py files, particularly focusing on the defer() and only() methods in the QuerySet class and related methods in the Query class. Additionally, methods in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py might handle SQL compilation aspects that could interact with or influence how the select clause is formed. It's necessary to look into the specific implementations of these methods for insights into the behavior.",

The examples provided highlight that even when deferring fields after specifying only certain fields, the SQL query selects all fields instead of the expected ones. To address this, we need to examine the relevant methods in the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class. The `QuerySet.only()` and `QuerySet.defer()` methods in `django/db/models/query.py` are crucial as they handle immediate loading and deferred loading of fields, respectively. Additionally, the `Query.add_immediate_loading()` and `Query.add_deferred_loading()` methods in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` manage the internal state of what fields are to be loaded immediately and which are deferred. It's important to ensure that when `defer()` is called after `only()`, the deferred fields are correctly handled without reinstating fields that were meant to be excluded. Moreover, the `Query.deferred_to_data()` method is responsible for managing which fields are to be loaded based on the deferred loading settings, and thus, it should be examined to ensure it processes the deferred fields correctly when chained operations occur.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
