This indicates a potential bug or unintended interaction between these methods in Django's ORM. To address this, it's crucial to: \n1. Identify the method definitions for `defer()` and `only()` in the QuerySet class in `django/db/models/query.py`. \n2. Examine how these methods interact with the SQL query generation process by looking at relevant methods in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` such as `combine()`, `deferred_to_data()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`. \n3. Consider how SQLCompiler in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` processes these settings to generate the final SQL query. \n4. Ensure that the logic handling deferred and immediate field loading accurately reflects the intended behavior and does not inadvertently include all fields when `defer()` and `only()` are used in sequence.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
