The unexpected SQL queries indicate a potential bug in how these methods interact or how the SQL query is being constructed based on the method calls. The relevant files identified from the context suggest focusing on 'django/db/models/query.py', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', and potentially 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' where the methods for field selection and SQL query generation are implemented. To address the issue, we should specifically search for the implementations of the 'defer', 'only', and related internal methods that manipulate the field selection and SQL query building in these files. Also, checking if any related tests in 'django/test' might help understand the expected behavior and edge cases.",

Specifically, the issue is that .defer() does not clear previously deferred fields when .only() is used, leading to all fields being loaded unexpectedly. To address this, we need to focus on the methods that handle the immediate and deferred loading of fields, particularly the Query.add_deferred_loading() and Query.add_immediate_loading() methods, and the QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only() methods. These methods have been identified in the search results as part of the django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py files.\n\nBy analyzing these methods, we can see how deferred and immediate loading are being handled. The Query.add_deferred_loading() method processes the names of fields to defer, and the Query.add_immediate_loading() method handles the immediate loading of specified fields. These methods work with the Query.deferred_loading attribute, which keeps track of which fields should be loaded immediately and which should be deferred. The QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only() methods are responsible for setting up the deferred and immediate loading instructions on a QuerySet instance. These methods interact with the underlying Query instance to modify the deferred_loading attribute accordingly.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to examine how these methods handle the interaction between .only() and .defer(). Currently, it seems that the deferred_loading attribute is not being appropriately updated when .defer() is used after .only(), leading to the scenario where all fields are being loaded unexpectedly. The solution might involve adjusting the logic in these methods to ensure that the deferred_loading attribute is correctly updated when there is a mix of .only() and .defer() calls.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
