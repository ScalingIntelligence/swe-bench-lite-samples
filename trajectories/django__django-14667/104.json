The issue involves how deferred fields are managed when only() is subsequently called, leading to unexpected SQL queries selecting more fields than intended. The analysis should encompass the handling of deferred fields in both QuerySet and Query classes, specifically looking at the add_deferred_loading(), add_immediate_loading(), and deferred_to_data() methods. These methods define how fields are marked for deferred or immediate loading, which directly affects the SQL query construction. The search results include relevant code spans defining these methods, which are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue. This review will help in identifying if the current logic aligns with the expected behavior and whether adjustments are necessary to ensure that chaining defer() after only() behaves as expected, excluding unnecessary fields from the final SQL query.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
