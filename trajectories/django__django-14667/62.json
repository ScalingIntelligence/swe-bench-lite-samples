The expected SQL generated by these methods does not match the actual SQL output. This discrepancy suggests a problem in how Django's `QuerySet` manages deferred and immediate loading of fields. Given the complexity of this issue, it's crucial to investigate the logic in both the `QuerySet` class and the underlying SQL query construction to understand how `defer()` and `only()` methods interact with field loading strategies. Specifically, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is responsible for building SQL queries, and understanding its handling of deferred loading (`add_deferred_loading`, `clear_deferred_loading`) and immediate loading (`add_immediate_loading`) will be key to finding a solution. The `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` also plays a role in the final SQL compilation step.",

The issue arises when the generated SQL query selects more fields than expected when `.defer()` follows `.only()`. The relevant code spans appear to be located in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. Specifically, the methods `defer()` and `only()` in the QuerySet class, and the methods `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()` in the Query class are directly related to the handling of deferred and immediate field loading. These methods manage the `deferred_loading` attribute of the Query object, which controls which fields are deferred or immediately loaded. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data()` method in the Query class processes the deferred loading settings to determine which fields are actually loaded. Given these methods and their interactions, it seems plausible that the issue could be addressed by modifying how the `deferred_loading` attribute is updated and interpreted during these method calls.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
