            "scratch_pad": "In order to address the reported issue regarding the unexpected field selections when using `defer()` and `only()` methods together in Django's QuerySet, it's crucial to analyze the behavior of these methods within the QuerySet class. The search results provide detailed insights into the implementation of these methods, including how they modify the query and handle deferred and immediate loading of fields. The focus should be on identifying the logic that determines which fields are included in the final SQL query after chaining `defer()` and `only()` methods. Specifically, looking at the `defer` and `only` methods in the QuerySet class, we can see how they manipulate the query's loading strategy. The `defer` method adds fields to the deferred loading list, while the `only` method limits the loading to specified fields, adding them to the immediate loading list. The challenge arises when these methods are chained in a manner that might lead to undesired inclusion of all fields. The analysis so far suggests that the logic for deciding which fields to include or exclude might not correctly handle the combination of deferred and only fields, leading to the observed behavior. This understanding is based on the provided code spans, particularly the sections defining and interacting with deferred and immediate loading lists. The methods `QuerySet.defer` and `QuerySet.only` are key to understanding and addressing this issue. By examining and possibly modifying the logic in these methods, one can ensure that the SQL query generated correctly adheres to the intended field exclusions and inclusions defined by `defer()` and `only()`.",
