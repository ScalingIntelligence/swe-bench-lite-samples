Specifically, when chaining `defer()` after `only()`, the SQL query generated is not as expected. This discrepancy suggests that the logic handling deferred and immediate loading of fields might not be correctly updating the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class.\n\nAnalyzing the current file context, we see the `QuerySet` class with methods `defer()` and `only()`. These methods interact with the `Query` class's `deferred_loading` attribute, but there doesn't seem to be a mechanism to handle the interaction between `defer()` and `only()` properly.\n\nIn the new search results, the `Query` class includes methods `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`. These methods directly manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute, which consists of a tuple where the first element is a set of field names and the second element indicates whether to defer loading.\n\nGiven the issue, it seems critical to ensure that after calling `only()`, subsequent calls to `defer()` should adjust the `deferred_loading` attribute appropriately. The current implementation might not properly handle the sequence of these operations, leading to the observed behavior.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Query` class's methods need to properly handle the transitioning between deferred and immediate loading based on the sequence of `defer()` and `only()` calls. Additionally, it might be necessary to introduce new logic or adjust existing logic in the `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` methods to ensure correct behavior.\n\nRelevant code spans from the new search results include the entire span for the `Query` class as it encapsulates the logic for deferred and immediate loading, which is central to the issue.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
