The issue describes how unexpected fields are selected in the generated SQL query, specifically when using the `.defer()` method after `.only()`. This scenario is not producing the expected SQL query, which should only select certain fields. \n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans include:\n- `QuerySet` class methods: `def __init__(self, ...)`, `def defer(self, *fields)`, and `def only(self, *fields)` in `django/db/models/query.py`. These methods define the behavior of `defer` and `only` for the `QuerySet` class, which aligns with the issue description.\n- `Query` class methods: `def __init__(self, ...)`, `def deferred_to_data(self, ...)`, `def add_deferred_loading(self, field_names)`, and `def add_immediate_loading(self, field_names)` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These methods handle the deferred loading logic and immediate loading of fields, which could be relevant for identifying and fixing the issue encountered.\n\nBased on the analysis, the provided code spans encapsulate the functionalities within the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes that directly address the reported issue. The `deferred_to_data`, `add_deferred_loading`, and `add_immediate_loading` methods in the `Query` class are particularly relevant for managing the field loading logic, which seems to be where the problem lies. Therefore, these code spans are the most relevant to further investigate and modify to resolve the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
