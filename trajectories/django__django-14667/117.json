The problem is that chaining .defer() after .only() does not clear the deferred fields as expected, leading to the loading of all fields instead of the intended ones. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the deferred and immediate loading of fields in the QuerySet class and the underlying Query class. The code spans provided include the definitions of the defer() and only() methods in QuerySet, as well as the add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() methods in the Query class. These methods are responsible for manipulating the deferred_loading attribute, which determines which fields are loaded immediately and which are deferred. The analysis reveals that the logic for handling deferred and immediate loading seems to be correctly implemented, but there might be an issue in how these methods are being combined or how the deferred_loading attribute is being processed. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem, but the provided code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

The issue suggests that certain combinations of defer() and only() calls lead to the loading of unexpected fields. To address this, we need to look at how Django handles these methods internally, particularly in the Query class where the deferred_loading attribute is managed. The code spans in the file_context already provide insight into how defer() and only() manipulate the deferred_loading attribute. The new search results in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py offer additional context on how SQL compilation integrates with these deferred fields, specifically in the SQLCompiler class's get_default_columns method, which builds the SQL's SELECT clause based on the deferred_loading attribute. This integration is crucial for understanding how deferred fields affect the final SQL query. Therefore, the relevant code spans for the issue are the QuerySet's .only() and .defer() methods and the SQLCompiler's get_default_columns method, as they deal directly with the deferred fields and the final query construction.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
