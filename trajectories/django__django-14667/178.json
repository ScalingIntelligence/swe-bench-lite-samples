The issue specifically mentions that when using defer() after only(), the expected SQL query doesn't match the actual output. The provided search results contain the definitions of the defer() and only() methods in the QuerySet class from Django's db/models/query.py file. Both methods seem to manipulate the query's deferred and immediate loading lists, respectively. However, the issue suggests that chaining these methods doesn't produce the expected outcome. The relevant code spans are those where these methods are defined, as they directly relate to the issue's description. Additionally, it's crucial to note that while these methods operate directly on the query's state, the actual logic for SQL generation happens elsewhere, but for the purpose of identifying the code relevant to the reported issue, these method definitions are the key focus. Therefore, I'll mark the spans defining only() and defer() as relevant.",
