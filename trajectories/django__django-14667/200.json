            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the behavior of the `QuerySet.defer()` method when chained with `only()` in Django's ORM. Specifically, the issue is that chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not produce the expected SQL queries, which should select only the specified fields. Instead, in some cases, all fields are being selected. This suggests that the `defer()` method is not properly handling the state set by `only()`. To address this, it's important to look at how `defer()` and `only()` are implemented and how they interact with the query generation process. The provided code spans include the `QuerySet.defer()` method, which delegates the handling of deferred fields to the `Query.add_deferred_loading()` method. Additionally, the `Query.clear_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` methods are relevant as they manage the state of deferred fields. The `Query.deferred_to_data()` method is also important as it helps in understanding how deferred fields are processed. The `Query.set_values()` method, which is used to set the fields for value-based queries, is also relevant, as well as the helper function `add_to_dict()` which is used in processing deferred fields. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how deferred loading is managed in Django ORM, making them relevant to the reported issue. Therefore, I am identifying these spans as relevant to the issue, considering both their functionality and how they contribute to handling the state of deferred fields in the ORM.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
