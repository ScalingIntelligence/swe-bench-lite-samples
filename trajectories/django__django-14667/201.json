The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the primary functions of interest are `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`. These functions are crucial for managing which fields are deferred or loaded immediately in a queryset.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
