Specifically, it notes that when defer() follows only(), the generated SQL query selects unexpected fields. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the logic for defer() and only() within the QuerySet class and the Query class. The search results provide several key code spans that are relevant to this issue. These include the QuerySet.defer, QuerySet.only, Query.add_deferred_loading, and Query.add_immediate_loading methods. Additionally, the Query.deferred_to_data method, which is used to process deferred loading, is crucial for understanding how deferred fields are managed in Django's SQL queries. Furthermore, the SQLCompiler.get_default_columns and SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns methods are relevant as they help in determining which columns to include in the SQL query based on deferred loading settings. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how deferred and immediate loading are handled within Django, which should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue with chaining defer() and only().",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
