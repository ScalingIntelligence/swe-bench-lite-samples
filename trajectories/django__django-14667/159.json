The described behavior involves unexpected SQL queries that load fields which should have been excluded. This suggests issues in how field exclusion and inclusion are handled within these methods. Since the files provided contain definitions for QuerySet, Query, SQLCompiler, and Deferred, it's likely that the logic for handling deferred and only fields resides in these files. I will specifically look for implementations of `defer()` and `only()` in the QuerySet class and related methods in Query and SQLCompiler to pinpoint the exact code causing this issue.",

The issue suggests that the deferred fields are not being correctly excluded when chaining `defer()` after `only()`. This requires a detailed examination of how the deferred loading mechanism is implemented and how field names are managed within `QuerySet` and `Query`. The provided code spans include the initialization of `QuerySet` and `Query`, as well as the methods for managing deferred loading (`defer()`, `only()`, `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`) within `QuerySet` and `Query`. These are the primary areas to focus on since they directly influence the selection of fields in SQL queries. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data()` method in `Query` shows how deferred loading is handled, indicating how fields are treated when they are deferred or immediately loaded. Overall, these spans cover the essential logic for managing field loading in query construction, which is critical for addressing the reported issue.",

The issue specifically points out that chaining `.defer()` after `.only()` does not produce the expected SQL query, which should only select the primary key 'id' but instead selects all fields. This suggests that the methods are not correctly updating the deferred loading state within the `Query` class. We will examine the methods `defer()`, `only()`, and their interaction with `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` within the `Query` class. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data()` method in the `Query` class is responsible for managing deferred fields, and it should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.",

The provided file context includes several key methods from `query.py` and `query.py`: `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`. These methods deal with managing deferred and immediate field loading. The search results provided related code in `compiler.py`, including methods such as `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` and `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()`, which are critical for understanding how field loading is determined in SQL compilation.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, it is evident that the methods `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` directly manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute of the Query object. However, there doesn't seem to be specific handling to clear deferred fields when `only()` is called after `defer()`, which could explain the observed behavior. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` method uses the results of `deferred_to_columns()` to decide which columns to include in the SQL query, which indirectly relates to the issue at hand by determining which fields are loaded.\n\nThe search task is complete as the identified code spans directly address the issue of managing field deferral and immediate loading in QuerySets, and how these are translated into SQL queries.",
