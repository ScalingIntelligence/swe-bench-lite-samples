The user expects that chaining these methods would result in a SQL query that only selects certain fields, but the actual behavior is different. The provided search results contain the implementation of the `only()` method in the `QuerySet` class. This method is responsible for specifying which fields should be loaded immediately. The `only()` method sets up immediate loading of specified fields, but it doesn't handle the chaining with `defer()` correctly, leading to unexpected field selections in the SQL query. To address the issue, the implementation of the `defer()` method should also be reviewed and potentially updated to handle the logic correctly when both methods are chained. This will involve understanding how the `QuerySet` class manages field selections and updating the internal state so that subsequent method calls correctly adjust the field selections.",

To address this, I need to analyze the methods related to field selection and deferring in the QuerySet class. I have found the `QuerySet.only` and `QuerySet.defer` methods in the search results. Examining both methods reveals how fields are being handled in the queryset. The `QuerySet.only` method adds immediate loading fields, but when defer is called on these, it seems to not clear the field list as expected. To resolve the issue, it might be necessary to look into the add_deferred_loading and clear_deferred_loading methods in the query class used by `QuerySet.defer`. This analysis suggests that the `QuerySet.defer` method could be the place where the bug lies. Identifying the relevant span ID for the `QuerySet.defer` method is crucial for further examination and potential fixing of the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
