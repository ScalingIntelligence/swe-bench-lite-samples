Specifically, the issue suggests that chaining `.defer()` after `.only()` does not produce the expected SQL query, which should only select the non-deferred fields. To address this, it is necessary to analyze the implementation of these methods in the Django source code.\n\nThe search results provided include several relevant code spans from the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files. These spans encapsulate the `QuerySet` class methods `defer()` and `only()`, as well as the `Query` class methods `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`. These methods are directly responsible for managing the deferred and immediate loading of model fields, which are central to the issue at hand.\n\nConsidering the provided code spans, it appears that the logic for handling deferred fields and immediate loading fields could be the root cause of the reported issue. The methods `defer()` and `only()` manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute of the `Query` class, which seems to be the key element for determining which fields are deferred and which are loaded immediately. The `deferred_loading` attribute is a tuple where the first element is a set of field names, and the second element is a boolean indicating whether the fields are deferred.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans appear to correctly target the sections of the codebase where the issue could be occurring. Therefore, the identified spans are likely relevant to the reported issue, and the search task can be considered complete with these findings.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
