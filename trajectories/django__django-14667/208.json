The `defer()` method adds fields to a set of deferred fields, while the `only()` method primarily focuses on immediate loading of specified fields. It appears that both methods interact with `self.deferred_loading`, a tuple consisting of a set of field names and a boolean indicating whether the fields are deferred. The interaction between these methods merits further investigation, specifically to ensure that the SQL query generation process respects these deferred fields as expected when chaining method calls. Additionally, any related classes or middleware that might influence the SQL query post-processing should be considered, particularly those within the `django/db/models/sql/` directory.",

The problem arises when chaining these methods, leading to unexpected SQL queries that select more fields than intended. The key elements in the reported issue are the 'Company' model and the specific method chaining of .defer() and .only() that result in unexpected SQL output. The provided search results include relevant code spans from the 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' files. These files contain the implementation of the QuerySet class and the Query class, which are central to how Django handles database queries. Specifically, within the Query class, the methods add_deferred_loading and add_immediate_loading handle the logic of deferred and immediate field loading. Additionally, the deferred_to_data method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' seems crucial for how deferred fields are processed. While the provided search results do not directly address the issue of clearing deferred fields when chaining .defer() with .only(), they provide a foundational understanding of how field loading is managed in Django's ORM. Further analysis is warranted to identify if the logic around updating deferred_loading in add_deferred_loading and add_immediate_loading correctly handles the scenario described in the reported issue, particularly when chaining .only() with .defer(). This will require a deeper dive into how these methods update the 'deferred_loading' attribute, which controls the deferred or immediate loading of fields in the database queries.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about how QuerySet methods `.only()` and `.defer()` interact when chained together. Specifically, the issue is that when `.defer()` is called after `.only()`, it doesn't seem to clear the deferred fields as expected, resulting in an SQL query that selects unexpected fields. From the provided code, it's evident that the methods `.defer()` and `.only()` in the `QuerySet` class are responsible for controlling which fields to load from the database, with `.defer()` delaying the loading of certain fields and `.only()` specifying which fields to load immediately. Understanding how these methods interact with the `Query` class, which holds the state of the query, is crucial for addressing this issue. The `Query` class methods, such as `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`, manage the deferred loading state, setting which fields should be deferred and which should be loaded immediately. Analyzing the methods mentioned, particularly their interactions and how they update the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class, is necessary to diagnose and potentially fix the problem. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data()` method in the `Query` class also plays a role in managing deferred fields by converting deferred field specifications into a form that can be used by the database. The `SQLCompiler` class and its methods are also relevant as they are responsible for compiling the query into SQL, including handling deferred fields. Reviewing these methods suggests that the issue may lie in the logic of how deferred fields are handled when both `.only()` and `.defer()` are called in sequence, as well as how the deferred fields are translated into SQL select statements. Further analysis, possibly involving debugging and modification of these methods, is needed to ensure that the deferred fields logic works as expected when these methods are chained.",
