The provided context suggests that the methods `defer` and `only` in the `QuerySet` class might be the starting point for the investigation. Additionally, the SQL generation process within the `SQLCompiler` class could also be relevant, as it is responsible for translating QuerySets into SQL queries. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is another critical component as it manages the internal state of the query, including deferred and immediate loading fields.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the behavior of the `QuerySet.defer()` method when used in conjunction with `QuerySet.only()` in Django. The specific problem is that when `.defer()` is chained after `.only()`, it does not produce the expected SQL query, instead loading all fields. This suggests a potential issue with how the `defer` and `only` methods handle the deferred loading or immediate loading logic.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/query.py`, specifically in the `QuerySet` class. The methods identified as relevant are `defer()`, `only()`, and `_chain()`. These methods are directly involved in setting up deferred loading and immediate loading for fields in a queryset. As `_chain()` is used to create cloned instances of the queryset, it is also relevant because it affects how these settings are propagated.\n\nAdditional context is found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` within the `Query` class. The methods `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, `add_immediate_loading()`, and `get_loaded_field_names()` are relevant for managing the deferred loading logic at a lower level of the Django ORM. This confirms that the issue extends beyond the `QuerySet` level and into the `Query` execution level.\n\nThere is no direct reference to SQLCompiler in the identified spans, so further analysis of SQL generation or compilation at this stage is not necessary. However, the identified sections in `QuerySet` and `Query` should be sufficient to address the issue by altering how deferred fields are handled when `only()` and `defer()` are chained together.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
