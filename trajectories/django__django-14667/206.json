The provided search results contain relevant code spans in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py. The QuerySet class has methods defer() and only() which handle deferred and immediate loading of fields respectively. Additionally, the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py has methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() which manipulate the deferred_loading attribute to control field loading behavior. These methods appear to be the critical parts of the codebase that pertain to the issue at hand. The issue likely arises due to how the interaction between these methods is handled when chaining, specifically how the deferred_loading attribute is updated and interpreted by the SQLCompiler.

The provided search results contain the relevant code spans that address this issue:\n\n1. The `QuerySet.defer` and `QuerySet.only` methods in `django/db/models/query.py` are responsible for handling deferred and immediate field loading respectively. These methods call `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` on the `query` object.\n\n2. The `Query.add_deferred_loading` and `Query.add_immediate_loading` methods in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` manage the deferred loading of fields. These methods manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute to control which fields are deferred or immediately loaded.\n\nFrom the issue description and the provided code spans, it is clear that the problematic behavior occurs when `defer()` is called after `only()`, which suggests an issue with how the deferred loading logic is handled in these methods. The identified code spans provide a clear starting point for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans have been successfully identified, aligning with the reported issue.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
