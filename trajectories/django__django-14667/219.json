Additionally, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` should be investigated for how it handles deferred and immediate loading of fields.

Specifically, it mentions that when chaining `.defer()` after `.only()`, unexpected fields are selected in the SQL query, which is not the expected behavior. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in the `QuerySet` class within `django/db/models/query.py` and the `Query` class within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These code spans include the definitions and implementations of the `defer()` and `only()` methods, as well as the helper methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` which manage the deferred loading of fields. The analysis of these code spans shows that they directly relate to the issue at hand, as they handle the logic for which fields are deferred or immediately loaded by the QuerySet. Understanding these methods and their interaction is crucial for addressing the reported issue. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` includes a method `deferred_to_columns()` which might be relevant for how deferred fields are ultimately handled in SQL generation, though the immediate relevance to the issue might be indirect.",

The issue describes that when chaining .defer() after .only(), the expected SQL query that should select only specific fields does not occur, instead, all fields are selected. \n\nReviewing the provided code spans, we can see the implementation of the defer() and only() methods in django/db/models/query.py and their corresponding operations on the Query object in django/db/models/sql/query.py: \n\n1. In QuerySet.defer(), the method calls `clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields)` to mark fields for deferred loading. \n2. In QuerySet.only(), the method calls `clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)` to mark fields for immediate loading. \n3. In the Query class, methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() manipulate the deferred_loading attribute which determines which fields are deferred or immediately loaded. \n\nHowever, there seems to be an underlying issue in how these methods interact with each other or how the deferred_loading logic is applied. The initialization and manipulation of deferred_loading, especially in the add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() methods, should be closely examined to ensure they correctly handle the transition between deferred and immediate loading, especially when chaining .defer() after .only().\n\nBased on the issue description and the current code context, the relevant spans from the search results are those that deal directly with how deferred and immediate loading fields are handled. These sections of code need further review and possibly modification to address the issue described.",

The relevant code in the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes indicates that `defer()` and `only()` methods indeed do not interact in a way that ensures deferred fields are properly cleared. Specifically, `add_immediate_loading()` in the `Query` class sets fields for immediate loading without checking or resetting the deferred fields first. This confirms the issue's description. However, there is no explicit reset or checking mechanism in the `only()` method to handle previously set deferred fields, which would be necessary to address the reported issue. The current implementation allows contradictory states, as `defer()` can set fields to be deferred, and `only()` might not reset these deferred settings when it is called afterward, leading to unexpected SQL queries.",
