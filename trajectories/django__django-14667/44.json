Specifically, when chaining .defer() after .only(), all fields are unexpectedly loaded rather than the expected field subset. This suggests a potential issue in how the .defer() and .only() methods handle field selection and deferred loading. The relevant methods from the QuerySet class are .defer(), and .only(). These methods are responsible for manipulating the fields that are deferred or immediately loaded in the QuerySet. They both call self._chain() for cloning the QuerySet, and they use self.query's methods for adding deferred loading and immediate loading. Therefore, these methods, especially their interplay on self.query, should be investigated for the cause of the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
