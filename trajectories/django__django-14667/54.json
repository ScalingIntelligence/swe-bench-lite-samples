This issue specifically points out that when `defer()` follows `only()`, it does not clear the deferred field as expected and instead results in loading all fields. To address this, we need to find the code that handles the logic for `defer()` and `only()`. The provided search results contain the implementation of these methods in the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class in Django's `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files, respectively.\n\nFirst, in `django/db/models/query.py`, we have the `QuerySet` class definition with the `defer()` and `only()` methods. The `defer()` method calls `add_deferred_loading()` on the query, while the `only()` method calls `add_immediate_loading()`. These methods are responsible for adding fields to the deferred or immediate loading sets.\n\nNext, in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `Query` class contains the `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` methods. These methods manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute, which holds the sets of fields to be deferred or immediately loaded. The `add_deferred_loading()` method adds fields to the deferred set if `defer` is True and removes them if `defer` is False. The `add_immediate_loading()` method does the opposite.\n\nTo fix the chaining issue, we need to examine how these methods interact, particularly when `defer()` follows `only()`. The current implementation may not be correctly adjusting the deferred and immediate loading sets when fields are both added and then deferred. It is crucial to ensure that the `deferred_loading` attribute is correctly managed in all scenarios, including when methods are chained.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly address the functionality of `defer()` and `only()` methods in the context of deferred and immediate loading.",

I analyzed the `Query` class which handles deferred loading through `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading`. These methods determine which fields are deferred or immediately loaded. The relevant spans I identified were confined to the `Query` class, particularly the `deferred_loading` attribute and the methods that manipulate `deferred_loading`.

Given that searching for test files is not possible, our focus should remain on the primary source code files related to the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes. We need to delve deeper into how the `deferred_loading` settings impact the field selections in the SQL `SELECT` clause. This involves understanding how the actual SQL query is constructed based on these settings and identifying any potential discrepancies between the intended logic and the actual behavior when `defer()` and `only()` are chained.",

The focus is on how the SQL query generation is affected when .defer() is called after .only(). The issue describes that the SQL query does not select the expected fields when .defer() is chained with .only(), which leads to the selection of all fields rather than the expected subset.\n\nThe relevant code spans in the search results pertain to the methods `QuerySet.defer` and `QuerySet.only` in the `QuerySet` class, and the `Query.add_deferred_loading` and `Query.add_immediate_loading` methods in the `Query` class. These methods are responsible for managing the deferred and immediate loading of fields when constructing SQL queries.\n\nGiven the inputs, we need to ensure that the methods correctly handle the transition between deferred and immediate loading when chaining .defer() and .only(). The current context already includes the `QuerySet.defer` and `QuerySet.only` methods, which are essential for understanding how the method chaining behaves. The new search results provide additional context with the `Query.add_deferred_loading` and `Query.add_immediate_loading` methods, which are responsible for managing the deferred loading state. These methods update the `self.deferred_loading` attribute, which determines which fields are deferred and which are immediately loaded.\n\nThe analysis of these methods indicates that the logic for handling the deferred loading state might need adjustment to ensure correct behavior when chaining .defer() and .only(). Specifically, the methods currently use a tuple `(existing, defer)` to manage the deferred loading state, where `existing` is a set of field names and `defer` is a Boolean indicating whether the state is deferred or immediate. The logic in `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` should be reviewed to ensure that the state transitions between deferred and immediate loading are correctly managed when methods are chained. This includes ensuring that previously deferred fields are correctly handled when switching to immediate loading and vice versa.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans provide the necessary context to address the reported issue by ensuring that the deferred loading state is correctly managed when chaining .defer() and .only(). However, more work might be required to implement the necessary changes, such as reviewing the logic for managing the deferred loading state and possibly updating it to ensure the correct behavior when chaining methods.",
