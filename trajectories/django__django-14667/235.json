To address this, it is crucial to identify the relevant parts of the code where these methods (`defer()` and `only()`) are implemented and where the logic determines the fields to be loaded. The search results provide the core implementation of these methods within the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class in 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', respectively. These segments include the methods `defer()`, `only()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`, all of which play a critical role in managing the deferred loading of fields. By examining these methods, we can understand how the process of adding fields to deferred or immediate loading works and identify any discrepancies or missing logic that might be causing the issue described in the report.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
