The problem is that unexpected fields are being selected in the SQL query, even when using `defer()` to exclude fields that were included by `only()`. To resolve this, we need to investigate the implementation of these methods in the `QuerySet` class and related classes like `Query` and `SQLCompiler`. Additionally, we should look into how deferred fields are managed in the ORM to ensure proper handling of field exclusions and inclusions.",

When a .defer() follows an .only(), the expected SQL query does not select the expected fields. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the QuerySet class and the Query class are involved, particularly the 'QuerySet.defer', 'QuerySet.only', 'Query.add_deferred_loading', 'Query.add_immediate_loading' methods. These methods handle the logic for deferred and immediate loading of fields in a QuerySet. To address the issue, it is crucial to ensure that chaining .defer() after .only() clears any immediate loading properly or vice versa. The 'Query.deferred_to_data' method is also identified as potentially relevant for understanding how deferred fields are processed. The 'SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns' method may be involved in the final SQL generation, affecting the actual query results. The identified code does not explicitly show how the chaining of .defer() and .only() is currently handled, nor does it show how these methods update the state that affects SQL query generation. Further investigation into how these methods interact and affect the 'deferred_loading' attribute might be necessary to fully understand and resolve the reported issue.",

The provided search results include code spans that directly relate to the implementation of the `QuerySet` class, specifically focusing on the `defer()` and `only()` methods, as well as related functionalities. These spans are crucial for understanding and possibly addressing the reported issue. The analysis of these code spans shows how the deferred loading of fields is managed in the `Query` class. This includes methods like `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading`, which handle the addition of fields to be deferred or immediately loaded, respectively. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data` method is involved in converting deferred loading specifications into actionable data objects. These methods are central to the functionality described in the issue, making them highly relevant for identifying the cause and potential solution to the problem. Furthermore, the `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns` method also plays a role in managing deferred loading at the SQL compilation level, adding to the set of relevant code spans. Overall, these spans cover the key areas necessary for resolving the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
