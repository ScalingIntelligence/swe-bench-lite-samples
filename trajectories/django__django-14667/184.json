The root cause seems to be in how these methods are implemented and how they interact with the SQL generation process. By checking the implementation of these methods and how they set or clear deferred and immediate loading of fields, we can pinpoint why the SQL query does not match the expected behavior. Specifically, we need to investigate the QuerySet class for the `defer` and `only` methods, the Query class for SQL generation, and possibly the SQLCompiler class for the actual SQL construction.",

The issue describes how chaining `.defer()` after `.only()` results in unexpected SQL queries that load all fields instead of only the expected fields. The issue provides specific examples of these unexpected behaviors and contrasts them with the expected behavior. \n\nUpon analyzing the search results, several key methods are found within the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes that are likely relevant to this issue:\n\n- `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()`: These methods directly relate to the operations described in the issue and are the focus of the problem. They are responsible for setting deferred and immediate loading fields, respectively.\n- `Query.clear_deferred_loading()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`: These methods manage which fields are deferred and which are loaded immediately, suggesting they could be part of the internal mechanism that goes awry when chaining `.defer()` and `.only()`.\n\nThese methods are found in the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files, which align with Django's ORM implementation. The `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods interact with the `Query` class to manage the SQL generation, indicating that the code spans provided are likely where the bug resides or where a fix would need to be applied to resolve the issue.\n\nGiven the alignment of the issue's description with the functionality of these methods and their management of field loading, it's reasonable to assume that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

Specifically, the issue is that chaining `.defer()` after `.only()` does not exclude the deferred fields from the query, contrary to expectations.\n\nThe provided context and search results include relevant methods from `QuerySet`, such as `defer()` and `only()`, which manipulate the query's deferred loading behavior. The `Query` class methods `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()` also play a crucial role in managing deferred fields and immediate loading fields.\n\nIn the search results, the `SQLCompiler` class is responsible for compiling the SQL query from the query's internal representation. The methods `get_select()`, `get_group_by()`, `get_order_by()`, `get_extra_select()`, and `get_default_columns()` are relevant as they determine which columns to include in the final SQL query. These methods use the information about deferred and immediate loading fields to construct the query.\n\nGiven this understanding, the identified spans in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` related to how columns are selected, grouped, and ordered are relevant to the reported issue. These spans help in understanding how the SQL query is constructed based on the deferred and immediate loading fields.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
