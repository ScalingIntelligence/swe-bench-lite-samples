Specifically, the issue points out that chaining defer() after only() does not clear the deferred fields as expected. The expected behavior is not observed in the generated SQL queries, which select more fields than intended.\n\nFrom the provided search results, we find the relevant code spans that directly relate to these methods in the Django codebase. Both QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only() methods are defined in django/db/models/query.py. These methods operate on the Query class, which holds the logic for deferred and immediate loading of fields.\n\nThe analysis of the code reveals how defer() and only() methods interact with the Query object to control field loading. The Query class, located in django/db/models/sql/query.py, contains the core logic for managing deferred loading and immediate loading. Methods add_deferred_loading and add_immediate_loading are critical for understanding how fields are flagged for deferred or immediate loading. It's clear from the provided code that these methods manipulate the deferred_loading attribute of the Query class, which is a tuple that tracks which fields are to be deferred or loaded immediately.\n\nGiven the context of the issue and the provided code, it's evident that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue. However, further analysis might be needed to fully diagnose and address the issue if it's a bug or a misunderstanding of the behavior.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
