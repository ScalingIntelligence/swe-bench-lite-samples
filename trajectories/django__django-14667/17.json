It is stated that the SQL query generated selects fields that were not expected to be loaded, especially when `defer()` follows `only()`. The provided search results contain the definition of `QuerySet` class with the methods `defer()` and `only()`. Both methods are used to manipulate the fields that get loaded from the database. The `defer()` method adds fields to a list of deferred fields, meaning those fields will not be loaded. On the other hand, the `only()` method specifies the exact fields to be loaded. The issue seems to be related to the internal state of the QuerySet and how the chaining of these methods is handled. Specifically, the problem may lie in how the deferred and immediate loading lists are managed when these methods are called in sequence. Analyzing the provided code spans, especially `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()`, shows that they manipulate the query's deferred and immediate loading lists, but there doesn't appear to be any specific handling for the case where `defer()` follows `only()`. This absence may explain why the behavior is not as expected. Identifying these methods as highly relevant is crucial as they directly relate to the reported issue concerning the unexpected SQL query results.",

The problem appears to be that when `.defer()` is called following `.only()`, the deferred fields are not excluded from the SQL query as expected. The provided code spans from `django/db/models/query.py` reveal the implementations of `defer()` and `only()` methods within the `QuerySet` class, which manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute of the `Query` object. In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, there are methods that handle the deferred loading logic such as `add_deferred_loading()`, `add_immediate_loading()`, and `clear_deferred_loading()`. These methods manage the `deferred_loading` tuple by adding or clearing fields that should either be deferred or immediately loaded. The issue likely stems from the interaction between these methods when `defer()` follows `only()`. In the context provided, the relevant code spans (identified by their span IDs) are those directly involved in managing deferred fields and generating SQL queries. The `QuerySet.only()`, `QuerySet.defer()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` methods are essential for understanding and potentially fixing the reported issue.",

The `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods modify this list based on whether the current state is deferring fields or loading them immediately.

The report indicates that chaining .only() and .defer() does not yield expected SQL queries, suggesting a potential issue in how field loading states are managed.\n\nGiven the context and search results, the relevant spans to look at are those that deal with deferred and immediate field loading in the Query object. This includes Query.add_deferred_loading, Query.add_immediate_loading, and Query.clear_deferred_loading. These methods are responsible for adjusting the set of deferred and immediately loaded fields.\n\nThe search results provide a comprehensive set of methods within the Query class, which manage the deferred_loading attribute. This attribute is crucial as it determines which fields are deferred and which are loaded immediately. The analysis of these methods shows that they handle the deferred load state by either adding or removing fields from the deferred_loading set, or by clearing it entirely.\n\nMoreover, the Query.deferred_to_data method is identified as part of the mechanism to map deferred fields to their corresponding data handling. This method could potentially be part of the larger logic that governs how field loading indications are utilized during query execution.\n\nBased on the detailed examination, it appears that the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue. They cover the core functionalities related to managing and applying field loading conditions in Django's ORM queries.",

The `defer()` method adds fields to the deferred loading list, while the `only()` method adds fields to the immediate loading list.
