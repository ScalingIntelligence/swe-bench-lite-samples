Specifically, the SQL query generated selects all fields instead of the expected subset. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle these methods. The provided search results include several key sections, notably the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py, which defines the .defer() method, and the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which handles deferred loading management. Additionally, the SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py is crucial as it likely compiles SQL queries based on deferred and only settings.\n\nBeyond this, we should investigate how the deferred_loading attribute in the Query class, managed via add_deferred_loading and clear_deferred_loading methods, interacts with QuerySet methods. This could potentially show where the issue arises, as the current logic might not correctly handle the combination of such methods.\n\nUnderstanding when and how deferred_loading is set, cleared, and altered could help pinpoint the code block responsible for generating the SQL. Detecting inconsistencies or missing logical checks in these methods might lead to identifying the issue. Observing the QuerySet's interaction with Query to see if there are any gaps or incorrect assumptions could also prove useful for resolving the reported behavior.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
