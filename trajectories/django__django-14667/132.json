The issue describes unexpected SQL query field selections when using these methods in certain sequences. Upon analyzing the provided code, it's evident that the methods `defer` and `only` in `QuerySet` manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class, which controls which fields are deferred or immediately loaded. However, the logic for handling the combination of deferred and immediate loading might not properly handle the chaining of these methods, leading to the reported discrepancies. Specifically, these methods add or remove fields from the `deferred_loading` tuple but might not correctly reset or compute the set based on the sequential application of `only` and `defer`. This could be the root cause of the issue, where the SQL query ends up selecting unexpected fields.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
