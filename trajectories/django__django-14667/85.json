Specifically, it notes that chaining `defer()` after `only()` results in all fields being loaded, which is not the expected behavior. The expected behavior would be for the query to only select the fields that are not deferred. To address this, it is necessary to analyze the implementations of these methods in the context of the QuerySet class.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant sections to examine are:\n- QuerySet's `defer()` method, which is responsible for adding fields to the deferred loading list.\n- QuerySet's `only()` method, which is responsible for adding fields to the immediate loading list.\n\nBoth methods manipulate the `query` object of the QuerySet instance, indicating that the resolution of this issue likely involves adjusting how these methods interact with the underlying query object. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class has a method `deferred_to_columns()` that might be related to how the deferred fields are handled during SQL query compilation.\n\nBased on the analysis of these methods and the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those that involve the manipulation of deferred and immediate loading lists within the QuerySet class.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
