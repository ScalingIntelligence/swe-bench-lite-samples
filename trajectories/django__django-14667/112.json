            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the unexpected behavior when chaining `.defer()` and `.only()` methods in Django's `QuerySet`. Specifically, the issue is that calling `.defer()` after `.only()` does not clear the deferred fields as expected, leading to the SQL query selecting more fields than intended. The analysis of the search results reveals that the relevant code spans are located in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The `QuerySet` class in `query.py` contains the implementations of the `defer()` and `only()` methods, which are directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `Query` class in `query.py` contains methods that manage deferred loading such as `clear_deferred_loading()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()`, which interact with the deferred fields. These methods are crucial for handling the deferred and immediate loading of fields as described in the issue. The identified code spans cover the essential parts of the codebase that deal with the deferred loading logic, which is central to resolving the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of Django's QuerySet methods `defer()` and `only()` when chaining them. Specifically, the issue notes that when `defer()` is called after `only()`, it doesn't clear the deferred field as expected, leading to the selection of all fields in the SQL query. This behavior can be observed in the following examples:\n\n- `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")`\n- `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")`\n\nIn both cases, the SQL query selects all fields instead of only the expected ones. The expected behavior would be to select only the 'id' field.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, the relevant code spans can be identified in the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes. Specifically:\n\n1. `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods, found in `django/db/models/query.py`.\n2. `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` methods, found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.\n\nThese methods handle the logic for deferred and immediate loading of fields. The issue might stem from the interaction between these methods when they are chained, particularly in how the `deferred_loading` attribute is managed.\n\nAdditional context is also provided in the `SQLCompiler` class within `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which is responsible for compiling SQL queries. Specifically, the methods `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()` might also be relevant as they deal with column selection based on deferred loading.\n\nBy focusing on these methods, we can further investigate the exact cause of the issue and identify potential fixes or improvements to ensure that chaining `defer()` and `only()` works as expected.",

The `defer()` method either adds fields to an existing set or subtracts them if immediate loading is active, while the `only()` method adjusts the set to ensure only the specified fields are loaded immediately. This analysis suggests that the logic for managing `deferred_loading` during method chaining needs adjustments to align with developer expectations, particularly when `defer()` is chained after `only()`.

Conversely, `only()` sets these fields to be loaded immediately, effectively removing them from the `deferred_loading` set if they were previously deferred. The key issue arises when `defer()` is chained after `only()`: the expectation is that only the fields specified in `only()` should be loaded, but followed by any additional fields deferred by subsequent `defer()` calls.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
