The expected behavior is that calling .defer() after .only() should not load all fields but instead should adhere to the restrictions set by .only() first. However, the actual SQL queries generated include all fields, which is not the expected behavior. As a result, it seems the core logic handling deferred and immediate loading of fields in Django's Query class is relevant for addressing this issue. Specifically, the methods add_deferred_loading and add_immediate_loading, along with the initialization of the deferred_loading attribute, are key to understanding and potentially fixing the problem. Furthermore, the initialization and methods of the QuerySet class, particularly defer(), are also pertinent as they interface with the Query class. These methods and attributes need to be examined more closely to ensure that the logic handling the immediate and deferred loading of fields aligns with the expected behavior detailed in the reported issue.",

Specifically, it points out that when `defer()` is chained with `only()`, it does not clear the deferred fields as expected, leading to the selection of unexpected fields in the generated SQL query. To address this, relevant code spans need to be identified that handle the logic of deferred and immediate loading of fields. \n\nFrom the file context and search results, several key spans are relevant:\n1. `QuerySet.defer` from `django/db/models/query.py`: This method is responsible for deferring the loading of specified fields, but it does not account for the current state of deferred fields when called after `only()`.\n2. `Query.add_deferred_loading` and `Query.add_immediate_loading` from `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: These methods manage the sets of fields to be deferred or immediately loaded. The issue likely involves how these methods interact when `defer()` and `only()` are chained.\n3. `QuerySet.only` from `django/db/models/query.py`: This method sets the fields to be loaded immediately, but it should also manage the interaction with deferred fields when `defer()` is subsequently called.\n\nThe search results confirm the presence of these methods, and the additional method `Query.clear_deferred_loading` indicates the mechanism to reset deferred loading, which might be relevant if a reset is needed when transitioning from `only()` to `defer()`. These identified code spans cover the core functionality related to managing field loading strategies in Django's ORM and should be sufficient to begin understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
