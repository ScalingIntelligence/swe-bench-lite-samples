The Company model example given expects certain fields to be excluded from the SQL query based on the chaining order, but this is not the case. The relevant code spans need to be examined to understand how .defer() and .only() are implemented and how they manipulate the query. In the provided search results, the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` contains the methods `defer()` and `only()`. These methods are key to understanding the issue because they define how deferred and immediate loading of fields are handled. The methods use `clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields)` and `clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)` respectively, which imply that the Query class or its methods `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` might be responsible for the undesired behavior. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` has a method `deferred_to_columns()` that seems to be involved in how columns are treated when deferred loading is applied. These pieces of code provide a starting point to investigate how deferred and immediate loading interact and why the expected SQL query behaviors are not met.",

Additionally, the SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py includes a method that seems to handle field deferring during SQL compilation, which further suggests that this codebase area is highly relevant to the issue.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
