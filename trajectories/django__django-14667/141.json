I have identified relevant code spans that address the logic for both .defer() and .only() methods within the QuerySet class. Additionally, I've identified code spans within the Query class that handle deferred loading and immediate loading, which are central to this issue. Notably, the 'QuerySet.defer' and 'QuerySet.only' methods interact with the 'Query' class to manage which fields are deferred or immediately loaded. The 'Query.deferred_to_data' method is particularly relevant as it effectively translates deferred field handling into concrete data loading strategies. This process determines how SQL fields are chosen based on whether fields are deferred or loaded immediately. Thus, these code spans offer a comprehensive view of how Django's ORM handles deferred fields in QuerySets and align closely with the reported issue concerning unexpected SQL generation while using .defer() and .only(). Furthermore, the issue could likely involve potential conflicts or edge cases not handled by current logic, as evidenced by the different scenarios described in the input. As a result, the identified code spans provide a strong basis for understanding and potentially remedying the issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
