The analysis starts with examining the QuerySet class for the defer() and only() methods, which are critical for managing which fields are deferred or immediately loaded. These methods interact with the Query class that handles the SQL query construction. Key methods in Query such as add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() are responsible for updating the state of loaded and deferred fields, and they are likely places to look for issues related to the reported behavior. Additionally, examining the deferred_to_data() method in Query which controls how fields are deferred can provide insight into the logic used to construct the SQL query based on deferred fields. The search results indicate that both the QuerySet and Query classes have methods directly related to the functionality reported in the issue. These methods are: QuerySet.defer(), QuerySet.only(), Query.add_deferred_loading(), Query.add_immediate_loading(), and Query.deferred_to_data(). These methods are the primary focus as they are directly involved in managing the deferred and immediate field loading in Django's ORM. Given this information, it is clear that the relevant sections of code needed to investigate and potentially fix the issue are contained within these code spans.",

The issue describes unexpected SQL queries generated when `.defer()` follows `.only()`, contrary to the expected behavior of only selecting specific fields. The analysis involves understanding how `defer()` and `only()` methods modify the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class, and how the `deferred_to_data` method processes these deferred and immediate loading fields. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns` method uses the `deferred_to_data` method to apply these loading strategies during SQL query compilation.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans include the `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods in `django/db/models/query.py`, which directly affect the deferred loading settings. The `Query.deferred_to_data()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` methods in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` handle the logic for converting deferred loading settings into actual field loading decisions. Furthermore, the `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` uses these decisions to prepare SQL columns accordingly.\n\nThe identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior to ensure that deferred fields are handled correctly when using `only()` and `defer()` in combination.",
