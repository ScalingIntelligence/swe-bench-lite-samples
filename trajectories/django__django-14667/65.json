The analysis of the existing code and the new search results revealed that the methods `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` are partly responsible for handling deferred loading and immediate loading of fields, respectively. However, the current implementation of these methods does not properly handle the scenario where `.defer()` is chained after `.only()`, leading to the unexpected SQL queries that load all fields instead of just the necessary ones. The relevant code spans identified include the methods `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, which are responsible for managing the deferred and immediate loading states. These methods do not currently account for the interaction between deferred and immediate loading states when both methods are used in sequence, which is the main cause of the reported issue. Based on this understanding, the relevant code spans are from the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, specifically the `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` methods.",
