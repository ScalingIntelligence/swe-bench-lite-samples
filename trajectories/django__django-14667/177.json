The issue is that chaining `.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")` unexpectedly loads all fields instead of expected fields. This could be due to how the `defer` and `only` methods handle field exclusion and inclusion logic. To address this, it's necessary to closely inspect the logic in these methods and potentially how they interact with the SQL query generation process. Given the context of the already identified files and the nature of the problem, the focus should be on the `query.py` and `compiler.py` files which deal with SQL query construction and field handling. Specifically, the `add_deferred_loading`, `add_immediate_loading`, `deferred_to_columns`, and `deferred_to_data` methods might play a crucial role in this behavior.",

The key elements to focus on are the handling of deferred and immediate loading of fields in the `Query` class, specifically the `deferred_to_data`, `add_deferred_loading`, and `add_immediate_loading` methods. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class's `deferred_to_columns` method is relevant for handling deferred loading during the SQL compilation process. These methods and their interactions within the codebase likely contribute to the unexpected behavior described in the issue. By examining these parts of the code, we can understand how the deferred and immediate loading logic is implemented and determine if the issue arises from improper handling when chaining `defer()` and `only()`.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
