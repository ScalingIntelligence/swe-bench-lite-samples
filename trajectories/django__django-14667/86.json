Upon examining the provided source code, I focused on methods within the QuerySet class: .defer() and .only(), as well as the handling of deferred loading in the Query class. The .defer() method adds fields to deferred loading, while the .only() method specifies immediate loading fields. The issue seems rooted in how these methods are chained and how deferred loading is managed between them. Specifically, the .defer() method seems to reset the deferred loading settings when called after .only(), causing all fields to be loaded instead of the expected subset. The code analysis shows that .defer() and .only() methods in QuerySet class manipulate the deferred_loading attribute in Query class, but without logic to handle previously set loading preferences. This oversight results in the described unexpected behavior. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant for fixing the issue, providing a starting point to adjust how field loading preferences are stored and interpreted when chaining .defer() after .only().",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
