Specifically, chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not produce the expected SQL query due to incorrect handling of deferred fields. From the search results, the relevant methods to investigate are `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, and their interaction with `Query.add_deferred_loading()`. The code provided shows the implementation of these methods, and they are located in the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files. The `QuerySet.defer()` method calls `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, which manages the deferred field loading. However, the issue might be arising from the order in which methods are chained and how the `deferred_loading` attribute is managed. Further review is needed to determine if the implementation aligns correctly with the reported issue. The identified code spans are from the `QuerySet` class in `query.py` and the `Query` class in `query.py`.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
