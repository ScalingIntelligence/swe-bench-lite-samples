Specifically, the issue notes that when `defer()` is chained after `only()`, the SQL query generated selects all fields instead of only the fields specified. The key elements to focus on are the methods `defer()`, `only()`, and how they interact with each other. In the provided code, the `QuerySet` class has methods `defer()` and `only()` that manipulate the query's deferred loading behavior. The `Query` class also has methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` which are central to the deferred and immediate loading logic respectively. The analysis of these methods reveals the logic responsible for handling deferred and immediate loading of fields. This logic currently does not account for the scenario where `defer()` is called after `only()`, leading to the reported issue where all fields are loaded in the SQL query instead of only the specified ones. Thus, the identified code spans are directly related to the methods responsible for field loading behavior, which are relevant to addressing the reported issue. These spans include the implementations of `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
