The expected SQL query does not match the actual output, particularly when .defer() follows .only(). This indicates a potential problem in how deferred and immediate loading fields are handled within the QuerySet and Query classes. I analyzed the provided code spans and identified several key methods: QuerySet.defer(), QuerySet.only(), Query.add_deferred_loading(), and Query.add_immediate_loading(). These methods are crucial for handling the deferred and immediate loading of fields in a QuerySet. The issue likely arises from the interplay between these methods when chained. For instance, the problem could stem from how Query.deferred_loading is managed, specifically whether it correctly reflects the state changes after each method call. The code does not currently account for the possibility of chaining .defer() after .only() and how this impacts the deferred_loading attribute.",

Specifically, the issue is that the expected SQL query does not exclude deferred fields when `defer()` is used after `only()`. The provided context highlights the implementation of these methods in `QuerySet` and `Query` classes. The new search results include the `SQLCompiler` class, which is responsible for compiling SQL queries. This class contains methods that are potentially relevant to the issue, such as `get_select()`, `get_default_columns()`, and `deferred_to_columns()`. These methods are involved in constructing the SELECT clause of the SQL query, which is where the issue seems to lie. It's crucial to analyze these methods to understand how they handle deferred and only fields. Upon review, it appears that the current implementation of `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` does not account for the potential conflict between deferred and only fields, which might explain the reported issue. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the search results, focusing on how deferred fields are handled in the SQL compilation process.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
