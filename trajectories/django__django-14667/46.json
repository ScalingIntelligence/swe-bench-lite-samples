These methods are critical for controlling which fields are loaded from the database, and it's essential to understand their interaction. Based on the issue description, the problem arises when chaining defer() after only(), and the SQL query generated includes unexpected fields. This suggests that the logic in the defer() and only() methods might not be handling the deferred loading and immediate loading settings appropriately when they're used in conjunction. My analysis led me to focus on the QuerySet.defer and QuerySet.only spans within django/db/models/query.py. These spans contain the implementation of the defer() and only() methods, respectively, and they directly influence how field selections are managed in a QuerySet. By examining these methods, I can determine if the logic correctly updates the deferred and immediate loading lists and whether it has any conditions that might interfere with each other during chaining. This will help in identifying whether the issue lies in how the methods are implemented or how they interact with each other. It's important to note that the problem could also extend to the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which is where the logic for deferred and immediate loading is ultimately applied to the SQL query generation. However, for now, I've focused on the specific methods reported in the issue.",

The issue highlights that when `defer()` follows `only()`, unexpected SQL queries are generated, selecting all fields instead of the expected subset. To address this, we need to examine the methods `defer()` and `only()` in the `QuerySet` class and their interaction with the `deferred_loading` attribute in the `Query` class. The current context shows the definitions of `defer()` and `only()` in `QuerySet`, but lacks the handling of the `deferred_loading` attribute, which is crucial for understanding how fields are deferred or immediately loaded. In the search results, we find the `Query` class with methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()`, which manage the `deferred_loading` attribute.
