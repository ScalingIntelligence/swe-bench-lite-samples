The issue specifically points out that chaining these methods does not produce the expected SQL query that selects only the necessary fields. This discrepancy can lead to inefficiencies in database queries.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in two files: `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These files contain the implementation of the `QuerySet` class and its methods (`__init__`, `defer`) and the `Query` class that handles SQL generation and deferred loading of fields.\n\nThe `QuerySet.defer` method is responsible for marking the specified fields as deferred, meaning they will not be loaded from the database unless explicitly accessed. The `Query.add_deferred_loading` method is used to add the fields to the set of deferred fields. However, there is no mention of how the `only` method interacts with deferred loading, which might suggest a gap in the codebase that could explain the reported issue.\n\nTo solve the reported issue, it would be necessary to investigate further how `only()` method is implemented and how it interacts with deferred loading. However, based on the current search results, we have identified the relevant code spans that deal with deferred loading and the `defer()` method.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans are in the `django/db/models/query.py` file, specifically the `QuerySet.defer` method, and in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, specifically the `Query.clear_deferred_loading` and `Query.add_deferred_loading` methods.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
