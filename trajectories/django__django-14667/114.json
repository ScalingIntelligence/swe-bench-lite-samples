The user expects that chaining these methods will cause the QuerySet to load only specific fields, but instead, the QuerySet loads all fields. This discrepancy is significant and needs to be addressed. The relevant code spans provided in the search results include the definitions of the `QuerySet` class and its methods: `defer()`, `only()`, as well as the `Query` class methods related to deferred loading: `add_deferred_loading()`, `add_immediate_loading()`, and `deferred_to_data()`. These methods are responsible for managing which fields are deferred or loaded immediately. It's crucial to review how these methods interact with each other when chained, to identify why the expected SQL query behavior is not achieved. Additionally, the `Query.deferred_to_data()` method is critical for understanding how deferred fields are processed and should be closely examined to ensure it correctly handles the fields being deferred or loaded immediately. The provided code spans cover the essential parts of the logic needed to address the issue, including the initialization of the QuerySet and Query classes, the logic for adding deferred and immediate loading fields, and the method for converting deferred fields to data. These sections should be sufficient to diagnose and potentially fix the problem described in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
