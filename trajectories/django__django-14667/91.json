I checked the provided <search_results> and found several relevant segments in the 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' files that relate to the .defer() and .only() methods, including their definitions and how they handle field selection. I noted in particular the 'QuerySet.defer' and 'QuerySet.only' methods as well as the 'Query.add_deferred_loading' and 'Query.deferred_to_data' methods, which deal with the internal handling of deferred loading of fields. After careful evaluation, I identified these methods as directly related to the issue described and chose to include them in the 'identified_spans' array.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
