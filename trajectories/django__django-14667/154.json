The issue describes that when .defer() is chained with .only(), it does not clear the deferred field as expected, leading to all fields being loaded in the SQL query instead of the expected subset. To identify relevant code, I focused on methods related to field selection in the QuerySet class, specifically the .defer() and .only() methods. I found that these methods manage deferred loading, but there's no clear handling to reset or manage state when chaining these methods. The compiler file provided context on SQL compilation but did not directly relate to the issue's handling of field selection. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those within the QuerySet class's .defer() and .only() methods in 'django/db/models/query.py'.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
