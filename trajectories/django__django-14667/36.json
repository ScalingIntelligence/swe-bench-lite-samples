The SQL queries generated do not match the expected behavior as they load all fields instead of just the specified fields. This could be related to how the `Query` class handles field selection or how the SQL compiler interprets these methods. To address this, we should focus on the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes, particularly methods like `defer()`, `only()`, and their interactions with field selection mechanisms.",

The analysis of the search results shows that the relevant code spans are mostly within the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. Specifically, the methods `defer()`, `only()`, `_filter_or_exclude()`, and `_filter_or_exclude_inplace()` in `QuerySet` and `add_deferred_loading()`, `add_immediate_loading()`, and `clear_deferred_loading()` in `Query` are key to understanding how deferred and immediate loading of fields is managed. These methods are crucial because they directly handle the logic for which fields to include or exclude in the query, thus potentially addressing the issue described. The `deferred_to_data` method in `Query` also plays a role in managing field loading strategies. Further examination of these methods and how they interact could uncover the source of the issue and provide guidance on potential fixes.",
