The provided code spans include the definitions of QuerySet and Query classes, with the relevant methods: defer(), only(), clear_deferred_loading(), add_deferred_loading(), and add_immediate_loading(). These methods manage the deferred loading of fields in the QuerySet. The issue's main concern is the unexpected SQL query generated when defer() is called after only(). The analysis of the provided code reveals that the only() method adds fields to immediate loading, while defer() adds fields to deferred loading, but there isn't a mechanism provided in the code spans to handle the interaction between these two methods when chained, which seems to be the source of the problem. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant as they directly pertain to the issue and may need adjustments to ensure proper handling of field loading in chained method calls.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
