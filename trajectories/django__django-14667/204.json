Specifically, the issue highlights that chaining .defer() after .only() does not result in the SQL query selecting only the expected fields, which is a deviation from the expected behavior. To address this, it is important to examine the relevant code spans handling these methods within the QuerySet class. By doing so, it becomes evident that the methods .defer() and .only() are implemented to handle deferred and immediate loading of fields respectively. However, the existing implementation might be missing the logic to correctly handle the chaining of these methods in a way that aligns with the expected behavior as described in the issue. The analysis of the provided search results reveals these core methods, which are likely to be the starting points for any potential fix or enhancement required to align the behavior of these methods with the expectations of the reported issue.",
