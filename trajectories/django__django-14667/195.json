This is observed in the case of a simple Company model with fields: id, name, trade_number, and country. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in the `django/db/models/query.py` file that pertain to the `QuerySet` class's `defer` and `only` methods, as well as in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file that involves the `Query` class's handling of deferred and immediate loading of fields. Specifically, the code spans for `QuerySet.defer`, `QuerySet.only`, `Query.add_deferred_loading`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading` seem pertinent to addressing the issue. These methods deal with how fields are deferred or immediately loaded in a queryset, which directly relates to the problem described in the issue. Looking at these methods, it appears that while `QuerySet.defer` and `QuerySet.only` handle the chaining of methods, the actual logic for adding and clearing deferred loading is managed by `Query.add_deferred_loading` and `Query.add_immediate_loading`. Yet, based on the issue description, it seems like the logic in these methods might not be handling the interaction between deferring and only loading fields correctly when methods are chained, resulting in the SQL query selecting unexpected fields. Further investigation into these methods, particularly how deferred_loading is being updated and applied in the context of chained method calls, would be necessary to fully understand and address the issue.",

The provided context and search results focus on the relevant parts of the Django ORM code related to these methods, specifically in the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes.\n\n1. **Analyzing User Instructions**: The issue clearly states that chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not behave as expected, leading to all fields being selected, which is not the intended behavior. The expected SQL query should only select the non-deferred fields.\n\n2. **Review Current Context**: The provided context includes the `QuerySet` class with its `defer()` and `only()` methods, and the `Query` class with its `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` methods.\n\n3. **Process New Search Results**: The new search results include the `SQLCompiler` class, which is used during the SQL query compilation process. This class includes the `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()` methods, which are relevant for determining which columns to include in the SQL query based on the deferred loading settings.\n\n3.1. **Thoroughly analyzing each code span**: The `SQLCompiler` class's `get_default_columns()` method checks which columns to include based on the deferred loading settings, and the `deferred_to_columns()` method returns the columns based on deferred loading.\n\n3.2. **Matching with key elements**: The key elements here are the deferred loading settings and how they affect the SQL query generation. The methods `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()` are directly related to this key element.\n\n3.3. **Evaluating relevance**: Given the issue at hand, these methods are highly relevant for determining the root cause and potential fixes for the reported issue.\n\n3.4. **Reviewing entire sections**: The `get_default_columns()` method is crucial as it determines which columns to include in the SQL query, which is directly related to the issue's expected behavior.\n\n3.5. **Identifying relevant code spans**: The relevant code spans are `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()` methods because they handle the deferred loading logic which directly relates to the issue.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The identified relevant code spans are `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()` from the `SQLCompiler` class. There are no other relevant parts of the codebase found in the search results for the reported issue.",

The `Query` class manages the `deferred_loading` attribute and includes methods `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` to handle these settings. The `SQLCompiler` class is responsible for transforming these settings into SQL queries, specifically in the `get_default_columns` method, which determines which fields to include in the query based on the `deferred_loading` settings. Therefore, the provided context seems sufficient to understand and address the issue related to the interaction between `defer` and `only` methods in the QuerySet.
