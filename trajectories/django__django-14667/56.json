Specifically, when chaining `.defer()` after `.only()`, it doesn't clear the deferred field as expected, resulting in all fields being loaded in the SQL query instead of just the specified ones. Given the files provided, it's evident that `query.py` and `compiler.py` are likely places to look, as they handle the SQL query construction and compilation. The `defer` and `only` methods are also defined in `query.py`, suggesting it's a good starting point for the search.",

The expected behavior is that when .defer() is called after .only(), it should modify the SQL query to only include the non-deferred fields. However, the observed behavior is that all fields are being selected, which is not the expected outcome.\n\nTo address this, we need to examine the relevant methods in the QuerySet class: .defer() and .only(). These methods are responsible for handling deferred and immediate loading of fields, respectively. By reviewing these methods, we can identify potential issues or inconsistencies in how they interact with each other.\n\nThe search results provide the implementation of these methods. We can see that each method creates a clone of the QuerySet and modifies the query object (clone.query) by adding deferred or immediate loading fields. The issue might lie in the interaction between these two methods or in how the Query object processes these modifications.\n\nSpecifically, we should focus on the .add_deferred_loading() and .add_immediate_loading() methods called within .defer() and .only(), respectively. Checking the implementation and logic of these methods should help in understanding why the expected SQL query modifications are not occurring.\n\nFrom the provided code, none of the code spans directly address the observed issue, but examining these methods closely will likely reveal the underlying cause or require further investigation into the Query object's handling of deferred and immediate fields.",
