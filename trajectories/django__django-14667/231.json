The search results provide the implementation of these methods in the `QuerySet` class within `django/db/models/query.py` and the `Query` class within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The `defer()` method adds fields to the deferred loading set, while the `only()` method replaces the immediate loading set with the provided fields. The methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` in the `Query` class handle these operations. However, the issue indicates that chaining these methods does not produce the expected SQL query, suggesting a potential bug in how deferred and immediate loading sets are managed when the methods are chained. To address the issue, focus should be on the interplay between the `defer()` and `only()` methods in the `QuerySet` class and the underlying `Query` class methods that handle deferred and immediate loading sets. Analyzing the process of chaining these methods and how the deferred_loading attribute is managed is crucial for identifying the root cause and describing the necessary modifications.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
