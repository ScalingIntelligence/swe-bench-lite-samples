Specifically, when using .only() followed by .defer() on a queryset of a Company model, the SQL query generated includes all fields rather than the expected subset. The issue suggests an inconsistency in how Django handles field selection when these methods are chained.\n\nGiven the search results, several key areas within the QuerySet class are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only()**: These methods handle the deferring and inclusion of specific fields, respectively. The issue reported likely involves how these methods interact or how the query is constructed after chaining them.\n\n2. **QuerySet._filter_or_exclude_inplace() and QuerySet._filter_or_exclude()**: These methods are likely not directly related to the issue but could influence how the query is modified or constructed.\n\n3. **QuerySet._chain() and QuerySet._clone()**: These methods are crucial for understanding how the QuerySet class manages chaining and cloning operations, which is essential for analyzing how method chaining influences query construction.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant spans appear to be those defining the defer() and only() methods within the QuerySet class, as well as the _chain() and _clone() methods for understanding the overall chaining and cloning process.\n\nTo fully resolve the issue, it would be beneficial to review and debug the interactions between the defer() and only() methods and how they modify the query during chaining. Additionally, understanding the broader context of _chain() and _clone() could reveal how query modifications accumulate during method chaining.",
