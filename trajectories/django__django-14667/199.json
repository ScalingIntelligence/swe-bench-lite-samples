To address this, we need to understand how these methods interact within the QuerySet class and the Query class. From the search results, we can see that the QuerySet class contains the `defer()` and `only()` methods, which manipulate the `deferred_loading` attribute of the Query class. Notably, the `defer()` method adds fields to the deferred loading set, and the `only()` method adds immediate loading fields, but it does not handle the case where the same field is deferred after being specified in `only()`. This explains the unexpected behavior observed in the reported issue. To resolve this, we need to ensure that when `defer()` follows `only()`, the fields specified in `only()` are appropriately handled and not included in the final SQL query. The relevant code spans include the methods `defer()`, `only()`, and the internal state management in the Query class related to `deferred_loading`.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
