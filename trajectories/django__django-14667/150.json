The problem is that chaining `.defer(\"name\")` after `.only(\"name\")` does not work as expected, leading to all fields being loaded instead of just the non-deferred ones. This suggests an issue within the implementation of these methods in the QuerySet class or the SQL generation logic in related classes. To address this, we should focus on the `QuerySet` class itself and related SQL query compilation logic.",

Specifically, the issue is that when `defer()` is called after `only()`, it doesn't clear the deferred fields as expected, leading to unexpected SQL queries that select all fields instead of the intended subset. From the provided search results, it's clear that these methods are defined in the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py`, and their behavior affects the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. Relevant methods include `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.clear_deferred_loading()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, and `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()`. These methods handle the logic for deferred and immediate field loading. The issue likely arises from the interaction between these methods when `defer()` is chained after `only()`. By examining these methods, we can identify where the logic breaks down and how to fix it to ensure that the intended fields are deferred or only loaded as expected.",

The issue specifically mentions the unexpected behavior when these methods are chained. The QuerySet class and related SQL query logic (in query.py and compiler.py) are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving this issue. The presence of the defer() and only() methods in the QuerySet class and the related methods for handling deferred and immediate loading fields in the Query class suggest that the necessary elements to diagnose and potentially fix the issue are present in the provided context. The SQLCompiler class also provides insight into how SQL queries are compiled based on the state of the QuerySet, which is relevant to understanding the issue further. Given the provided context includes the problematic methods and logic that drive the generation of these queries, all relevant parts to address the issue seem to be covered.",

For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
