The issue is that the SQL queries generated do not match the expected behavior, selecting all fields instead of only the intended ones. I will analyze the provided code to identify relevant spans that might involve the handling of deferred fields and the logic behind query construction.\n\n1. **QuerySet Class (django/db/models/query.py)**:\n   - `QuerySet.defer()`: This method is directly related to the problem, as it's responsible for handling deferred fields. It calls `add_deferred_loading()` on the query object, which should add fields to the deferred list.\n   - `QuerySet.__init__()`: This initialization method sets up the `QuerySet` object, including attributes like `self._fields` and `self._deferred_filter`, which can affect how deferred fields are managed.\n\n2. **Query Class (django/db/models/sql/query.py)**:\n   - `Query.clear_deferred_loading()`: Clears any deferred loading settings, which might be relevant if erroneous behavior comes from a non-empty deferred loading configuration initially.\n   - `Query.add_deferred_loading()`: This method actually manages the deferred fields list. It updates the `deferred_loading` attribute based on whether fields are being added or removed. This is central to the issue since the error could stem from incorrect updates to this attribute.\n\n3. **SQLCompiler Class (django/db/models/sql/compiler.py)**:\n   - `SQLCompiler.__init__()`: Initializes the `SQLCompiler` object, which is involved in converting the query logic to SQL. Although not directly involved in the deferred fields logic, understanding how query compilation initialization can affect query output is important.\n   - `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns()`: This method could be relevant for understanding how deferred loading settings impact the actual column selection in the generated SQL. It interacts with `self.query.deferred_to_data`.\n\nGiven the information above, I will identify the spans in the code that directly interact with or are likely to impact the handling of deferred fields during query construction. These spans will be crucial to review for understanding and fixing the reported issue.",

By examining these sections, I can determine if the code correctly handles the chaining of these methods. The .defer() method adds fields to the deferred_loading set, while the .only() method should clear the deferred_loading set or adjust it to include only the specified fields.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
