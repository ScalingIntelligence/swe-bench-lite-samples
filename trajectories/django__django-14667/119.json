These methods are responsible for managing the deferred and immediate loading of fields. Additionally, the SQLCompiler class and its methods like get_default_columns() and deferred_to_columns() are relevant as they handle the actual column selection in SQL queries based on deferred loading settings. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how field selection is managed and how the SQL query generation is influenced by the defer() and only() methods.
