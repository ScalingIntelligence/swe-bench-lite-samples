Specifically, the issue describes that when .defer() is chained after .only(), unexpected fields are selected in the SQL query. This suggests that there might be an issue with how deferred and immediate loading are being managed in the QuerySet class and its associated SQL Query class.\n\nGiven this, the relevant code spans are located in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py. In django/db/models/query.py, the methods QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only() are of primary interest. These methods handle the adding of deferred and immediate loading fields, respectively. The implementation of these methods involves interacting with the Query class, specifically through the Query.add_deferred_loading() and Query.add_immediate_loading() methods, which are defined in django/db/models/sql/query.py.\n\nAdditionally, the Query class's handling of deferred and immediate loading is crucial, as evidenced by the deferred_loading attribute and the methods that modify it. The behavior of these methods when fields are added or removed from the deferred or immediate loading sets could be contributing to the issue. This indicates that the entire section of code dealing with deferred and immediate loading in both files is relevant to understanding and addressing the reported issue.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans identified for this issue are those in the QuerySet class for the .defer() and .only() methods, and in the Query class for methods managing deferred_loading and handling immediate loading.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
