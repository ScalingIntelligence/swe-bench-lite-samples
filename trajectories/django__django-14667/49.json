It seems that when `defer()` follows `only()`, the deferred fields are not cleared as expected. This leads to SQL queries that select all fields instead of the expected subset. To resolve this issue, it's necessary to investigate the implementation of these methods in the `QuerySet` class and related classes such as `Query` and `SQLCompiler`. The goal is to understand how field deferral and loading are managed and ensure that chaining `only()` with `defer()` behaves as expected.",

The QuerySet.defer() and QuerySet.only() methods are critical as they directly manipulate the deferred loading state. The Query.deferred_to_data method is also relevant as it processes the deferred loading state. Furthermore, the SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns method, which calls Query.deferred_to_data, is part of the SQL compilation process and should be examined.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
