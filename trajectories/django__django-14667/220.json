Specifically, after calling `.only('name')` followed by `.defer('name')`, all fields are selected instead of just the primary key. This suggests a potential bug in the logic handling the deferred fields in the `QuerySet` class or related classes. To investigate, we should focus on the `QuerySet` class and related classes like `Query` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, as well as `SQLCompiler` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which are likely involved in composing and compiling SQL queries influenced by these methods.",

The expected behavior is that .defer() should clear the fields specified in .only() when chained, but this is not occurring as expected. The search results include relevant code spans from django/db/models/query.py, specifically within the QuerySet class, which defines the .defer() and .only() methods. These methods handle adding deferred loading and immediate loading of fields, respectively. The issue suggests that the logic for handling these fields when chaining methods might be flawed or incomplete. Therefore, the code spans defining .defer() and .only() need to be reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure the correct SQL queries are generated.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
