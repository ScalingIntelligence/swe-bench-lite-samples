The relevant code spans identified are from the `QuerySet` class methods (`defer` and `only`) and the `Query` class methods (`add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading`). These methods handle the logic for deferred and immediate loading of fields, respectively. The analysis shows that the current implementation does not handle the sequence of defer and only calls as the user expects, leading to the need for a modification in the logic to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans include:\n- QuerySet.defer\n- QuerySet.only\n- Query.add_deferred_loading\n- Query.add_immediate_loading\n\nThese methods need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that the deferred fields are cleared appropriately when `.defer()` is called after `.only()`, especially when `None` is passed to the methods.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
