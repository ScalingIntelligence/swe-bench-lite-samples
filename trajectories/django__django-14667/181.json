The key elements to focus on are the `defer` and `only` methods within the `QuerySet` class, as well as the `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods in the `Query` class, which handle the deferred and immediate loading of fields respectively. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data` method in the `Query` class is responsible for managing how deferred fields are processed. These methods need to be examined in detail to understand how they interact and potentially where the issue might arise. The provided code spans include all the necessary methods and relevant logic handling field deferral and immediate loading. The analysis indicates that the issue likely arises from how the deferred and immediate loading sets are updated and reconciled within the `Query` class, possibly due to the sequencing or the logic applied when adding deferred vs. immediate fields. Further examination of the logic within these methods is required to pinpoint the exact cause and to determine if the provided code spans are sufficient to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
