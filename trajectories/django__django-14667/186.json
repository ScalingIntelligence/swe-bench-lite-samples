The reported issue indicates that chaining `defer()` after `only()` results in loading unexpected fields, which suggests that the logic for handling these two methods might be interfering with each other or not implemented as intended. After analyzing the provided code, it's clear that the methods `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` are responsible for setting up deferred loading and immediate loading of fields, respectively. However, there is a lack of specific handling for the interaction between these two methods, which might explain the unexpected behavior witnessed. The `Query` class methods `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()` manage the sets of fields to be deferred or immediately loaded, but there seems to be no logic to handle how adding deferred fields after immediate fields should be processed under certain circumstances. This oversight could be causing the issue described. To further verify and potentially fix this, one would need to look into how these sets of fields interact, especially in contexts where `defer()` follows `only()`, and ensure that the resultant SQL query accurately reflects the intended selection of fields. Understanding the `deferred_to_data()` method might also provide insights into how Django converts deferred field sets into actual query elements.",

Specifically, it mentions that chaining .defer() after .only() doesn't clear the deferred fields as expected, leading to unexpected SQL queries that select all fields instead of the expected subset. To address this issue, I examined the code spans related to these methods in the provided context and search results. I identified the relevant methods in the QuerySet class (QuerySet.defer and QuerySet.only) and their corresponding methods in the Query class (Query.add_deferred_loading and Query.add_immediate_loading) that manage deferred and immediate loading of fields, respectively. Additionally, I noted the deferred_to_data method in the Query class, which processes the deferred loading logic, and the deferred_to_columns method in the SQLCompiler class responsible for handling column-level deferred loading settings. These methods seem crucial for understanding and addressing the issue at hand. After reviewing the code, it is clear that the current implementation might not properly reconcile the effects of chaining .defer() after .only(). This analysis suggests that the identified spans contain the necessary code to understand and potentially fix the issue, though further investigation into the reconciliation process within the deferred loading logic might be required for a complete solution.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
