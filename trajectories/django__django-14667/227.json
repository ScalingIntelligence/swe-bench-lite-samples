The expected SQL queries are not being generated as expected, leading to the selection of more fields than intended. To resolve this, we need to closely examine the implementation of these methods in the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` and how they interact with the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. Additionally, understanding how the SQLCompiler processes these queries in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is crucial. Specifically, we should focus on the `add_deferred_loading()`, `add_immediate_loading()`, and `deferred_to_columns()` methods which likely handle the behavior of deferred and immediate field loading.",

Additionally, the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file contains the `SQLCompiler.deferred_to_columns` method which might be related to the deferred loading logic, although it's not directly invoked in the issue, it could be part of the broader handling of deferred fields in SQL compilation.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
