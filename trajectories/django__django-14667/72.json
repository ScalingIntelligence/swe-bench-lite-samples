The desired SQL queries are not generated as expected in certain chaining scenarios. To address this, we need to focus on the implementation of these methods within Django's source code, particularly in the `query.py` module where `QuerySet` and related classes are defined. Additionally, the `compiler.py` module may also be relevant for how SQL queries are compiled from QuerySets. Therefore, we should search for the `defer` and `only` methods in these specific files and potentially review other related methods and classes.",

These modules contain the implementations of the QuerySet class and methods like defer(), only(), and related internal functions that manage deferred and immediate loading of fields. Specifically, the defer() and only() methods likely need adjustments to handle the chaining behavior as per the issue description.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
