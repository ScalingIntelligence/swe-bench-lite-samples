The issue describes unexpected SQL queries being generated when chaining .defer() with .only(). Specifically, the queries select all fields instead of the expected subset. This suggests that there may be a bug or incorrect logic in the management of deferred and immediate loading fields within the QuerySet and Query classes. By examining the provided search results, I identified relevant sections of the code where the .defer() and .only() methods are defined, and where the deferred loading logic is handled. These sections include the `QuerySet.defer`, `QuerySet.only`, `Query.add_deferred_loading`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading` methods, as well as the `Query.deferred_to_data` method which processes deferred field loading. These sections of code directly relate to the behavior described in the issue, particularly how deferred fields and immediate loading fields are managed and applied. Given the scope of the issue outlined in the reported problem, these sections are likely to contain the necessary code to understand or resolve the issue, aligning closely with the expected SQL query behaviors described in the problem statement.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
