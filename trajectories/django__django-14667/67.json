Specifically, it highlights unexpected behavior when chaining these methods, where deferred fields are not cleared as expected. The issue provides examples illustrating the problem and the desired SQL query behavior.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that manage the interaction between `defer()` and `only()`, and how deferred fields are handled.\n\nThe provided `search_results` contain key sections of the Django framework's codebase related to QuerySets and SQL query generation. In particular, the span 'QuerySet.defer' in `django/db/models/query.py` is directly relevant as it defines the `defer()` method. Additionally, the 'Query.clear_deferred_loading' and 'Query.add_deferred_loading' spans in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` are pertinent as they deal with how deferred fields are managed internally within the Query class.\n\nThese code spans are essential for understanding and potentially resolving the issue reported, as they are directly responsible for the logic that determines which fields are deferred and how this affects the final SQL query. By focusing on these sections, we can gain insight into why the `defer()` method is not behaving as expected when chained with `only()`.",

The addition of immediate loading, though not directly mentioned in the issue, could be a relevant piece to ensure that fields specified by only() are indeed loaded immediately and not overridden by defer().

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
