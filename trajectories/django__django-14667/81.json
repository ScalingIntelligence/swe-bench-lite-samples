The issue specifically highlights unexpected SQL query field selection when these methods are chained. The key elements to focus on are the implementations of `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`. From the context-free search results, the most relevant code spans are those handling the addition and removal of fields to loading strategies. These methods directly control how fields are deferred or immediately loaded in a query, which aligns with the reported issue. It is crucial to ensure that these methods correctly interact and handle the mix of deferred and immediate loading settings to adjust the SQL query's field list accordingly. Evaluating the entire section of code ensures a complete understanding to accurately determine relevance. Based on the search results, no external references to other parts of the codebase indicating relevance were found that were not represented in the provided span results. It appears that the provided search results adequately cover the methods and logic that need examining to address the issue around chaining `.defer()` with `.only()` in `QuerySet`.",

Specifically, it appears that chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not clear the deferred fields as expected. This behavior is crucial to address because it can lead to unexpected SQL queries that load more fields than intended. The provided context already includes key methods involved in this process, such as `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, which manage the deferred and immediate loading of fields. These methods are critical for understanding how the fields are handled within the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes.\n\nIn the new search results, the `SQLCompiler` class is introduced, particularly the `get_default_columns()` and `deferred_to_columns()` methods. The `get_default_columns()` method is responsible for determining which columns to include in the SQL query based on the deferred or immediate loading settings. The `deferred_to_columns()` method assists by converting the deferred loading settings into a format that `get_default_columns()` can use. These methods are important because they show how the SQL compiler interprets and applies the deferred and immediate loading settings when generating SQL queries.\n\nGiven the relevance of these methods to the reported issue, especially in ensuring that the correct columns are included or excluded in the SQL query, they should be further examined. In addition, since the problem is described with a specific example involving the `Company` model, it is essential to ensure that this model's fields are being handled correctly by the mentioned methods.",

The context includes the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with managing deferred fields, specifically the `add_deferred_loading` and `add_immediate_loading` methods in the Query class. These methods' functionalities are apparent from the context, but the issue suggests there's a bug or integration problem when both methods are used together, leading to unexpected SQL queries.

These classes handle the logic for deferred loading, immediate loading, and SQL query construction, which are central to understanding and resolving the issue. The code spans provided in the search results include methods like `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, and `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` which directly relate to managing field loading in querysets. These methods are crucial for understanding how deferred and immediate loading are implemented and how fields are selected in SQL queries. The identified code spans provide a clear context for the issue, showing how deferred and immediate loading interact and how SQL queries are constructed based on these settings. This analysis is comprehensive enough to understand the current behavior, identify potential issues or inconsistencies with the expected behavior as described in the reported issue, and guide further actions to address it.",
