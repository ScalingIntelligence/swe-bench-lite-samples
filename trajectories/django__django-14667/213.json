The key issue is that .defer() does not properly adjust the loaded fields when preceded by .only(). This suggests that the methods .defer() and .only() in the QuerySet class are not correctly managing the deferred_loading attribute of the Query class. The relevant code spans identified are the implementations of .defer() and .only() in the QuerySet class and the methods add_deferred_loading() and add_immediate_loading() in the Query class. These spans directly deal with the management of deferred and immediate loading of fields.

Specifically, the issue is that chaining `defer()` after `only()` does not yield the expected SQL query, which should only select certain fields. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans that define these methods in Django's `QuerySet` and `Query` classes. Analyzing these spans, it is evident that the logic for handling deferred and immediate loading of fields is present. The `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` methods manage the deferred loading state, but there seems to be a gap in the handling of the state when chaining these methods. The `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods delegate the loading type setting to the `Query` class methods, but the logic for combining these settings when they are both used in a chain is not immediately clear from the provided code. This suggests that the bug may lie in how the state is managed across these method calls. Further investigation into the handling of `self.deferred_loading` in the `QuerySet` methods and how state is carried over in the `_chain()` method would be beneficial.",
