When `.defer()` follows `.only()`, the SQL query selects all fields instead of the desired fields. This suggests a problem in how Django handles the deferred and immediate field loading logic for these methods. To find the root cause, we should focus on methods and logic related to deferred and immediate field loading in the `QuerySet`, `Query`, and possibly `SQLCompiler` classes. Additional inspection of the interaction between these methods in the mentioned classes is necessary to understand why the SQL query selects all fields instead of the expected subset.",

Specifically, the issue is that the SQL query generated does not respect the deferred fields when `only()` is chained after `defer()`. For example, `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")` should ideally select only the `id` field, but it selects all fields. To address this, we need to examine the methods responsible for handling deferred and only fields: `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, and the underlying `Query` methods such as `add_deferred_loading()` and `add_immediate_loading()`. From the provided search results, we can see these methods in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These methods appear to manage the deferred loading of fields, but there seems to be a lack of specific handling for the interaction between `only()` and `defer()` that could explain the reported issue. The relevant code spans include `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()`. I will extract these spans as they appear to be directly related to the issue. Further analysis of the interaction between these methods in the context of the issue is necessary, but these spans are a good starting point.",

When `defer()` follows `only()`, the immediate loading list is set, but the subsequent `defer()` call attempts to manipulate this list without properly evaluating its current state.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
