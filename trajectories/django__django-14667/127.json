            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a problem with the `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods in Django's ORM when chaining them. The issue specifically points out that when a queryset is constructed with `.only()` followed by `.defer()`, the SQL query generated selects unexpected fields. This indicates a potential issue in how the deferred loading and immediate loading of fields are managed internally in the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the key methods `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` are the central pieces of code related to this issue. These methods manage the deferred and immediate loading of fields by manipulating the `deferred_loading` attribute of the `Query` object. The `deferred_loading` attribute is a tuple where the first element is a set of field names and the second element is a boolean indicating whether the fields are deferred (True) or immediately loaded (False).\n\nThe `Query.deferred_to_data()` method, which is used to convert deferred field information into data, also plays a crucial role in understanding how deferred fields are handled. It processes the `deferred_loading` attribute and applies the deferred field logic.\n\nThe issue could stem from the interaction between these methods when `QuerySet.defer()` is called after `QuerySet.only()`. Specifically, the logic in `Query.add_deferred_loading()` and `Query.add_immediate_loading()` might not be correctly adjusting the `deferred_loading` attribute to reflect the chained operations accurately.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans directly related to this issue include the `QuerySet.defer()`, `QuerySet.only()`, `Query.add_deferred_loading()`, `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, and potentially `Query.deferred_to_data()` methods. These spans are crucial for investigating and resolving the reported issue.",

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
