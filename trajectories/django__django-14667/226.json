Specifically, after calling `only()` followed by `defer()`, the SQL query selects all fields instead of just the primary key. This suggests that the internal state of the `QuerySet` or its query object is not correctly managing the deferred and immediate fields. The provided search results contain key methods such as `defer()`, `only()`, `add_deferred_loading()`, and `add_immediate_loading()` in the `QuerySet` and `Query` classes. These methods are directly related to managing the deferred and immediate loading of fields. The problem likely lies in how these methods update or interact with the internal state of the `Query` object, specifically with the attribute `deferred_loading` which manages the deferred fields. It seems there might be a miscalculation or an improper interaction between the methods when chaining them, leading to unexpected field selections in the final SQL query. Analyzing these methods more deeply is crucial to identify if they correctly update this state and handle the interaction between each other.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().\nDescription\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n"
