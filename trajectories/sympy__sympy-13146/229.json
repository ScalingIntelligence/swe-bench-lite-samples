The user's code attempts to simplify an expression `expr1 - expr2` where both expressions contain terms raised to non-integer powers. The desired outcome is to simplify this to zero, but SymPy currently leaves it in a partially simplified state.\n\nFrom the search results, several relevant functions and classes are identified:\n1. `powsimp` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`: This function simplifies powers with similar bases and identical exponents.\n2. `powdenest` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`: This function handles the denesting of powers.\n3. `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py`: This class represents a power expression and contains methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_power_base` which are relevant for evaluating and simplifying such expressions.\n4. `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py`: This is the base class for mathematical expressions in SymPy, containing methods like `simplify`, `separate`, and `factor` which are likely to be used in simplification processes.\n5. `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`: This is the main function for simplifying expressions, which likely uses or calls upon the aforementioned functions and classes.\n\nGiven these pieces, it's clear that the `simplify` function, along with methods in the `Pow` class and functions in `powsimp.py`, are central to addressing the user's issue. The code spans 'imports', 'powsimp', 'powdenest', 'Pow', 'Pow.__new__', 'Pow.base', 'Pow.exp', 'Pow._eval_power', 'Pow._eval_subs', 'Pow._eval_expand_power_base', 'Expr', 'Expr.simplify', and 'simplify' are all identified as relevant to the reported issue as they pertain to simplification of expressions involving powers.
