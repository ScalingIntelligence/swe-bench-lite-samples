The user's code attempts to simplify two expressions that should mathematically be equivalent to zero but does not achieve the desired result. The main focus of relevance here is understanding and potentially modifying the SymPy functions responsible for simplifying expressions (simplify function) and handling powers (Pow class). The search results provided include code from sympy/simplify/simplify.py, which defines the simplify function and its detailed behavior, including how it handles different types of expressions. Additionally, the sympy/core/power.py file contains detailed implementations and evaluations related to the Pow class, which is crucial for understanding and handling expressions with non-integer exponents. These results align well with the reported issue and should provide necessary context for addressing the problem. No further sections of code from search results seem directly relevant beyond these identified spans. However, it's noted that for a complete solution, deeper inspection and possibly modification of the simplify function or Pow class and their interactions might be necessary. Also, understanding the evalf function from sympy/core/evalf.py could be beneficial if numerical evaluation post-simplification is a concern, though it's less directly related to the reported issue of simplification failing to yield zero.\n\nIn summary, the identified spans from the simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py and properties and evaluations of Pow class in sympy/core/power.py are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue. They provide the necessary code for understanding and potentially modifying how SymPy simplifies expressions and handles powers, especially non-integer ones. Reviewing these sections is crucial for anyone attempting to debug or enhance SymPy's simplification process in relation to the given issue.",
