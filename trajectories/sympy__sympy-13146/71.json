Additionally, the 'signsimp' span includes the signsimp function, which is utilized within the simplify function. These spans are crucial as they directly relate to the simplification of mathematical expressions, particularly handling exponents and signs, which are key elements in the reported issue. The presence of these functions in the search results suggests that they might help in resolving the issue by providing a more robust method to simplify the expression to zero.
