This suggests a need to focus on the simplify function and its related components within SymPy, particularly those that handle powers and exponents. Upon reviewing the search results, several relevant files and functions are identified. The 'Expr.simplify' and 'Expr.powsimp' methods in sympy/core/expr.py are directly tied to the simplification of expressions, including those involving powers. Additionally, the 'powsimp' function in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py is specifically designed to handle the simplification of powers. Both of these are highly relevant to the issue at hand. Furthermore, the 'Pow' class in sympy/core/power.py, which represents power operations in SymPy, is essential for understanding how powers are handled within the library. These findings suggest that the current search results are relevant to the issue and contain the necessary code spans to address the problem. However, given the complexity of the issue, further analysis of these code spans in their entirety is required to ensure completeness and relevance. The provided search results do not need additional context, as they already cover the key parts of the relevant codebase related to powers and simplification.",

Specifically, the simmer method calls a function from sympy.simplify that takes the expression, attempts to simplify it, and returns the result. This method does not automatically simplify exponents, hence the output still has -0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5.",
