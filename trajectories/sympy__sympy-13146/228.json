The user's code snippet includes operations with symbols and powers, and the main problem is that the expression is not simplifying to zero as expected. This suggests that the simplification logic in sympy might not be handling the specific operation or format of the expression correctly. To address this, we need to focus on the parts of sympy that deal with exponent simplification, expression simplification, and potentially the handling of floating-point operations or rational numbers. We should look into the specific functions and classes that could impact the calculation and simplification of power expressions, including `simplify`, `Pow`, `Expr`, `Rational`, and related simplification algorithms like `powsimp` and `radsimp`.",

The provided search results include various SymPy modules that handle power operations and simplification. Notably, the 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' file contains a 'powsimp' function that is designed to simplify expressions by combining powers with similar bases and exponents. Additionally, the 'sympy/core/power.py' file defines the 'Pow' class, which handles properties and evaluations related to powers, such as base and exponent properties, and various evaluation methods including 'eval_power'. These are potentially relevant to handling the reported issue, as they could help manipulate and simplify the expression to achieve the desired outcome of reducing it to zero.
