The key areas of interest are the implementation and behavior of the `simplify` function and the `Pow` class, which handles exponentiation in SymPy. The provided search results include relevant code spans from `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. The `Pow` class methods, such as `__new__`, `_eval_power`, and `as_numer_denom`, are particularly relevant as they deal with the creation and evaluation of power expressions, which is central to the issue. Additionally, the `simplify` function itself is crucial, as it orchestrates the overall simplification process, leveraging methods like `trigsimp`, `powsimp`, etc. Based on the analysis, the identified code spans should provide insight into how expressions are handled and simplified in SymPy, aligning with the reported issue.",
