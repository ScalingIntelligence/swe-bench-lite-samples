The expression is of the form `expr1 = S(1)/2*x**2.5` and `expr2 = S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2`, and the result after simplification still shows the terms `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`. This suggests that the simplification function is not eliminating the terms as expected. We need to investigate the simplification functions and potentially the power handling within SymPy to understand why this is happening and how to resolve it.",

The function is complex and involves various strategies for combining exponents, handling non-commutative parts, and managing bases and exponents. This function is likely to be highly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nFrom `sympy/core/expr.py`, methods like `equivalents`, `is_polynomial`, `is_rational_function`, and `as_leading_term` are relevant for analyzing and manipulating expressions. However, the `powsimp` function from `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` appears to be the most directly related to the exponent simplification issue.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant code spans are those within the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, as they deal with the exact issue of exponent simplification.
