To address this, we need to delve into the code related to simplification and power handling in SymPy. Key files and functions that could be relevant include `sympy.simplify.simplify`, `sympy.simplify.powsimp`, and `sympy.core.power`. Specifically, we are looking for the `simplify` function that orchestrates the simplification process, the `powsimp` function that simplifies expressions with powers, and the `Pow` class in `sympy.core.power` that handles power operations. The code spans identified in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and `sympy/core/power.py` are crucial as they delve into the inner workings pertinent to the issue.\n\nUpon examination of the provided code spans, it is evident that they indeed contain the components necessary to understand and potentially resolve the issue. The `simplify` function, part of `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, is responsible for managing various simplification strategies including power simplification. The `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` plays a specific role in simplifying expressions involving powers. Furthermore, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` handles the core power operations and simplification logic, which is crucial to address the exponent not fully simplifying.
