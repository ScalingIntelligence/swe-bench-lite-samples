Specifically, the '_eval_refine' method in the Pow class deals with refining the evaluation based on certain assumptions, which could be relevant for simplifying expressions involving powers. The 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' file contains the main 'simplify' function which orchestrates the simplification process, incorporating various simplification techniques including power simplification and trigonometric simplification.
