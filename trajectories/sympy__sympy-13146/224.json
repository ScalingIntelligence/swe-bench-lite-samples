Specifically, functions like `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and `radsimp` are potentially relevant as they deal with various aspects of simplification involving powers and radicals. Additionally, the `evalf_pow` function in 'sympy/core/evalf.py' is also relevant as it deals with the numerical evaluation of powers, which might be necessary to verify the simplification. The `simplify` function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' is a general-purpose simplification function that might be used as a wrapper for other specific simplification functions. Given these code spans, it's likely that `powsimp` or `simplify` could be used to address the user's issue, potentially in combination with other functions that handle specific aspects of power simplification.
