The example provided uses SymPy's `simplify` function and still doesn't fully simplify the expression. To resolve this, one should investigate the implementation of the `simplify` function and related functionalities like `powsimp` and `powdenest`. Additionally, the `evalf` function might also play a crucial role in evaluating the difference under floating-point precision. The provided context gives clues about which files to inspect to understand how simplification is handled in SymPy.",

The user wants to ensure that the expression simplifies to zero rather than showing terms that cancel each other out. The primary function of interest here is 'simplify', but in this context, it seems that 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' might be more relevant since they specifically deal with powers and their simplification/nesting. From the search results, various functions and spans related to power operations, simplification, and symbolic computation have been identified. These include 'powsimp', 'powdenest', and other functions/attributes within classes like 'Pow' that affect the evaluation of powers. Given the issue at hand, these spans are likely relevant since they deal directly with the manipulation of exponents and bases in symbolic expressions. The spans for 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' and their sub-functions within the context files (sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, sympy/core/power.py, sympy/simplify/simplify.py) are relevant because they contain code logic related to the simplification of powers and the multiplication of exponents, critical for the desired simplification to zero.",
