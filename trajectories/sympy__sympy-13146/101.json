The user is having trouble simplifying an expression where two terms with the same base and exponent are being subtracted, but the result is not simplifying to zero as expected. This issue may be related to how sympy handles exponent simplification at a fundamental level. It might involve specific functions or classes responsible for exponent operations in sympy. Relevant functions to look for could include those related to power simplification, expression simplification, and perhaps even specific handling of exponents in the mathematical operations within the library. Considering the files provided, focusing on code related to simplification, exponent operations, and handling of mathematical expressions could be useful.",
