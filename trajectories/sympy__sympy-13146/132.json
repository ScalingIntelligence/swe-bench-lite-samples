The provided code snippet and the output indicate that the expression `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` should ideally simplify to 0, but it is not doing so. This suggests that the functionality for simplifying such expressions might not be operating as expected within the SymPy library. To address this issue, the focus should be on identifying and reviewing the relevant code within the library responsible for exponent simplification, power base expansion, and expression simplification. Key files and functions to investigate include those dealing with power operations, expression simplification, and potentially specific simplification techniques like `powsimp` and `simplify`. The goal is to determine if there are flaws or missing configurations in these functionalities that prevent the expression from simplifying correctly.",

The relevant code spans are identified by examining the SymPy library for functions and classes that handle the simplification and power operations. In 'sympy/core/power.py', the Pow class and its methods are relevant as they manage power operations. Particularly, methods like _eval_refine, _eval_subs, and _eval_expand_power_base are closely related to the manipulation and simplification of powers. In 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', the simplify function and its components are relevant, as this function is directly involved in the simplification process. The function attempts to simplify an expression by trying different simplification methods. In 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', the powsimp function is important as it aims to combine and simplify powers within expressions. This function is called within other simplification functions and is vital for achieving the desired simplification of the user's expression. Lastly, in 'sympy/core/mul.py', the Mul class and its methods are also identified as relevant because they handle multiplication, which is a fundamental operation in the expression provided by the user. Specifically, _eval_power and _eval_subs are highlighted as they directly affect how powers and substitutions are managed in Mul expressions. These code spans are chosen as they form the core functionalities of SymPy that would need to be inspected or possibly modified to resolve the simplification issue.",
