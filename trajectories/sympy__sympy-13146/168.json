The search results contain code spans from the `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` files, which are relevant to handling powers and simplification. Particularly, the '_eval_power' methods in the 'Float', 'Rational', and 'Integer' classes, along with the 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' functions, are key to understanding how SymPy handles exponentiation and simplification of expressions involving powers. These methods and functions could potentially contain the logic or approach to enforce full simplification as needed by the user.
