The reported issue involves expressions with fractional exponents that Sympy fails to simplify fully, resulting in non-zero residual terms. I will focus on code spans within the sympy.core.power module that handle exponentiation (class Pow) and simplification (`__new__`, `_eval_power`, `_eval_refine`, `as_numer_denom`). These methods are critical for understanding and altering the behavior of exponentiation and simplification in Sympy. By examining these spans, we can pinpoint where additional logic might be required to handle the specific case of simplifying expressions involving fractional exponents more effectively. This includes checking for and simplifying cases where expressions should theoretically cancel out to zero but do not due to inherent limitations in the current simplification algorithms.",
