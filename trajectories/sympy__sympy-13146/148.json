Given the issue, focusing on the `simplify`, `powsimp`, and `powdenest` functions in the simplification module seems pertinent. Additionally, understanding how `_eval_power` in the `Pow` class and `Number` classes (specifically `Float`, `Rational`, and `Integer`) handle exponentiation is crucial. Other related functions like `evalf` for numerical evaluation might also be worth exploring if they influence the simplification process. The `is_constant` method in the `Pow` class could also be relevant to check if an expression is the constant 0.",

The `Float` and `Rational` classes in `sympy.core.numbers` also demonstrate how numerical types evaluate powers and interact with Float and Rational types. The `simplify` function in `sympy.simplify.simplify` employs various strategies including `powsimp` for simplifying powers in expressions.
