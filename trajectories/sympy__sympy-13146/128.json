The search results provide insights into both the simplify function and the Pow class. The simplify function definition in sympy/simplify/simplify.py includes handling of various types of expressions and their simplification. The Pow class in sympy/core/power.py defines the behavior of exponentiation and includes methods for evaluation and simplification of power expressions. Both these sections of code are likely relevant to addressing the reported issue. Specifically, the simplify function's handling of complex expressions and the Pow class's methods for evaluating and simplifying powers are areas to focus on.
