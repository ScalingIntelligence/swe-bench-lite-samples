From the search results, we identify the following key functions and classes that could be relevant:\n\n1. `powsimp`: This function is used to combine powers with similar bases and exponents. It could be used to simplify the expression by combining like terms.\n2. `powdenest`: This function attempts to simplify nested powers. Since the issue involves nested powers, this function might be useful.\n3. `Mul._eval_power`: This method is responsible for handling exponentiation in multiplication. It's crucial for understanding how exponentiation is handled within Mul objects.\n4. `Pow.__new__`: This is the constructor for the Pow class, which is responsible for creating power expressions. It likely includes logic for simplifying powers.\n\nBy focusing on these parts of the code, we can identify the relevant code spans that directly relate to the reported issue.
