Reviewing the provided code and search results, it is evident that the issue revolves around the 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' functions in SymPy, which are designed to handle simplification of powers. The 'powsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' and 'powdenest' within the same file are directly applicable to handling exponentiation simplification tasks as described in the issue. They contain logic for simplifying expressions involving exponents which is highly relevant to the user's problem. Additionally, methods in the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py', such as '_eval_simplify', '_eval_subs', and 'powdenest' within 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', provide further context and functionality for dealing with powers and their simplifications. These functions and methods are likely places in the codebase where the necessary adjustments and enhancements to address the reported issue can be made.",
