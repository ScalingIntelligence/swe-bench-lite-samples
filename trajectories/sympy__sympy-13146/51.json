The provided code snippets and file names suggest that the logic for exponent simplification might be spread across multiple files. The core functionalities like expression handling, number evaluation, and simplification functions are distributed across several files including 'sympy/core/expr.py', 'sympy/core/numbers.py', 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and others. The search should focus on these files and specific functions or classes that handle exponent simplification and numerical evaluation to identify where the simplification might be failing.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the inability of the SymPy library to fully simplify an expression involving fractional powers of a variable. The user provides an example where two seemingly equivalent expressions, differing only in representation, do not simplify to zero when subtracted from each other. \n\nTo address this, it's crucial to identify parts of the codebase responsible for handling the simplification of powers and expressions. The search results provide several relevant files and spans of code: \n\n1. `sympy/core/power.py` - This file contains the `Pow` class, which is likely responsible for handling the core functionality of powers in SymPy. Relevant spans include `Pow._eval_subs`, `Pow._eval_expand_power_base`, and `Pow._eval_derivative`. \n\n2. `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - This file contains functions specifically designed for simplifying powers, such as `powsimp` and `powdenest`. These functions are likely the entry points for any simplification involving powers. \n\n3. `sympy/core/numbers.py` - This file contains implementations for various types of numbers, including `Integer`, `Rational`, and `Float`. Relevant spans include `Float._eval_power` and `Rational._eval_power`, which handle exponentiation for these number types. \n\n4. `sympy/core/mul.py` - This file contains the `Mul` class, which plays a significant role in handling multiplication and its properties, including powers. Relevant spans include `Mul._eval_power`. \n\n5. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - This file contains the `simplify` function, which is the general-purpose simplification function in SymPy. Although it's a broad entry point for simplification, it's worth noting for context. \n\nGiven these findings, the most relevant code spans are likely those in `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, as they directly involve the simplification of powers and expressions involving powers. These spans will be marked as relevant to the reported issue.",
