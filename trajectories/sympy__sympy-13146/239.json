The search results include various files and spans of code that pertain to simplification functions within the SymPy library. The relevant spans include implementations of the `simplify` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, as well as other related simplification methods. These spans provide an overview of how SymPy handles simplification and might offer insights into why the given expression might not simplify to 0. Given the spans provided, it seems there is enough context to theoretically address the reported issue, though actual code implementations in the search results do not directly point to a solution for the user's specific query. However, by understanding the overall structure and function of SymPy's simplification routines provided in the search results and the context of specific files and function implementations, one could potentially guide the user on where to look or what setup to change in their own script to achieve the requested simplification.",
