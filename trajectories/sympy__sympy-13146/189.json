The `powsimp` function is found in the 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' file, which contains logic for simplifying expressions involving powers. Similarly, the `simplify` function is found in the 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' file, which is responsible for more generalized simplification techniques. Both functions are involved in the process of simplifying expressions and are likely to contain the necessary code to address the reported issue.
