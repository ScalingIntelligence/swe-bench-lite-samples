These files contain methods for simplifying powers (`powsimp`), evaluating powers (`_eval_power` in `Pow` class), and handling non-commutative parts of the product in `Mul` class.\n\nThe `powsimp` function in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py is particularly relevant as it combines bases under suitable conditions, which could potentially simplify the expression to 0 if the conditions are met. The `_eval_power` method in sympy/core/power.py and sympy/core/mul.py are also relevant as they handle the exponentiation of expressions, which is a key part of the user's issue.\n\nFurthemore, the sympy/simplify/simplify.py file contains the `simplify` function which is a general-purpose simplification function and could potentially address the user's issue by simplifying the expression further after using `powsimp`.

The `powsimp` function and the `simplify` function are the primary areas to check for relevant code. The provided context includes detailed implementations of these functions, which are intricately involved in the power simplification process. Specifically, the `powsimp` function's logic for combining exponents and the `simplify` function's use of `powsimp` are directly related to the issue at hand. Further, the handling of powers in the `power.py` module, particularly in the `_eval_power` method of the `Pow` class, is also contextually relevant as it deals with the exponentiation logic. Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in the `mul.py` module addresses the power manipulations in multiplication scenarios. Overall, the file context adequately covers the codebases involved in addressing the reported exponent simplification issue without needing additional search, making the identification of relevant code complete.",
