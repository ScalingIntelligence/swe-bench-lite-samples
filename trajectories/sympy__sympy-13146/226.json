The key elements to look for in the codebase are functions and classes related to exponent simplification, such as `powsimp`, `Pow`, and related methods. Additionally, it's important to identify the methods within the `Pow` class that handle the simplification and evaluation of exponentiation, and functions like `expand_mul` that might be used in this process. Given the structure of the SymPy codebase, we are looking for specific methods within the `Pow` class such as `_eval_expand_power_exp`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, `_eval_subs`, etc., and the `powsimp` function itself. These functions will likely include logic for combining and simplifying powers, which is relevant to the reported issue. The search results provided include various methods from the `Pow` class and the `powsimp` function, which are all likely candidates for addressing the reported issue.",
