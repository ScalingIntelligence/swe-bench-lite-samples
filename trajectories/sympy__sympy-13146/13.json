The goal is to ensure that expressions like `expr1 - expr2` are fully simplified to zero. Given the nature of the problem, it's likely that the relevant code lies within the SymPy modules handling expression simplification, particularly those dealing with powers and exponents. Identifying the specific methods and functions that handle the simplification of powers, such as `powsimp` and `simplify`, will be crucial.",

The key functions to look for would be those that simplify, combine, or denest powers. Given the issue, it's evident that the original simplification function used, `simplify()`, isn't achieving the desired result, so a more specialized function for handling power expressions is likely needed. The search results show several functions that could be relevant: `powsimp()`, `powdenest()`, and `_denest_pow()` are the primary candidates to investigate further since they are explicitly designed to work with powers and exponent manipulations. These are found in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`. The `Pow()` class in `sympy/core/power.py` could also be relevant since it defines the behavior of the `Pow` object which includes its properties related to bases and exponents. Digging deeper into these specific areas should provide relevant code spans that handle detailed power simplification or that offer hints into a better way to handle the issue.",
