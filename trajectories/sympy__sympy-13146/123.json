The relevant classes and functions to investigate include `Pow`, `Rational`, and the specific simplification functions like `simplify`, `powsimp`, and `powdenest`. Additionally, the `evalf` function used in the code may be a point of interest for understanding the float representation of the expression.",

The key part of the issue is the simplification of the expression `res = expr1 - expr2`, where both `expr1` and `expr2` are similar but not identical expressions involving powers and fractions. Looking through the search results, the relevant code spans are found in sympy/simplify/simplify.py and sympy/core/power.py which deal with the `simplify` function and the `Pow` class respectively. The `simplify` function's role is crucial as it is responsible for trying to reduce the complexity of mathematical expressions, and the `Pow` class handles operations related to powers. From the search results, the 'simplify' span in sympy/simplify/simplify.py and the 'Pow' span in sympy/core/power.py are identified as the most relevant to the reported issue due to their direct handling of complex expressions and powers respectively. These spans provide the necessary context and code for deeper analysis and potential fixes related to the simplification task at hand. The analysis is now complete based on the provided search results and the requirement to identify the relevant code spans and files to address the reported issue.",

The issue suggests that the `simplify` function does not fully simplify the given expression, which aligns with the content of the provided file context. Additionally, the context includes `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and other related functions that indicate a focus on power simplification.
