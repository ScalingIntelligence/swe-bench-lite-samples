The issue involves using SymPy's simplification functions effectively to handle expressions with fractional and real exponents. We first need to look at the 'simplify' function which is a high-level function that attempts to apply various simplification methods. Within the 'simplify' function, it can call other specialized simplification functions such as 'powsimp' for simplifying powers, 'radsimp' for simplifying expressions with radicals, and potentially 'signsimp' for handling sign normalization. Given the exponent expression involves fractions and real numbers, 'powsimp' and 'radsimp' are particularly relevant as they handle simplification of powers and radicals. Additionally, since the expression needs to be simplified to zero, functions that handle terms cancellation and arithmetic simplification within 'simplify' are also important. We find these functions within the search results in files like 'simplify/simplify.py', 'simplify/powsimp.py', and 'simplify/radsimp.py'. The 'powsimp' function is particularly relevant as it attempts to combine and simplify powers, which directly applies to the exponent in the reported issue. Moreover, 'radsimp' can act on expressions involving radicals, which might be implicitly involved in terms with fractional exponents. Therefore, these functions and their implementations, as well as the high-level 'simplify' function, are key to addressing the reported issue of simplifying exponent expressions in SymPy.",
