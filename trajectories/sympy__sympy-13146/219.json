The user wants the expression to simplify to 0 rather than showing two equal terms with opposite signs. The relevant functions and classes seem to be 'simplify' from sympy.simplify.simplify and 'Pow' from sympy.core.power. Additional relevant functions might include 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' from sympy.simplify.powsimp since they handle powers and simplification. Also, 'evalf' from sympy.core.evalf could be relevant for numerical evaluation, which is mentioned in the code snippet. Focusing the search on these functions and classes will likely yield the code necessary to understand and resolve the issue.",

This involves understanding how the `simplify` function in SymPy works and whether there are any specific methods or classes that handle power simplifications.\n\nFrom the search results, several relevant files and spans of code are identified:\n\n1. `sympy/core/expr.py` - This file contains the `Expr` class which has a `simplify` method.\n2. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - This file contains the `simplify` function which is called by the `simplify` method in the `Expr` class.\n3. `sympy/core/power.py` - This file contains the `Pow` class which is relevant for handling power expressions.\n4. `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - This file contains the `powsimp` function which is used to simplify expressions involving powers.\n\nThese files and their respective code spans are likely relevant to addressing the reported issue, as they deal with the core functionality of simplifying symbolic expressions, including those involving powers. The `simplify` function and the `simplify` method in the `Expr` class are crucial for understanding how general simplification works, while the `Pow` class and `powsimp` function are specifically tailored for simplifying power expressions, which are central to the reported issue.\n\nGiven these identified code spans and their relevance to the issue, I will proceed to mark the identified spans as relevant.",
