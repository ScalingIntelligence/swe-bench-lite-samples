Additionally, the 'Mul' class handles the multiplication of expressions, and the 'Pow' class defines the power operation. Although the specific code snippet mentioned in the issue (e.g., `S(1)/2*x**2.5`) is not directly provided, the functions and methods present in the file context suggest that they would be used to address the issue.
