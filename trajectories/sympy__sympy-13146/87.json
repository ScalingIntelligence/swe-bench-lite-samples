Initially, the issue appears to involve comparing different representations of the same expression and ensuring they simplify correctly to zero. The provided search results include several relevant sections from the SymPy codebase that handle simplification and power operations.\n\nIn 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', the `simplify` function scopes operations like cancel, together, factor, and trigonometric, exponential, and combinatorial simplifications. This function appears to be a central point for general simplification tasks.\n\nIn 'sympy/core/power.py', the `Pow` class handles basic power operations, with methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_power_base` focusing on exponentiation, substitution, and expanding the base of powers, which are likely necessary for ensuring the expression `res` simplifies to zero.\n\nLastly, 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' contains functions like `powsimp` and `powdenest` that are dedicated to simplifying and organizing powers, ensuring they are combined and nested correctly. These are critical for handling expression cases like the one in the issue where powers with different representations need to be simplified to a common form.\n\nBased on the issue specifics, these spans from the search results are relevant as they handle cases inherent to the problem: ensuring powers simplify correctly, facilitating operations through substitution and expansion of bases, and managing the simplification of nests and combinations of powers.\n\nThus, collecting these code spans will help understand and possibly address the reported issue, providing insight into how SymPy handles simplification of expressions involving powers specifically.",

Also, update the _eval_power method in 'power.py' to handle the evaluation of powers with rational exponents more effectively, ensuring that the simplification of terms like `1/2*x**2.5 - 1*x**(5/2)/2` results in `0` rather than `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`.
