Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the problem lies within the simplification logic or the handling of power expressions in SymPy. This could involve the 'simplify', 'powsimp', or 'Pow' functions and their parameters. Therefore, focusing on these functions in the SymPy core and simplify modules would be the most efficient approach to find where the simplification might be failing. Also, considering the 'eval' and 'evalf' functions could be relevant since they deal with evaluation and floating-point precision, which might affect how the expression is processed for simplification.",

The main key function to look for is `powsimp`, which is designed to simplify powers in expressions. Additionally, the classes and methods related to handling `Pow` (power) expressions, such as `Pow.__new__`, `Pow.base`, and `Pow.exp`, are crucial as they define how powers are created and manipulated. Furthermore, understanding how the `evalf` and `simplify` functions influence the numerical evaluation and simplification process will be important to fully grasp how the system might be failing to simplify the expression effectively. Overall, my analysis will center around the `powsimp` function and interactions with `Pow` objects within SymPy.",
