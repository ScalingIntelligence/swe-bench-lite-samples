This could be due to how the power operations are handled or specific rules around combining powers. The sympy library's simplify function seems to be insufficient in this case, indicating a deeper issue within the power simplification logic. Key functions and classes to focus on are 'powsimp', 'powdenest', 'Pow', and '_eval_power' which are likely to manipulate and simplify power expressions. Given the identified files, the focus should be on the core power operations and the simplify functions related to powers.",

Specifically, the user wants to simplify the expression `expr1 - expr2` to 0, where both `expr1` and `expr2` are slightly different expressions involving `x` raised to the power of 2.5. The search results reveal several relevant functions and classes in the sympy codebase that could be useful for addressing this issue. These include `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and the `Pow` class with its various methods. `powsimp` is a function that simplifies expressions by combining exponents, which could potentially help in combining the terms in the expression. `powdenest` removes nested powers, which might be useful if the expression contains nested powers. The `Pow` class and its methods such as `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_power_base` deal with the evaluation and simplification of powers, which could be directly relevant to handling the user's issue. Overall, these functions and classes appear to be relevant to the task of simplifying the expression as described in the reported issue.",
