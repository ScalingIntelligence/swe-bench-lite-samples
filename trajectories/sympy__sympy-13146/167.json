The expression remains in a form where visually the terms cancel each other out, but SymPy does not reduce it to zero. This suggests that the simplification logic might not handle fractional exponents or specific combinations of them effectively. The relevant files identified so far are those related to the core mathematics and simplification logic in SymPy, including `expr.py`, `numbers.py`, `simplify.py`, and `power.py`. To further investigate, we should focus on functions and methods that handle exponent simplification and evaluation, particularly looking at `Pow`, `simplify`, `evalf`, and related simplification methods.",

The user's code involves creating and simplifying symbolic expressions using the `sympy.simplify` function, but the expression doesn't simplify to zero as the user expects. Analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `Pow` class, particularly in methods like `_eval_power` and `_eval_subs`, which handle the evaluation and substitution of powers. These methods are critical for understanding and manipulating expressions involving powers, which aligns with the user's request for better simplification. The `_eval_power` method is especially relevant as it deals with the evaluation of expressions when raising to a power, which is a key step in the simplification process. Therefore, these sections of code are directly related to the issue of expression simplification within the sympy library.",
