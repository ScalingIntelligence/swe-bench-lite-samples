I reviewed the <search_results> to find code related to SymPy's simplification utilities, focusing especially on `powsimp` and `simplify` functions as they directly address exponent simplification and general simplification tasks respectively. In the provided code from `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `powsimp` function is used for simplifying powers in expressions and handling various cases including non-commutative parts, which aligns with what might be needed for the user's reported issue. The `simplify` function from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is a more comprehensive simplification tool also likely relevant, particularly as it internally uses `powsimp`. These findings suggest both `powsimp` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` and `simplify` in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` are likely relevant and should be included in the response as they address potential issues with not fully simplifying exponents and expressions.",
