This suggests a need for a deeper simplification that SymPy's `simplify` function might not provide out of the box. The relevant sections of the codebase to look at would be those handling power simplifications and general simplifications, as these are likely to impact the ability to collapse these terms. Specifically, the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` and the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` are relevant. The former is designed to simplify expressions with powers in various ways, and the latter should theoretically handle the deeper simplification if all other simplification methods fail. Additionally, the `Expr.simplify` and `Expr.powsimp` methods in `sympy/core/expr.py` are used to apply these simplification techniques.",
