The focus in these files is on methods that manipulate or analyze exponents, which directly address the issue of simplifying exponent expressions to zero. For example, the `powsimp` module contains the `powsimp` function that simplifies powers and bases, while the `simplify` module integrates various simplification techniques including those from `trigsimp`, `exp_simp`, and `combsimp` to enhance the simplification process.

The modifications should focus on the internal simplification logic that evaluates and combines exponent terms. This involves updating the logic around lines 554-572, which include various simplification strategies, including handling trigonometric functions and logarithms. Specific attention should be given to the `powsimp` and `logcombine` calls, potentially adding new logic to intelligently reduce fractional exponents.",
