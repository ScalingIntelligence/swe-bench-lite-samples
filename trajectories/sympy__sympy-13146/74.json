The user's code demonstrates an example where the result of the subtraction of two equivalent expressions involving powers of 'x' is not simplified to zero as expected. Instead, it remains as a subtraction of two identical terms. The user is seeking a solution to ensure the expression simplifies to zero. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to how the `simplify` function or the underlying power simplification logic in `sympy` works. Therefore, the search should focus on the `simplify` function itself and related power simplification modules in `sympy`.",

This suggests that the simplification functions within SymPy may not be handling the exponentiation component as expected. Given this, the focus should be on the powsimp and simplify functions within SymPy. The search results include several relevant parts of the codebase, specifically in the sympy/simplify/powsimp.py and sympy/simplify/simplify.py files. These files contain the definitions of the powsimp and simplify functions, which are the primary tools used for simplifying expressions. In this context, looking at the code spans identified within these files is crucial for understanding how expressions are simplified and whether they can address the user's issue with exponent simplification. The 'powsimp' function in the powsimp.py file is particularly relevant, as it is designed to combine and simplify powers and exponentials in expressions. The 'simplify' function in the simplify.py file also calls the 'powsimp' function internally, providing additional context on how general simplifications are handled.",
