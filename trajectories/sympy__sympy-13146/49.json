In the provided search results, several potential solutions are evident through the methods within the `Expr` class and other related functions. The `simplify` method directly addresses the need for expression simplification, and other methods such as `equals`, `_eval_as_leading_term`, and `nsimplify` could potentially provide further simplification or comparison logic. However, the provided `simplify` function may not be sufficient on its own for complex simplifications. Additionally, `powsimp` in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' can handle power simplifications differently, which might help in achieving the desired simplification if the issue involves exponent manipulation. Multiple code spans in the `Expr` class (specifically `as_leading_term`, `simplify`, `_eval_as_leading_term`, `equals`, and `nsimplify`) are identified as relevant due to their direct relevance to simplifying expressions and identifying equality in a more nuanced way than just numerical comparison. The `powsimp` function in the other file also offers a way to handle simplification specifically with powers, potentially relevant for the reported issue where exponents don't fully simplify.",
