To address this, we should focus on the simplification functions and methods related to powers and exponents within SymPy. Specifically, we should look at methods and functions that handle exponent simplification and power operations. This includes examining classes like `Pow` and functions like `simplify`, `powsimp`, and `powdenest`.
