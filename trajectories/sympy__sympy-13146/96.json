Even though the lint errors mentioned in the chat pertain to missing arguments 'b' and 'e', it's actually the incorrect detection of lint errors. Given the provided file context, it's evident that these arguments are correctly handled in the '_eval_power' method of the 'Pow' class. Moreover, the detailed file context added here doesn't show a straightforward solution to the original 'powsimplify' issue. Therefore, this would suggest tackling the core issue (fully simplifying the fractional powers in the situation described in the issue) whereas the 'b' and 'e' arguments just marginally contribute to this issue resolution as they are not missing or incorrectly defined as initially suggested by the lint errors.",
