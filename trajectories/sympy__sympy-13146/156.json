Specifically, the expression `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` is expected to simplify to 0, but it remains unsimplified. The provided file context includes several SymPy files that are likely relevant to the issue: 'powsimp.py', 'power.py', and 'simplify.py'. These files handle various aspects of exponent simplification, power operations, and general simplification within SymPy. Notably, 'powsimp.py' contains the `powsimp` function, which is designed to simplify powers in expressions, and 'simplify.py' contains the `simplify` function, which applies various simplification techniques to an expression. The 'power.py' file contains the `Pow` class, which defines behavior for exponentiation in SymPy. Given these contexts, it is plausible that the issue lies within the logic of these functions or possibly how they interact with each other during the simplification process. The presence of these files and their content allows for a reasonable assumption that the relevant code areas have been identified, indicating that the file context is potentially complete for addressing the issue.",
