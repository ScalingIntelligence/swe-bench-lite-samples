The expression should simplify to zero but does not, due to potential issues in the simplification logic.

I will search specifically in files related to simplification (`simplify/`), core expression operations (`core/`), and handling power operations (`core/power.py`).",

The user wants to transform an expression like 'expr1 - expr2' into 0 using simplification. Key elements include using 'simplify' from sympy to transform a given expression with exponents. I then examined the code spans in the search results that involve 'simplify' functions, specifically looking at 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' where 'simplify' is defined. This function's internals could provide insight into the logic that handles expression simplification, including handling of exponents. Furthermore, I checked 'sympy/core/power.py' for definitions related to 'Pow', which could include specific handling of exponentiation that might be relevant. I also briefly glanced at 'sympy/core/expr.py' for additional functions like 'simplify' defined on the 'Expr' class, which might further detail sympy's simplification process. Based on these analyses, the identified code spans should include 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' and 'sympy/core/power.py'.",
