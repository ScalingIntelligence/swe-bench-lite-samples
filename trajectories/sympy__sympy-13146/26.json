Steps to approach this task include understanding the Pow class and its methods in `sympy/core/power.py`, examining the `_eval_power` methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py` for how powers are evaluated, and reviewing the main simplify function and related simplification methods in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. Additionally, understanding how the `simplify` function interacts with other simplification methods like `radsimp`, `powsimp`, and `powdenest` in their respective files might provide insights into why the expression isn't simplifying as expected.",

The user is seeking to understand why an expression is not simplifying to zero as expected. The analysis of the search results broadly covers various parts of the codebase related to number handling, power operations, and the simplification functions. Specifically, the code spans identified include implementations of power evaluation for different numeric types, simplification functions, and parts of the 'Pow' class which is likely involved in the exponentiation operations. These sections are highly relevant as they describe how expressions containing powers are handled and simplified within the library. The relevance of each span is assessed based on whether it provides insights or implementations of power manipulation and simplification that would be pertinent to the user's issue, such as the '_eval_power' methods across various numeric classes and the 'simplify' function itself.",
