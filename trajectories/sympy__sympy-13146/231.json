The user's example demonstrates a scenario where two expressions, which are mathematically equivalent, do not simplify to 0. I identified three key areas in the search results that are relevant to addressing this issue: \n1. The `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` that is used to simplify powers in expressions, which is potentially relevant for simplifying the exponents in the user's expression.\n2. The `simplify` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` that is designed to apply various simplification techniques, including `powsimp`, which indicates that a general simplification routine is in place that could address the issue.\n3. The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, which iterates through various simplification techniques, including `powsimp`, to try and simplify an expression. This is crucial as it offers a general approach to simplifying expressions that could potentially lead to solving the user's issue.\nGiven these findings, it appears that the codebase already contains the necessary tools to attempt resolving the simplification issue reported by the user. By leveraging the `powsimp` function in combination with the broader `simplify` function or method, the goal is to ensure that expressions do simplify properly, even when they contain complex or fractional exponents and coefficients. These identified sections of the code should allow for a deeper dive into how SymPy handles such expressions and potentially allow for adjustments if further simplification is required.",
