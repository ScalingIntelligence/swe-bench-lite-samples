The issue is about the inability to simplify an expression to 0 after subtracting two equivalent expressions. We focus on how SymPy handles exponentiation and simplification. The key files and functions to look for are those involved in simplifying expressions, handling power operations, and managing symbolic manipulations. This includes functions like `powsimp`, `simplify`, and methods of classes like `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, and their respective `_eval_power` methods. Additionally, we check for any special handling of exponents, bases, and their combinations to ensure complete simplification.

The files `mul.py`, `power.py`, and `expr.py` are also relevant as they cover different aspects of power operations and expression handling. The `simplify` function in `simplify.py` is a broader function that calls upon other specific simplification techniques, making it relevant to the issue.
