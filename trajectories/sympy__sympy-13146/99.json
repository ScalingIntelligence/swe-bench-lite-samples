The user is encountering an issue where the expression '-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5' is not simplifying to 0 as expected. This suggests that the simplification function provided by SymPy might not be handling certain types of expressions effectively. The task is to identify the relevant code spans responsible for the simplification functionality in the SymPy codebase. A thorough analysis of the provided search results reveals several key areas within the SymPy codebase that deal with simplification: \n\n1. **sympy/core/expr.py**: This file contains the `Expr` class which includes the `simplify` method. While this method references the global `simplify` function, it does not contain the actual implementation of simplification logic.\n\n2. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: This is the main file where the global `simplify` function is defined. It includes logic for simplifying expressions and references various simplification techniques such as 'trigsimp', 'powsimp', and others. Since the issue involves exponent simplification, this file is crucial.\n\n3. **sympy/simplify/powsimp.py**: This file contains the `powsimp` function which is responsible for simplifying powers and exponents. Since the user's issue involves exponent expressions not simplifying fully, this file is relevant.\n\n4. **sympy/core/power.py**: This file contains the `Pow` class, which defines the behavior of power operations in SymPy. Understanding how powers are handled is essential for debugging the simplification issue.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the most relevant and necessary code spans to understand and potentially resolve the exponent simplification issue are located in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' and 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py'.",
