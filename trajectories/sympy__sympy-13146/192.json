The provided code attempts to simplify an expression involving a symbolic variable 'x' raised to a fractional power.

I then processed the new search results focusing on relevant file paths such as 'sympy/core' and 'sympy/simplify' as they contain classes and functions related to expression manipulation and simplification. I identified relevant spans such as 'Pow', 'Expr.simplify', 'Expr.powsimp', and 'simplify' in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' which are directly related to handling powers and simplifying expressions. These are the most relevant code spans as they include functionality needed to implement or improve the simplification process, matching the key requirements of the reported issue.
