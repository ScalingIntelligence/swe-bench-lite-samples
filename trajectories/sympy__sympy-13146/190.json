The provided search results contain several relevant code spans: 1. The 'Pow' class definition which is central to handling powers. 2. 'Pow._eval_power' method, which evaluates powers and is critical for simplifying expressions like the user's. 3. 'Pow._eval_subs' method, which handles substitution, could be relevant if simplification involves replacing sub-expressions. 4.
