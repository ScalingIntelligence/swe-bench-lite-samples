Specifically, the user is trying to simplify an expression involving x**2.5 but is getting an output that is not completely simplified to zero. This suggests that the simplification functions might not be handling the fractional exponents as expected. The relevant files and functions to investigate could be those involved in exponent simplification and algebraic manipulation, such as powsimp, powdenest, simplify, and the '_eval_power' methods in classes like Expr, Pow, and Mul. The goal is to find where the simplification logic might fail to reduce the expression to zero as expected.",
