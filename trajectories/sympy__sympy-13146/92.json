The example provided uses SymPy's `simplify` function, but the output still shows the expression as two terms with opposite signs. To address this, we need to look at the `simplify` function in the SymPy codebase and related parts that handle exponentiation and simplification of expressions. The search results include several relevant spans: 'simplify' in sympy/simplify/simplify.py, 'Pow' and its related methods in sympy/core/power.py, and 'radsimp' in sympy/simplify/radsimp.py. These spans are relevant because they involve the core operations of simplifying expressions and handling powers. The 'simplify' function is particularly important as it encapsulates the process of simplifying expressions generally, which is the main issue in the reported problem. The 'Pow' class and its methods are relevant for understanding how exponentiation is handled in SymPy. 'radsimp' is also relevant as it involves the simplification of radicals, which could relate to the exponentiation issue. Given the nature of the reported issue and the provided search results, these spans should provide the necessary context to understand and potentially address the exponentiation simplification problem.",
