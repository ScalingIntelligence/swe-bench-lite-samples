The provided code example uses `sympy.simplify` but does not fully simplify the resulting expression to 0. From the search results, we can identify several key functions and methods in SymPy that might be relevant to address this issue: `powsimp` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, `simplify` in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `powsimp` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`. These functions and methods are designed to handle simplification of expressions, particularly with respect to powers and exponents. Specifically, `powsimp` is used to combine and simplify powers, while `simplify` is a more general simplification function. The context provided indicates that `powsimp` involves detailed logic for combining exponents, which might be crucial for the issue at hand. Additionally, the `simplify` method within the `Expr` class might provide a broader approach to simplifying the expression. Reviewing these code spans can help in understanding how best to handle the exponent simplification issue raised.",
