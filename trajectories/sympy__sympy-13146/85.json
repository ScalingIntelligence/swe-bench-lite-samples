The files provided indicate that `sympy/core/power.py` contains the `Pow` class, which is likely where the evaluation and simplification of powers occur. Additionally, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` contains the `simplify` function itself. These two files are most relevant to the issue.

The search results include key methods from the Pow class that deal with exponentiation, like _eval_power, _eval_subs, and _eval_expand_power_base, which are likely places to look for issues related to simplification of powers. Additionally, the simplify function from the simplify module is also included, which is responsible for the overall simplification process. These methods should be carefully reviewed to identify if they are correctly handling the simplification of expressions involving exponents. The analysis should focus on whether these methods correctly identify and handle cases where expressions should simplify to zero, especially when exponents and coefficients are such that they should cancel each other out.",
