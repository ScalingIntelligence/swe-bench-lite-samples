The key elements in the issue are the use of Sympy's `simplify` function and the handling of expressions involving `x**(5/2)` and `x**2.5`. The search results provide several relevant code spans. These include: 1. The `simplify` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`, which is directly related to the simplification process. 2. The `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/mul.py`, which deals with powers and might be relevant to understanding how powers are handled in expressions. 3. The `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py`, which is also related to power handling and might contain the logic needed to address the issue of simplification.

The issue involves the simplification of symbolic expressions in SymPy, and the file context includes definitions and methods for `Expr`, `Mul`, and `Pow`, which are central to handling symbolic expressions. Specifically, methods like `simplify`, `powsimp`, and `_eval_power` are present, which are directly related to the types of simplifications and power operations needed to address the issue. Additionally, the file context includes handling for symbolic comparisons and numerical evaluations, which could interplay with simplification processes. Given the comprehensive coverage of these methods and classes, I believe the file context is relevant and provides a sufficient basis to understand and potentially address the reported issue.",
