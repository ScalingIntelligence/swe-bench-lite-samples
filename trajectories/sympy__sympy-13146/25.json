Upon analysis of the provided code spans, several relevant functions and imports stand out: powsimp, powdenest, roots_quadratic, and simplify in various files such as sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, sympy/simplify/simplify.py, and sympy/polys/polyroots.py. These functions are directly involved in simplifying expressions and handling powers, which are central to resolving the user's issue. Furthermore, the Pow class and its methods in sympy/core/power.py also offer insights into how powers are evaluated and managed, which is pertinent to ensuring the expression simplifies correctly. The presence of these functions and classes indicates the complexity of the issues related to exponent simplification, demonstrating a need for sophisticated algorithms to handle such cases effectively.",
