The provided code uses symbols and expressions with fractional exponents. The error or unexpected behavior occurs during the simplification process, specifically with the 'simplify' function. Given the context and the nature of the issue, focusing on the 'simplify' function and related methods within the 'sympy.simplify' module is crucial. Additionally, examining classes like 'Pow' and methods that handle exponentiation in the 'sympy.core.power' module could provide insights into why the exponents are not simplifying as expected. Therefore, a search should target these specific areas to identify any code related to the handling of exponents or simplification that might need adjustment or enhancement to achieve the desired outcome.",
