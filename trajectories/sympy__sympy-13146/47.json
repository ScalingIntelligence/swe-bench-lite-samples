The primary functions in SymPy that deal with exponent simplification are 'Pow' from 'sympy.core.power', 'simplify' from 'sympy.simplify.simplify', and 'powsimp' from 'sympy.simplify.powsimp'. Each of these functions plays a crucial role in handling different aspects of exponent simplification. \n\n1. 'Pow' function defines the behavior of power operations and is essential for any manipulation of exponents.\n2. 'simplify' function provides a general-purpose simplification routine that includes optimizing expressions involving exponents.\n3. 'powsimp' function specifically targets the simplification of expressions with exponents by combining them where possible.\n\nGiven the specific requirements of the reported issue, it's evident that the 'simplify' function along with 'powsimp' are particularly relevant. The user's expression involves subtracting two exponent forms of 'x' and then trying to simplify the result to zero. The 'simplify' function in 'sympy.simplify.simplify' is the main entry point for general simplification that would likely include invoking 'powsimp' internally to handle exponent-related simplifications. Therefore, the focus should be on understanding and potentially modifying the 'simplify' function to better handle the specific case presented in the issue.",

The key focus is on understanding how the SymPy library handles the simplification process, particularly with expressions involving exponents. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that define how the simplify function and related operations like powsimp are implemented. These functions are crucial for understanding the behavior described in the issue, and they suggest that the code spans from files 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' and 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' are relevant. The spans labeled 'simplify' and 'powsimp' are directly related to the functions under question. Additionally, the code span 'Pow' from 'sympy/core/power.py' is also significant as it defines the behavior of the power operation, which is central to the issue. These code spans should provide sufficient context to understand and potentially debug the reported issue.",
