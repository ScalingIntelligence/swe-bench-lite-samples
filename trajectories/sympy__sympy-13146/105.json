To address this, reviewing the `simplify` function and associated helpers like `powsimp` and `powdenest` could be beneficial. Also, examining the implementation of the `Pow` class and its power evaluation methods might reveal insights into how to achieve full simplification. Thus, focusing on files related to expression simplification and exponent handling in SymPy is crucial for resolving this issue.",

Additionally, we should also consider the `Pow` class from `sympy.core.power` as it handles power operations, which are integral to the expression in question. From the search results, the relevant code spans include those defining the `simplify` method in `sympy.core.expr` and other modules like `sympy.simplify.simplify`, `sympy.simplify.powsimp`, and the `Pow` class in `sympy.core.power`.
