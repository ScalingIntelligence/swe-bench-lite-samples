These sections of the code are directly related to the manipulation and simplification of powers, which is key to addressing the user's issue. The `powsimp` function is used to combine and simplify powers, and `powdenest` is used to denest powers.

        "message": "The provided context files contain the implementation of the `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and `simplify` functions within the SymPy module. The `powsimp` function attempts to simplify expressions involving powers by combining bases and exponents according to algebraic rules, especially focusing on symbolic exponents that are fractions or involve arithmetic operations. The `powdenest` function targets expressions where powers are nested, efficiently simplifying such structures. The `simplify` function, on the other hand, orchestrates simplification across various domains, integrating functionalities from `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and other simplification tools. The issue at hand pertains specifically to the capability of these functions in handling symbolic exponents that might not conform to standard simplification rules. By examining these implementations, we can identify areas where additional handling for such specific cases might be necessary to ensure full simplification of expressions involving symbolic fractions as exponents.",
