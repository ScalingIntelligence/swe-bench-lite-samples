The goal is to ensure that the expression simplifies to zero. Given the nature of the issue, it is crucial to identify the parts of the codebase that deal with exponent simplification, evaluation of expressions, and the simplification of powers. The relevant files in the search results that seem pertinent to this issue are `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/evalf.py`, and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`. These files contain classes and methods like `Pow`, `evalf`, `powsimp`, and `powdenest`, which are likely to be involved in handling and simplifying powers and expressions.
