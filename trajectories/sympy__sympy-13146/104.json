Additionally, the powsimp function in the simplify module should also be reviewed as it is responsible for simplifying powers.

The goal is to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with power simplification and potentially suggest improvements or fixes. From the provided code, several key sections are relevant:\n1. `sympy/core/power.py`: Contains the `Pow` class and methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_refine`, and properties like `base` and `exp`, all dealing with operations related to powers.\n2. `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`: Contains the `powsimp` function which is designed to simplify expressions with powers, focusing on combining bases or exponents.\n3. `sympy/core/numbers.py`: Contains the `Integer` class which is likely involved in handling exponents, especially when they are integers.\nVisiting these parts of the code should provide insight into how SymPy simplifies power expressions and identify any issues in the current implementation. Additionally, examining how exponents and bases are handled in these contexts can guide potential fixes or improvements.",
