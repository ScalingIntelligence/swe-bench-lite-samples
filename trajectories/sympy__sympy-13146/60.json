Adjust the function for better handling of these scenarios by ensuring that operations aligning with exponent laws and relevant algebraic rules are rigorously applied during simplification.\n\nThe `powsimp` function needs modifications to better handle scenarios where exponents should cancel out or simplify properly. The focus areas are the combination of exponents with canceling bases, handling of negated bases, and rational exponents during combination.
