The relevant files identified so far suggest that the simplification process might not be fully resolving the differences due to the nature of the exponents and the expression structure. The focus should be on enhancing the simplify function or understanding why the current simplification step is not reducing the expression to 0. Searching for specific functions and methods within SymPy related to power simplification and expression evaluation should help in identifying the necessary code to address this issue.",
