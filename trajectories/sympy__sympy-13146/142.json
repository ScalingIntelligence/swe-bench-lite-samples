The user expects the result to be zero, but the expression remains as -0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5. The relevant functions to investigate might be those related to simplifying powers, such as 'powsimp', 'powdenest', or 'simplify'. Given the context, it might also be useful to check how floating-point numbers are handled in powers and how expressions are simplified in general. Specifying 'x' as a symbol and trying to simplify the expression indicates a need to look into the core Expr class, the Pow class, and the simplify functions.",

The provided code snippet and search results indicate that the relevant code spans are located in the `simplify` module and the `powsimp` module, which are responsible for simplification and handling of powers, respectively. Specifically, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` are key components handling expression simplification, including powers. Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py` is responsible for the evaluation and simplification of powers within the `Pow` class, which is crucial for the reported issue. The `Expr.simplify` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` is also identified as relevant since it calls the `simplify` function from the `simplify` module.",
