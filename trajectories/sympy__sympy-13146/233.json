The user's example demonstrates that the difference between two equivalent expressions results in a non-zero output. This suggests that the simplification process is not adequately handling the exponentiation or the subtraction of these terms.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, it is pertinent to understand how SymPy's simplification functions, particularly `simplify`, `powsimp`, and potentially `powdenest`, handle such expressions. The focus should be on the `simplify` function as it encapsulates and orchestrates different simplification techniques including `powsimp`, which is explicitly aimed at combining exponents. The code spans provided in the search results detail how these functions process expressions, which is crucial for addressing the user's issue.\n\nThe relevant code spans include:\n1. The `simplify` function definition, especially the part where it handles different types of expressions and calls nested simplification functions.\n2. The `powsimp` function, which specifically addresses simplification of powers and exponents, including combining them under certain conditions.\n3. The `powdenest` function, although not directly referenced by the user, is still significant as it denests powers, which can sometimes help in simplifying complex expressions where exponents contain other exponents.\n\nThese code spans collectively provide insight into how SymPy attempts to manage and simplify expressions, which is key for diagnosing and potentially resolving the issue the user is experiencing with exponent simplification.",
