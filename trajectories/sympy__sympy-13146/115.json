The user is looking to simplify `expr1 - expr2` to `0`, but the current output is `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`. This suggests that the simplification process in SymPy is not effectively cancelling out the terms. \n\nTo address this, we need to look into the relevant parts of the codebase that handle exponentiation and simplification. The `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` is a likely candidate, as it deals with exponentiation. Additionally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is responsible for simplifying expressions. Finally, the `Rational` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and the `Mul` class in `sympy/core/mul.py` might also be relevant, as they handle the multiplication and rational number operations respectively. \n\nThe spans `Pow`, `Pow.base`, `Pow.exp`, `Pow._eval_refine`, `Pow._eval_evalf`, `Pow._eval_is_rational`, `simplify`, and `Rational._eval_power` are particularly relevant as they deal directly with exponentiation and the simplification of powers. The `Mul._eval_power` span is also relevant as it handles the multiplication of powers. \n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans should help in understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the exponent simplification in SymPy.",
