Given the nature of the issue, both files are likely relevant. The 'sympy/core/power.py' file contains definitions and evaluations related to the 'Pow' class which deals with exponents. Notably, the '_eval_power', '_eval_subs', and '_eval_expand_power_base' methods might be relevant for evaluating and simplifying powers. The 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' file contains the 'simplify' function which is directly related to the task of simplifying expressions. This function is likely the main entry point for simplifying the expression in the reported issue. As such, it is critical to analyze and potentially modify this function to ensure proper simplification of expressions involving exponents and fractions. Therefore, both files and the methods within them should be considered relevant to the issue.
