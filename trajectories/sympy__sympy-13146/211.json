The relevant SymPy functions and classes to look into are those dealing with power simplification, expression evaluation, and perhaps more specifically, the `powsimp`, `simplify`, and `Pow` classes. It's also worth checking if there are custom simplification rules or settings that might influence how powers are handled in SymPy. Additionally, the `evalf` function might have an impact on numeric evaluation, which could be related to the simplified form not evaluating to zero as expected.",
