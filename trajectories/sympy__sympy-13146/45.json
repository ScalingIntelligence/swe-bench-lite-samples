The expression `res = expr1 - expr2` results in `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`, which should simplify to 0 but doesn't. This suggests that the simplify function might not be handling fractional exponents or floating-point powers correctly. Relevant functions to look at could be `simplify`, `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and `_eval_power` within the context of SymPy's core and simplify modules. Additionally, examining the `evalf` function in the `evalf` module might be useful to see how numerical evaluation is being handled.",
