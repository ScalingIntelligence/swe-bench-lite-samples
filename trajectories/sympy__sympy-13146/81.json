When subtracting these expressions, the result is not simplified to 0 as expected. The user wants to know how to simplify the result to 0.\n\nThe search results provide context in two files: 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' and 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py'. In 'simplify.py', the 'simplify' function is defined, which includes various steps to try to simplify an expression, including the use of 'powsimp', 'cancel', 'trigsimp', and others. This function is likely the main function the user would call to simplify their expression. In 'powsimp.py', the 'powsimp' function itself is defined, which is responsible for combining powers with similar bases and simplifying the expression.\n\nGiven these contexts, the relevant code spans can be identified in both files. In 'simplify.py', the 'simplify' function definition spans should be considered relevant as it is the core function handling simplification. In 'powsimp.py', both the 'powsimp' function and the 'powdenest' function definitions are relevant, as they directly deal with the simplification of powers, which is central to the issue at hand.",
