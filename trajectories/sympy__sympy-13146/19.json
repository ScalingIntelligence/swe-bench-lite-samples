This suggests that the simplification logic may need to be enhanced or adjusted. To address this, it would be beneficial to look into the `simplify` function itself and related modules such as `powsimp`, `radsimp`, and `fu` which handle different aspects of simplification. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy.core.power` might also be relevant as it deals with exponentiation.",

Processing new search results:\n   - In `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `powsimp` function is relevant as it simplifies powers. The `powdenest` function also appears to be related to simplifying nested powers.\n   - In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow` class and its methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_power_base` are likely relevant to the simplification of powers.\n   - In `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Integer` class and its `_eval_power` method are found, which is relevant as the exponent could be an integer.\n   - In `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, the `TR0` function and `_TR56` function are found, which might be relevant for simplifying trigonometric expressions, but are less directly related to the current issue.\n   - In `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`, the `radsimp` function is found, which simplifies radicals, but may not be directly relevant to the current issue.\n   - In `sympy/core/mul.py`, the `Mul` class and its `_eval_power` method are found, which are relevant as multiplications and powers are involved.\n   - In `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function and `_real_to_rational` function are found, which are generally useful for simplification.\n   - In `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, some trigonometric simplification functions are found, which might be useful if trigonometric expressions were involved, but are less directly related to the current issue.\n\n4. Identifying relevant code spans based on the reported issue:\n   - The `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is highly relevant.\n   - The `Pow` class and its methods in `sympy/core/power.py` are relevant.\n   - The `Integer` class and its `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/numbers.py` are relevant.\n   - The `Mul` class and its `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/mul.py` are relevant.\n   - The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is relevant for general simplification.\n\n5.
