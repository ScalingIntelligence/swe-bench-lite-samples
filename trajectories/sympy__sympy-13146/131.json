The issue involves ensuring that expressions like `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` simplify to `0`. This requires understanding how SymPy handles exponentiation and simplification.\n\nThe `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is central to this process. It covers the main logic for simplifying expressions, including handling different forms of expressions, combining terms, and using various simplification techniques. The `simplify` span includes checks for expression types, attempts to reduce them to simpler forms, and then factors out terms. It is essential for addressing the reported issue.\n\nAdditionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` is relevant, as it handles exponentiation. The `_eval_power` span within the `Pow` class deals with evaluating powers, which is crucial for correctly simplifying expressions involving exponents. The `_eval_subs` span is also relevant as it handles substitution within expressions, which might be used during the simplification process.\n\nLastly, the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` handle simplification of powers specifically. The `powsimp` function combines bases with their exponents in a canonical way, which is relevant to ensuring expressions simplify properly. The `powdenest` function is also relevant as it simplifies nested powers.\n\nAfter analyzing these spans, I conclude that the reported issue can be addressed using the functionality present across the identified spans, providing a comprehensive solution to the exponent simplification problem.",

Specifically, we need to adjust the method to better handle situations where the exponent values do not cleanly simplify using traditional integer division rules. We're looking to provide a more robust treatment that allows the script to autonomously decide on when to simplify exponents aplied to some base in a distributive manner circumstantially rather than merely straightforwardly.\n\nThe modification requires changes to the logic within the _eval_power method where it handles mixed type exponent combinations. Specifically, the part of the code that decides on simplification of exponents applied to some base needs adjustment to handle mixed types more robustly. This involves modifying the conditions and logic around lines 289 to 321 where the method currently processes real exponents.",
