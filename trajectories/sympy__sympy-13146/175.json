Specifically, we should focus on the `simplify` function and other related functions like `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and `nsimplify` that deal with exponents and complex expressions. The provided context from the files suggests that these functions are used to simplify expressions but might not be handling fractional exponents effectively in all cases. The goal is to ensure that when expressions are computed, they are simplified to the most basic form, which in this case should be zero for the given subtraction operation.",
