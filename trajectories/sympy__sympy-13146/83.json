The user wants the expression to simplify to zero but finds it simplifies only to a form that still shows the difference of two equal terms, which mathematically should be zero. The provided code snippet uses `expr1` and `expr2` which are equivalent but are not cancelling each other out properly. The user is specifically asking how to simplify the expression using SymPy to get the desired result of 0.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant sections seem to be within the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in the `sympy` package. The `powsimp` function is used to combine and simplify powers, which could be directly what the user needs. Also, the `powdenest` function is designed to denest powers according to their exponentiation properties. These functions could help in the simplification process of the user's expression.\n\nGiven the analysis, it seems that the search results directly address the user's issue. The `powsimp` function can potentially simplify the user's expression to the desired result of 0, as it specifically handles simplification of power expressions, which is exactly the issue at hand. Therefore, the identified code spans seem to be relevant to resolve the user's reported issue.",
