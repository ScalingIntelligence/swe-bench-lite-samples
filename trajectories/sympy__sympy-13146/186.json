The specific problem is that the expression '-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5' does not simplify to 0 as expected. This could be due to how SymPy handles floating-point exponents or the simplification logic for such expressions. Possible relevant areas include the `powsimp`, `simplify`, and `Pow` classes or functions within SymPy's core and simplify modules. Searching for these specific terms and classes could lead to relevant code snippets and logic that handle exponent simplification and evaluation.",

Additionally, the file `sympy/core/power.py` contains the `Pow` class, which is essential for handling exponentiation in SymPy. The `_eval_power` method within the `Pow` class is particularly relevant, as it deals with the evaluation of powers and could be involved in fixing the issue related to exponent simplification. The `powdenest` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` also appears relevant, as it further simplifies expressions involving powers, potentially addressing the reported issue.
