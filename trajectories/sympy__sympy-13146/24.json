The issue of 'expr1-expr2' not simplifying to zero despite having equal but opposite exponents is likely related to how SymPy handles exponent cancellation and simplification. The provided file context includes functions like powsimp, powdenest, and simplify which are key to addressing this type of issue.

The user provides an example where `expr1` and `expr2` are seemingly equivalent expressions, but their difference doesn't simplify to zero as expected. I should look for relevant code spans in the search results that address simplification functions, particularly those dealing with powers and expressions containing `sympy.simplify`.\n\nThe file_context provided includes files from the `sympy.simplify` module such as `powsimp.py`, `power.py`, and `simplify.py`, which contain functions like `powsimp`, `Pow`, and `simplify`. These are likely relevant to the issue.\n\nIn the new search results, I see files like `polytools.py`, `numberfields.py`, and `polyfuncs.py`. While these might be related to polynomials and number fields, they don't directly address the core issue of simplifying expressions containing powers or handling the `simplify` function. Therefore, I focus on the initial context provided and the files `powsimp.py`, `power.py`, and `simplify.py`.\n\nRelevant code spans from these files include the `powsimp` function definition in `powsimp.py`, the `Pow` class definition in `power.py`, and the `simplify` function in `simplify.py`.
