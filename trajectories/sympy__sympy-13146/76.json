The issue involves using `sympy.simplify` to simplify an expression that should result in zero but doesn't. This suggests looking at how `simplify` is defined and used within these modules. The `Expr.simplify` method in `sympy.core.expr` calls `sympy.simplify.simplify`, and the `Pow` class in `sympy.core.power` is also relevant as it handles powers. Thus, these are the key areas to focus on.\n\nThe search results include several files, but the primary relevance lies in `sympy/core/expr.py` for the `Expr` class and its `simplify` method, which directly relates to the issue of simplifying expressions. Additionally, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` contains the `simplify` function, which is fundamental to the simplification process. These two modules are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.\n\nAlthough other files contain `simplify` methods, they are not directly related to the core simplification of mathematical expressions as handled by `sympy.simplify.simplify`.
