The provided code snippets and files suggest that the problem might be related to the handling of power operations (specifically exponents) and the simplification logic. Relevant files include those dealing with power operations in sympy.core, simplification functions in sympy.simplify, and numeric evaluation in sympy.core.evalf. Given the error and the desired output of simplifying the expression to zero, it's crucial to focus on the simplification logic and power handling functions in SymPy.",
