If the `Collector` detects that it's dealing with a single instance that can be fast deleted, it handles the deletion differently compared to a batch delete. This pathway needs to be carefully examined to ensure that the result format is consistent even when there are zero objects to delete. Given the existing logic in `Collector.delete`, it attempts to return a tuple with count and a dictionary of model deletion counts. However, there is a specific case where if the model count is zero, it currently returns `(0,{})` which is not an empty dictionary with zero counter values for each model. This pathway in the fast delete scenario needs to be modified to ensure it follows the principle of returning a consistent result format whether or not objects are present. The fast delete case might currently lack handling for the zero object scenario where it could be possible to improve the handling to include model labels with zero value counts.",
