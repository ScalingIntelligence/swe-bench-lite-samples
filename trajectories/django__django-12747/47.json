These spans include definitions of the delete method in both the QuerySet class and the Model class. Furthermore, the Collector class within the deletion module is also significant as it collects and deletes objects, which is instrumental in understanding how the deletion and counting of objects occur. \n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided search results, the identified spans directly address how Django's ORM handles deletion and counts deleted objects, especially in scenarios with or without foreign keys.

This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure consistent behavior. The relevant code spans to look at are those related to the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector.delete method, as these methods handle the deletion of objects and the resulting format.
