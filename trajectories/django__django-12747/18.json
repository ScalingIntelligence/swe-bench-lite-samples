Specifically, the expected format is a tuple where the second element is a dictionary that could potentially be empty or have model labels with zero values. However, for 'simple' models without foreign keys, this dictionary includes zero values for the model, which is inconsistent with models that do have foreign keys. To address this, I should focus on the QuerySet.delete method and related deletion logic in the provided context files. I will also consider the 'Collector' class and its delete method since it is directly involved in the deletion process and might hold the logic causing the inconsistency.",

For 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is a tuple: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\n\nThe expectation is that there should be no difference between these two cases; either both should return the empty dictionary or both should return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code spans that need to be analyzed and possibly modified are found in the `QuerySet.delete` method within the `django/db/models/query.py` file and the `Collector.delete` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file. These methods are responsible for the actual deletion process and the return of the deletion results.\n\n1. In the `QuerySet.delete` method, the focus is on the lines that handle the actual deletion and the construction of the returned tuple. Specifically, these lines involve the `collector.delete()` call.\n\n2. In the `Collector.delete` method, the relevant sections are those that iterate over the models and instances to count the deletions and construct the result dictionary. The focus should be on ensuring uniformity in how the result dictionary is constructed when no objects are deleted, regardless of the presence of foreign keys.\n\nBy reviewing these specific code spans, we can identify the necessary modifications to ensure consistent behavior in the result format when zero objects are deleted.",
