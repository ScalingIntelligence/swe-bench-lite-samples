Process New Search Results: The new search results show the same file and spans, which could signify a comprehensive view. The Collector.delete method adjusts the 'deleted_counter' and returns the tally of deleted objects. This procedure should be thoroughly assessed for compliance with issue requirements. The problem likely stems from differing treatment of models with or without foreign keys and how 'zero-delete' scenarios are managed.
