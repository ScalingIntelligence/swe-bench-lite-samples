It states that the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. The search results provided include implementations of the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector.delete method, which are relevant to the issue. Specifically, the QuerySet.delete method calls the Collector.delete method to perform the actual deletion, and the Collector.delete method constructs the final result tuple. The code related to the deletion logic and the construction of the result format is found in 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. Additionally, 'django/db/models/base.py' contains the Model.delete method, which is likely relevant as it also deals with deletion and might affect the overall behavior when zero objects are deleted.
