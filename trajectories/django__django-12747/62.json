Specifically, it discusses the format of the result tuple (X, Y), where X is the total number of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each model.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are primarily located in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. These files contain the implementation of the QuerySet class and the Collector class, respectively. The critical methods to examine are QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete, as they directly handle the deletion logic and the return values.\n\nFor the QuerySet.delete method, the code sets up the query for deletion and invokes the Collector to handle the actual deletion process. In the Collector.delete method, the code iterates through the data to gather instances to be deleted and performs the deletion, counting the number of instances deleted for each model. This method constructs the result tuple (total deleted, {model: count}) and returns it.\n\nThe code analysis shows that the inconsistency described in the issue could arise from how the deletion process is handled in the Collector.delete method, particularly in the counting mechanism for each model. This analysis confirms the high relevance of the provided code spans to the reported issue and suggests that further investigation should focus on refining the counting logic in the Collector class to ensure consistency in the result tuple when zero objects are deleted.",
