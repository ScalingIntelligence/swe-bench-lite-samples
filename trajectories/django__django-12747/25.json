The issue mentions that the result should be consistent, either both having an empty dictionary or both having dictionary with model-label keys and zero value, regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans. These include the Collector class (specifically the add, add_dependency, add_field_update, and related methods) and the QuerySet.delete method which directly handles the deletion process. The Collector.delete method is particularly relevant as it handles the actual deletion and returns the result tuple (X, Y), which is the focus of the issue. The identified spans can help implement a consistent result format when no objects are deleted, ensuring the format is the same whether the model has foreign keys or not. Therefore, these code spans are directly related to the reported issue and can be used to address the inconsistency. The search task is complete with these identified spans.",
