            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.delete method when zero objects are deleted. The issue identifies two different scenarios where the result differs. The goal is to analyze the provided code spans to determine if they address the described issue.\n\nFirst, I examined the span containing the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py'. This method invokes a collector to handle the deletion process. The delete method of QuerySet is crucial as it orchestrates the deletion process including the collection and actual deletion of objects.\n\nNext, I looked at the 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. Here, the method handles the actual deletion of objects and constructs the result tuple. The method collects instances to be deleted, sorts them, and calculates the count of deletions per model type. This method seems particularly relevant as it directly addresses the actual deletion and result formatting, which is central to the issue.\n\nFinally, I considered the 'DeleteQuery.delete_batch' method in 'django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py'. This method is responsible for executing batch deletions, processing a list of primary keys and returning the count of deleted records. However, this method primarily deals with SQL execution and might not directly impact the reported issue unless errors or side effects manifest during the SQL operations.\n\nGiven the focus of the issue on the format consistency of delete results, the 'QuerySet.delete' and 'Collector.delete' methods are most relevant. These methods are where the structural changes would need to be applied to ensure consistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted.",

The Collector class collects instances to be deleted and processes them, including handling foreign key dependencies and sending pre_delete and post_delete signals. The delete method in QuerySet initializes the Collector and calls its delete method. This setup should cover the bases for addressing the inconsistency described in the issue. The issue indicates that the results might vary when deleting zero objects depending on foreign key relationships, which could be handled in the Collector class during the deletion process. Based on the context provided, all relevant aspects of the deletion logic appear to be included. The only missing bit might be directly seeing how DeleteQuery handles the SQL deletion logic, as it might influence the result format.
