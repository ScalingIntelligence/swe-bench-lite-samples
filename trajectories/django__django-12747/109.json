The issue suggests that the expected behavior is for both cases to either have an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. Analyzing the provided search results, we can see key sections of code that are directly related to the delete functionality within the QuerySet class and the Collector class. These sections include the delete method in QuerySet, the collect method in Collector, and the delete method in Collector. The delete method in QuerySet is particularly important as it is directly responsible for the deletion of objects and returns the result tuple. The Collector class is responsible for collecting and deleting objects, and its delete method processes the actual deletion and returns counts of deleted objects. These sections of code are crucial for understanding and addressing the reported issue.",

The delete_batch method is responsible for handling the actual batch deletion of objects in the database, while the delete method in the Collector class orchestrates the overall deletion process, including handling signals and updating counters. Given the existing code context, it appears that the delete method already takes into account the possibility of zero objects being deleted, as it initializes a Counter for deleted objects and updates this counter based on the actual deletions performed. However, there's a specific concern regarding the formatting of the result when zero objects are deleted, especially for models with and without foreign keys. The focus should be on ensuring that the result format is consistent in all scenarios, potentially adjusting how the Counter is initialized and returned if no objects are deleted.",
