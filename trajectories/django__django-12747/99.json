            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.delete method when zero objects are deleted. Specifically, it notes that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), but for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is for both cases to either have an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nIn the search results, three key sections of code are relevant:\n1. In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet.delete` method is defined. This method collects related objects to be deleted and then calls the `delete` method on the `Collector` class.\n2. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method is detailed. This method handles the actual deletion of objects and returns the count of deleted objects along with a dictionary of model labels and their respective deletion counts.\n3. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete` method is defined, which is used for deleting individual model instances.\n\nTo address the reported issue, the most relevant code spans are those in `QuerySet.delete` and `Collector.delete`, as they handle the bulk of the deletion logic and the return of the deletion results. Specifically, the inconsistency in results when zero objects are deleted likely originates from the `Collector.delete` method, where the condition for handling zero deletions needs to be reviewed and possibly adjusted for consistency.\n\nGiven the complexity of Django's internals, especially around deletion operations that involve foreign keys and model inheritance, a careful review of how empty result sets are handled across different types of models (with and without foreign keys) is crucial.\n\nThe identified relevant code spans provide a starting point for exploring the issue, but due to the depth of Django's ORM logic and the potential for cascading effects across different parts of the codebase, more in-depth analysis is recommended to fully understand and resolve the reported inconsistency.",
