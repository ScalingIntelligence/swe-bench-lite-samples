Specifically, the result format is expected to be consistent for cases with or without foreign keys. I will focus my search on the django/db/models directories since these are the primary locations where the delete functionality would be implemented. Given the hint, I'll start by looking at the delete method in the QuerySet class and the Collector class which are likely to handle the deletion logic.",

To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the deletion process and the structure of the returned results. From the provided search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n\n1. In 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'delete' method of the 'QuerySet' class handles the deletion logic and returns the deleted object count and a dictionary of deleted objects per model. This is where the tuple (X, Y) is constructed.\n\n2. In 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Collector' class is responsible for actual deletion and returning the count of deleted objects and the dictionary detailing the deletions per model. This class is used by the QuerySet's delete method.\n\n3. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Model' class utilizes the 'Collector' to handle the deletion of individual model instances, which is also relevant to understanding how deletions are processed in Django.\n\nThese code spans collectively cover the main logic around model deletion and the construction of the deletion results, making them relevant to resolving the issue of inconsistent result formatting when zero objects are deleted.",
