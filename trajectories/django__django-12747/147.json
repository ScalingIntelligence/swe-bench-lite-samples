From the search results, we can see the implementation of the QuerySet.delete method in the django/db/models/query.py file and the Collector class in the django/db/models/deletion.py file. The QuerySet.delete method calls the Collector's delete method, which is responsible for collecting and deleting objects. The Collector class methods such as collect and delete are critical as they handle the deletion logic and the result format. These methods need to be reviewed to ensure consistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted.
