In 'django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py', there are spans for 'DeleteQuery' and 'DeleteQuery.delete_batch', both of which are relevant as DeleteQuery is used within the delete operation of QuerySet. Based on the analysis, the 'QuerySet.delete' span in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the 'DeleteQuery' and 'DeleteQuery.delete_batch' spans in 'django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py' are the most relevant to the reported issue.
