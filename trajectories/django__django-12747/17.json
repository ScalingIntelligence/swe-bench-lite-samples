The expected behavior is that the result format should be consistent for both cases either both will have the empty dictionary or both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value. To address this, I will focus my search on the django/db/models/query.py file since it contains the definition of the QuerySet class, which includes the delete method. I will also look into the django/db/models/deletion.py file as it contains the Collector class which is likely involved in the deletion process.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.delete method when zero objects are deleted. Specifically, it notes that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is for both cases to either return the empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, we can identify relevant code spans in the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` files. The `QuerySet.delete` method in `query.py` is responsible for initiating the delete operation and managing the query parameters. The `Collector.delete` method in `deletion.py` handles the actual deletion process and formatting of the result.\n\nThe key sections to examine are where the result tuple is constructed and returned in the `Collector.delete` method. This involves checking how the `deleted_counter` is initialized and updated, and how it is converted into the final result tuple. The issue suggests a need to ensure consistency in the result format regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not. Looking at the code, it appears that the `deleted_counter` (a Counter object) is used to accumulate the number of deleted instances for each model. The result is then returned as a tuple, where the first element is the total count of deleted objects and the second element is a dictionary mapping model labels to the count of deleted instances.\n\nGiven these observations and the goal of achieving consistency, the identified code spans are indeed relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
