We need to investigate the code within the QuerySet.delete method to understand how it handles the deletion of zero objects, especially in cases with and without foreign keys. The relevant files seem to be those related to model deletion logic. We should focus on the 'delete' method within the QuerySet class and the Collector class, as these are likely to handle the deletion logic and the collection of objects to be deleted. Additionally, understanding the deletion process in the context of foreign keys (as handled by the Collector class and the 'delete' method in the model base class) will be crucial.",

The current task is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with QuerySet.Delete and Collector.delete methods from the provided search results. The search results contain multiple files, including 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet.delete' method is a key part of the issue. Also, 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is crucial for understanding how deletions are handled. These methods are directly related to the reported issue by managing the deletion process and the format of the result tuple. Therefore, these two spans are identified as the most relevant for the reported issue. However, there are other sections in the 'django/db/models/query.py' file that are indirectly related, such as '_raw_delete', 'update', and other supporting functions like 'add_field_update' and 'related_objects' in the 'Collector' class. These functions are not directly related to the inconsistency reported but provide context on how the deletion process works, adding to the overall understanding of the codebase.",

The `delete` method in the `QuerySet` class collects the relevant data and then processes the delete operation through the `Collector` class. The `Collector` class sorts and deletes the models, maintains a count of deleted instances, and manages related operations such as sending signals and updating fields. This provides a comprehensive view of how model deletion is handled, including contexts with and without foreign keys. Based on the provided code, all relevant aspects of the model deletion process are covered, including the handling of zero deletions, which appears to be the focus of the reported issue.
