Specifically, the method returns a tuple where the second element is expected to be a dictionary indicating the number of deleted objects per model. However, when no objects are deleted, the return value differs based on whether the model involves foreign keys or not. This inconsistency needs to be addressed in the codebase. The relevant files identified in the context suggest that the `QuerySet.delete()` method implementation is likely in `django/db/models/query.py` or closely related files like `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py`. Additionally, tracing the `delete` method through `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` might be necessary to understand the full scope of the issue.",

This inconsistency should be resolved to ensure a uniform result format in all cases.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are:\n- `QuerySet.delete` in `django/db/models/query.py` which handles the deletion process.\n- `Collector.delete` in `django/db/models/deletion.py` which collects and sorts objects for deletion, ensuring related objects are also handled according to their delete rules.\n\nThese methods need to be reviewed to ensure that the result format is consistent when zero objects are deleted.
