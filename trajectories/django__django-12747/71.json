Specifically, for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}) while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expectation is that both cases should yield results that are consistent either way.\n\nIn analyzing the search results, the relevant sections are found in the `django/db/models/query.py` file within the QuerySet class, particularly the `QuerySet.delete` method. This method is responsible for deleting the objects in the QuerySet and returning the result. Additionally, the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` is significant as it handles the actual deletion process and returns the counts of deleted objects.\n\nGiven the issue description, these two code spans appear to be directly related to the problem at hand, as they deal with the deletion logic and the return of the deletion results. However, further analysis would be needed to ensure that these are the only relevant spans or if additional spans across files need to be considered for a full understanding of the issue and potential solutions.",
