Specifically, I focused on the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the Collector.delete method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py', which are central to the deletion logic. These methods manage the deletion of objects and return the result in the form of a tuple. The identified code spans contain the necessary logic to understand how the deletion process is carried out and how the result is formatted, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue. I have also considered the entire sections of code, not just isolated spans, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the deletion process and result formatting.
