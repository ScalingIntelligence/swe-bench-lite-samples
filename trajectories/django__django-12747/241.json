The inconsistency arises in the result tuple (X, Y) where Y is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each model. When zero objects are deleted, the result differs based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. I analyzed the relevant portions of the codebase from 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/query.py'. In 'deletion.py', the 'Collector.delete' method is responsible for the deletion process and returns the tuple with total deleted objects and a dictionary of model counters. In 'query.py', the 'QuerySet.delete' method calls the 'Collector.delete' method to perform the actual deletion. Based on the issue description, the code spans that are relevant to the reported issue are those that handle the deletion logic and the result return in the 'Collector.delete' method. I identified the specific spans that contain the relevant logic to address the issue.",
