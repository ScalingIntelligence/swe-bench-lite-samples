            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the inconsistency of the result format from the `QuerySet.delete` method when zero objects are deleted. There are two main concerns: 1. The tuple format should be consistent regardless of whether there are foreign keys involved. 2. The expected behavior is that either both cases (with and without foreign keys) should return an empty dictionary or both should return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/query.py` (specifically the `QuerySet.delete` method) and `django/db/models/deletion.py` (specifically the `Collector.delete` method). Both of these methods are central to the deletion process and can be modified to ensure consistent results.\n\n1. **QuerySet.delete**: This method initiates the deletion process and collects the objects to be deleted using the `Collector` class. Modifying this method could help ensure that the deletion process starts with a consistent state.\n\n2. **Collector.delete**: This method actually performs the deletion and returns the result. The current implementation already returns a tuple with the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary of deleted objects per model. However, it lacks handling for the case when zero objects are deleted, which seems to be the cause of the inconsistency.\n\nBy focusing on these two methods, we can introduce additional checks and adjustments to ensure that the result format is consistent, even when zero objects are deleted. This involves adding logic to handle the case when no objects are found for deletion, ensuring that both empty and model-specific dictionaries are consistently returned.",
