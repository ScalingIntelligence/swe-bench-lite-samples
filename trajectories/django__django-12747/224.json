The expected behavior is uniformity in the result tuple for both cases: either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model labels and zero values. The provided search results reveal essential parts of the code: 1. The `QuerySet.delete` method where the `collector` is utilized to perform the actual deletion and gather the results. 2. The `Collector` class which contains the `delete` method responsible for collecting and deleting items in the database, as well as returning the deletion results. To address the reported issue, it's crucial to ensure consistency in the return value from the `Collector.delete` method, specifically for cases where no objects are deleted. The current implementation may need to be adjusted to consistently return a dictionary with model labels and zero values when no objects are deleted, regardless of the model's structure.

The Collector.delete method then processes these collected objects and returns the count of deleted objects along with a dictionary of deleted object counts for each model. To address the inconsistency reported, it would be necessary to review the logic in the Collector.delete method to ensure that the dictionary returned always contains model-label keys with zero values when no objects are deleted, regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. Additionally, the search results show the get_candidate_relations_to_delete function, which identifies relations that should be deleted, and the Collector.collect method, which collects objects for deletion.

To address this, understanding the existing implementation and identifying where the result format is determined is crucial. The provided file context and search results involve key components like the QuerySet class with its delete method and the Collector class with its delete method. The search results expand on the Collector class, showing additional methods like collect and helper functions like get_candidate_relations_to_delete. These are relevant as they help in understanding how the deletion process is managed and how related objects are handled. The identified code spans focus on the core functionalities of collecting and deleting objects, which directly influence the result format.

For models with foreign keys, this method ensures that the deletion process respects foreign key constraints and cascades appropriately. When no objects are deleted, the `deleted_counter` counter should ideally reflect this by showing 0 for all models involved. This counter is ultimately returned by the `Collector.delete` method, which iterates over all objects flagged for deletion and sends the appropriate signals. As per the code, when the deletion happens, the `deleted_counter` is incremented for the models' label and this count is used to determine what was deleted. The inconsistency in the feedback when zero entries are deleted - one scenario returning an empty dictionary ({}) and in other returning a dictionary with the model's label mapped to 0 ({<model_label>: 0}) - isn't directly clear from the `Collector.collect` function, but could be influenced by the depth and scope of the query. Specifically, the issue might stem from how the `Collector` distinguishes between batches of objects and individual instances for deletion, especially around line where it processes and places objects in deletion order by model.",
