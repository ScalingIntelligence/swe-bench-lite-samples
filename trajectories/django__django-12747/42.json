The expected behavior is for the result to be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. The current behavior is that models without foreign keys return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values, while models with foreign keys return an empty dictionary when no objects are deleted.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to understand the code responsible for handling the deletion process within the QuerySet and the Collector classes. Specifically, we should focus on the delete methods in these classes.\n\n1. In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet.delete` method initializes the deletion process. This method sets up the `Collector` and calls its delete method. The relevance of this code span is that it triggers the deletion process, which is central to the issue.\n\n2. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method handles the actual deletion of objects. This method collects and organizes the objects to be deleted, calculates the counts for each model, and performs the deletions. The relevance of this code span is that it determines the structure and content of the deletion result, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the deletion process to ensure consistent results when zero objects are deleted.",
