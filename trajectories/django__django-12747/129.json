The expected result format is a tuple (X, Y) where X is the total amount of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary with model labels as keys and counts of deleted objects as values. The inconsistency arises when there are zero objects to delete: for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), but for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'model_label': 0}). We need to investigate the implementation of the QuerySet.delete method across the provided files to understand why this inconsistency occurs and how it can be resolved.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the inconsistent result format of the QuerySet.delete method when no objects are deleted. The issue describes that the result format should be consistent regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not. The key elements to look for in the code are the implementation of the delete method in QuerySet and its associated classes like Collector, which handles the actual deletion process, and Model, which defines the base delete method for instances. \n\nUpon analyzing the search results, it appears that there are multiple implementations of the delete method across various classes, including QuerySet, Collector, Model, and others. The QuerySet.delete method is directly relevant as it orchestrates the deletion process. The Collector class, which is used within QuerySet.delete, handles the collection of objects to be deleted and their cascading actions, which is crucial for understanding how the deletion process works, particularly in relation to foreign keys. The Model.delete method is also relevant as it defines the base delete behavior for model instances. \n\nThe code spans identified as relevant include:\n- QuerySet.delete: Defines the overall delete process for QuerySets.\n- Collector.delete: Manages the actual deletion of collected objects, including handling foreign keys.\n- Model.delete: Base delete method for model instances, crucial for understanding how individual instances are deleted.\n- FieldFile.delete: Although not directly related to QuerySet, it demonstrates how file deletions are handled in model fields, which could be relevant in the context of foreign key constraints involving file fields.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reported issue and the search results, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how the delete functionality is implemented in Django, covering both the orchestration at the QuerySet level and the detailed handling of individual instances and foreign key relationships.",
