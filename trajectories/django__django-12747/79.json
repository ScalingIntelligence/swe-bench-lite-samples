Specifically, the issue focuses on the tuple (X, Y) where X represents the total amount of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary that specifies counters of deleted objects for each model. The inconsistency arises when there are no objects to delete: for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}) while for simple models without foreign keys, it is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). To address this, it is necessary to review the implementation of the delete method in both QuerySet and Collector classes in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py respectively. The relevant code spans include the entire delete method in both classes to understand the flow and logic of object deletion, especially how the counters and dictionaries are handled when no objects are deleted. This analysis will help in identifying the points where the output differs based on the presence or absence of foreign keys.",
