The issue identifies two scenarios: one where the result is (0, {}) for models with foreign keys, and another where the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}) for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior in both cases, either with an empty dictionary or a dictionary containing model-label keys with zero values.\n\nWe need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the deletion process and specifically those that manage the return format of the delete operation when no objects are deleted. From the search results, the following code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. 'django/db/models/query.py' - Span 'QuerySet.delete' handles the delete operation for QuerySet. It initializes a Collector and collects the queryset to be deleted. This is likely where the deletion logic and return format are managed.\n\n2. 'django/db/models/deletion.py' - Span 'Collector.delete' contains the logic for deleting objects collected by the Collector. It includes the handling of fast deletes and the atomic deletion process, which are critical for understanding how the delete results are formatted.\n\n3. 'django/db/models/base.py' - Span 'Model.delete' provides the method for individual model instance deletion, which is less directly related to the reported issue but provides context on how deletion works at a single instance level.\n\nWe will focus on identifying spans in 'QuerySet.delete' and 'Collector.delete' as they directly impact the issue's requirements by managing the deletion operations and their return values.",
