To resolve this, we need to identify where the `delete` method of `QuerySet` is defined and how it handles the return values. We should also check the `Collector` class's `delete` method, as it plays a significant role in the deletion process. Additionally, looking into the `DeleteQuery` class in the `subqueries.py` file can provide insights into how deletions are batched and processed.",

There are two scenarios mentioned: one for models with foreign keys and one for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The desired behavior is to have a consistent result format for both cases.\n\nFrom the provided search results, I analyzed the code spans in the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` files. Specifically, I focused on the `QuerySet.delete` and `Collector.delete` methods.\n\nIn the `QuerySet.delete` method, it calls the `Collector.delete` method, which handles the actual deletion process. The `Collector.delete` method collects instances and handles the pre_delete and post_delete signals. It also calculates the deleted counters for each model.\n\nThe identified sections of code are crucial because they directly relate to the deletion process and the calculation of the deleted objects. The `QuerySet.delete` method defines the overall workflow, while the `Collector.delete` method contains the logic for determining the deleted counters, which is central to resolving the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, I have identified the relevant file and specific code spans that are crucial for addressing the reported issue. This includes the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method from the respective files.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the current implementation does not explicitly handle the scenario where zero objects are deleted, leading to the inconsistency mentioned in the issue. This would likely require additional logic within the `Collector.delete` method to ensure that the result format is consistent regardless of whether foreign keys are involved or not.",
