The search results contain several relevant code spans, notably: \n\n1. `Model.delete` in `django/db/models/base.py`: This method is responsible for deleting individual model instances. It uses a Collector to manage the deletion process. Identifying this method helps in understanding the primary deletion mechanism in Django's ORM.\n\n2. `Collector.collect` and `Collector.delete` in `django/db/models/deletion.py`: These methods are central to the deletion process, handling the collection and actual deletion of objects, including related objects through foreign keys. This is crucial for understanding how Django handles cascading deletes and the logic for determining which objects to delete.\n\n3. `QuerySet.delete` in `django/db/models/query.py`: This method handles the deletion for QuerySets, which could include multiple objects. It uses a Collector to collect and delete objects in bulk, which is particularly relevant for the reported issue about the result format when no objects are deleted.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can understand the flow of the deletion process in Django, focusing on how the Collector class interacts with model instances and QuerySets to manage deletions, including handling of foreign keys and cascading effects.\n\nThese identified code spans should provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles deletions, including the inconsistencies mentioned in the reported issue.",
