I will analyze the provided code spans to identify any relevant parts that might be causing this inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I look at the 'Model.delete' span in 'django/db/models/base.py'. This method defines the delete operation for a single model instance and uses the Collector class to handle the deletion. The 'Model.delete' method seems relevant as it initializes the deletion process.\n\nNext, I examine the 'Collector.delete' span in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. This method is responsible for the actual deletion of collected objects and returns the count of deleted objects. The logic here will be significant to understand how the counts are managed and returned.\n\nLastly, I check the 'QuerySet.delete' span in 'django/db/models/query.py'. This method initiates the deletion process for the QuerySet and uses the Collector to perform the bulk deletion. This method is crucial as it directly handles the QuerySet deletion that the issue is concerned with.\n\nThese three spans seem to cover the main aspects of the deletion process in Django's ORM, from the individual model instance deletion to the bulk deletion of QuerySets. I will extract these relevant spans for further analysis.",
