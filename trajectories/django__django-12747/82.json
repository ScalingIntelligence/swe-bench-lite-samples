The 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'query.py' is responsible for the deletion process, and it uses the 'Collector' class from 'deletion.py' to manage the deletion of related objects. The issue likely arises from how the 'Collector.delete' method handles cases where no objects are to be deleted, especially concerning the dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each model.

Specifically, the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector.delete method are crucial for understanding how the deletion process works and how the result format might be affected. The QuerySet.delete method invokes the Collector's delete method, which handles the actual deletion logic and returns the result. The Collector.delete method iterates through the models and instances to be deleted, sending pre_delete and post_delete signals, and then actually performs the deletions. The method constructs and returns the deleted_counter which maintains the count of objects deleted per model. Since the relevant methods responsible for handling deletions and returning deletion results are present in the provided code, it suggests that the necessary parts for addressing the issue are included.",
