This inconsistency arises when dealing with models with and without foreign keys. The expected behavior is to have a consistent result format in all cases, either with an empty dictionary or a dictionary containing model-label keys with zero values.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the relevant files and code spans are:\n\n1. `django/db/models/query.py` - This file contains the implementation of the `QuerySet` class with the `delete` method. This method is central to the issue as it handles the deletion of objects.\n\n2. `django/db/models/deletion.py` - This file contains the `Collector` class which is used by the `QuerySet.delete` method. The `Collector.delete` method is particularly relevant as it collects and deletes objects, forming the core logic of the deletion process.\n\n3. `django/db/models/base.py` - This file contains the `Model` class with its `delete` method. This method is a higher-level abstraction for deleting individual model instances and also uses the `Collector`.\n\nBy examining these files and methods, we can identify the specific code spans that deal with the logic of deleting objects and returning the result. The issue likely involves adjustments to how the `Collector` class handles the counting and reporting of deleted objects, especially when zero objects are involved.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I've selected the relevant code spans that are directly related to the issue at hand, focusing on the `delete` methods in the `QuerySet` and `Collector` classes.",
