Specifically, when deleting from models with foreign keys versus 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result format differs. For models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models, it is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is for both cases to either return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. Given the context, the relevant files identified are mostly in the django/db/models directory, focusing on deletion logic. The QuerySet class in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the delete method in 'django/db/models/base.py' are key areas to investigate. The 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file, particularly the Collector class, also seems crucial as it handles collection and deletion of objects. Additional focus should be on the DeleteQuery class in 'django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py' and SQLDeleteCompiler in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' as they handle the SQL compilation for delete operations.",
