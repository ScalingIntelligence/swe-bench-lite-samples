It is mentioned that the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. Based on the provided context, the focus should be on the methods related to delete operations in the QuerySet class and the DeleteQuery class. These classes are likely to contain the relevant code to address the issue. Furthermore, the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py which is involved in the deletion process should also be examined for its role in handling the counts and labels of deleted objects.",
