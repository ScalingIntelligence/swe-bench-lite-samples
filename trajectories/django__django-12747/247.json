Upon analyzing the search results, I identified the relevant code spans in `django/db/models/query.py` where the `QuerySet.delete()` method is defined. This method uses a `Collector` object to collect and delete objects, and it returns the number of deleted objects and a dictionary with counters for each model. I also looked into the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file to understand how the `Collector` class operates, particularly the `delete()` method that is responsible for performing the actual deletion and returning the necessary counts and dictionaries. The definition of the `Model.delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` was also relevant as it showcases how the `Collector` is used to manage the deletion process for individual model instances. Additionally, in `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py`, the `DeleteQuery.delete_batch()` method is relevant for understanding how batched deletions are handled, thereby impacting the result consistency.",
