Specifically, when there are zero objects to delete, the result format differs between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is for the result format to be consistent in both cases. After analyzing the search results, I have identified relevant code spans that deal with the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting objects. These spans include the QuerySet.delete method itself, the Model.delete method, and the Collector class, especially the collect and delete methods within the Collector class. These methods handle the deletion logic and would need to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure consistent results when zero objects are deleted.",
