The issue describes different behaviors for models with and without foreign keys. To identify the relevant code, we need to examine the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector.delete method, which are central to the deletion process in Django's ORM. The QuerySet.delete method is responsible for initiating the deletion process and returns the results. The Collector.delete method is responsible for collecting and deleting the objects, and it also returns the counts of deleted objects. The analysis of these methods suggests that the inconsistency arises from the way the Collector.delete method handles the deletion and aggregation of results. Specifically, the method does not ensure that an entry with a count of zero is always included in the result dictionary for cases where no objects are deleted. This is likely the root cause of the inconsistent behavior described in the issue.",
