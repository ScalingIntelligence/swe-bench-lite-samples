Specifically, it mentions that for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is `(0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})`, whereas for models with foreign keys, the result is `(0, {})`. The desired behavior is for both cases to return the same result format.\n\nTo address this, we need to focus on the `QuerySet.delete()` method and the `Collector` class, which are responsible for handling the deletion process. The `QuerySet.delete()` method calls the `Collector.collect()` method to gather objects for deletion and then calls `Collector.delete()` to perform the actual deletion.\n\nFrom the search results, we identified key sections of code in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. These include the `delete()` method in `QuerySet`, which interacts with the `Collector` class, and various methods in the `Collector` class that are involved in collecting and deleting objects.\n\nBy examining these code sections, we can see the logic for gathering objects for deletion and the logic for actually deleting them. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle the case where zero objects are deleted to ensure consistent return values. This suggests that the relevant code spans are those that deal with object collection and deletion, particularly the `delete()` method in `QuerySet` and the `collect()` and `delete()` methods in `Collector`.\n\nThese code spans will need to be modified to ensure consistent handling of the result format when zero objects are deleted.",
