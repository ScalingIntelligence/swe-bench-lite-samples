Specifically, the issue is that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy is what needs to be addressed.\n\nFrom the provided context, the QuerySet.delete method is responsible for handling the delete operation and returns a tuple of the count of deleted objects and a dictionary of model deletion counts. The logic for collecting and deleting objects is handled by the Collector class in the deletion.py file.\n\nReviewing the new search results, we see that the Collector class's delete method continues to handle the actual deletion process and returns the result in the expected format. The issue seems to be more about how the deletion logic distinguishes between models with and without foreign keys, and how it initializes the deleted_counter in both scenarios.\n\nGiven that the code already structures the return value in the desired tuple format, the focus should be on how the deleted_counter is populated when no objects are deleted. This might involve adjustments in the condition under which the deleted_counter dictionary includes all model labels with zero counts versus being empty. Currently, if there are no objects to delete, the dictionary does not include the model labels, which might need to be amended to ensure consistency.\n\nFurther examination of the delete method's logic in the Collector class might lead to identification of a condition or initiation step that differs for models with and without foreign keys. Adjusting logic around these moments could help ensure that the dictionary includes zero counts for all target models, regardless of their relationship structure.",

There are two cases mentioned: one for models with foreign keys and another for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected outcome is that both cases should return either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nThe current context already provides a detailed view of the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector class's delete method, which is central to understanding how deletions are handled. The new search results essentially repeat the context provided, focusing on the Collector class's delete method. This method initializes a Counter to keep track of deleted objects and processes deletions, including handling pre_delete and post_delete signals and updating counters for each model.\n\nUpon reviewing the entire section of code in the Collector.delete method, it is evident that the counters for deleted objects are managed using the Counter class from the collections module. The method returns a tuple with the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary detailing the counts for each model label.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis of the code relevant to the issue, there are no apparent gaps in understanding the logic that handles deletions and the return format in the case of zero objects to delete.
