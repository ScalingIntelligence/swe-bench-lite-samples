This inconsistency seems to be related to how the method handles models with and without foreign keys. To resolve this, we need to investigate the implementation of the delete method in the QuerySet class and the associated Collector class, as they are likely responsible for collecting and deleting objects. It might also be useful to check how models are being processed within these methods, especially in cases where no objects are to be deleted.",

The issue is that the result format varies based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. The expected behavior is a consistent result format regardless of the presence of foreign keys.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, the relevant code spans related to the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector class have been identified. Specifically, the QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete methods are crucial for understanding the behavior and potential fixes for the reported issue.\n\nThe QuerySet.delete method definition in the django/db/models/query.py file shows how the delete method is implemented for the QuerySet class. It uses the Collector to handle the deletion process. The Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py is responsible for collecting objects to be deleted, handling relationships, and performing the actual deletion. The delete method of the Collector class sorts the collected objects, manages signals, and ensures the integrity of the deletion process.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the identified code spans provide a thorough understanding of how the deletion process works in Django. These spans should help in analyzing and potentially fixing the inconsistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted.",
