The expected behavior is for the result to be consistent in both cases, either both returning an empty dictionary or both returning a dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.

Specifically, 'QuerySet.delete' outlines the overall flow of deleting objects and returns the result, while 'Collector.delete' handles the actual deletion and counting of objects.\n\nAmong the key spans, 'QuerySet.delete' identifies the steps taken before calling the collector for deletion. This includes checking conditions and preparing the query for deletion. The 'Collector.delete' span shows how the deletion is executed, including the handling of pre_delete and post_delete signals and the final return of the deletion result. These spans are crucial for understanding how the deletion result is formed and returned.\n\nGiven the issue, examining these code spans will help identify where the inconsistency in the deletion result could arise, particularly in the handling of zero deletions for models with and without foreign keys.
