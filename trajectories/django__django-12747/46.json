To address this, we need to analyze the code span `QuerySet.delete` in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. These sections contain the logic for the delete operation and the handling of the result format. The `Collector.delete` method is particularly crucial as it constructs the result tuple (X, Y), where X is the total number of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary with model labels and their respective counts. By inspecting these code spans, we can identify where the inconsistency arises and how it can be rectified to ensure a consistent result format for all cases.",

Specifically, the QuerySet.delete method delegates the deletion to the Collector.delete method. The Collector class collects all instances to be deleted and handles their removal, including handling foreign keys and signals. The current implementation of Collector.delete handles the counting of deleted objects and returns a tuple where the second element is a dictionary with model labels as keys and corresponding deleted counts as values. This implementation seems to be the focal point for addressing the reported inconsistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted.
