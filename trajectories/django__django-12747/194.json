            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.delete method when zero objects are deleted. The issue specifies that the expected result format is a tuple (X, Y) where X is the total number of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each model. The current behavior shows inconsistency when there are zero objects to delete - for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), and for simple models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}).\n\nTo address this issue, I need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the deletion process and the result formatting for the QuerySet.delete method. I will look for code spans that deal with the Collector class and its methods, especially those responsible for collecting and deleting objects. Additionally, I will look for the QuerySet.delete method itself to understand how it calculates and formats the results.\n\nFrom the search results, the most relevant code spans are from 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. These files contain definitions for the QuerySet class, including the QuerySet.delete method, and the Collector class, which is used for collecting and deleting related objects.\n\nFirst, in 'django/db/models/query.py', the QuerySet.delete method is defined. This method delegates the actual deletion to the Collector class. This is crucial because understanding how the deletion process and its results are managed starts here.\n\nNext, in 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the Collector class is defined, including its delete method. This method is responsible for the actual deletion of objects and the counting of deleted objects by model. Understanding this method is key to addressing the inconsistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted.\n\nIt appears that the relevant code spans I need to focus on are those that deal with the deletion process in the Collector class and the result formatting in the QuerySet.delete method.",
