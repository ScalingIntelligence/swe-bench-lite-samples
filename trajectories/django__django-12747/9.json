This inconsistency is observed in both models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is for both cases to either return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. To address this, it's necessary to locate the specific part of the code responsible for the delete method's result formatting. This task involves searching through the Django ORM codebase, particularly focusing on the QuerySet class and related deletion handling classes like Collector, DeleteQuery, and SQLDeleteCompiler. Identifying the exact method or logic that constructs the delete result tuple will be crucial for understanding and potentially rectifying the issue. Given the details provided, it's important to pinpoint the conditions under which the dictionary is or isn't included in the result tuple when no objects are deleted.",

The issue is that the result format differs based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. To address this issue, we need to focus on the `delete` method within the `QuerySet` class and the `delete` method within the `Collector` class, as these are responsible for handling the deletion logic and returning the result. The provided code spans include the relevant methods and their implementations. Specifically, the `delete` method in `QuerySet` calls the `delete` method in `Collector`, which is where the deletion logic and result formatting occur. By examining these sections, we can identify where adjustments are needed to ensure consistent result formatting regardless of whether the model has foreign keys.",
