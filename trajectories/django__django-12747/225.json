The issue particularly points out discrepancies in the result format (X, Y) when there are zero deleted objects, specifically noting that dictionaries with model-label keys and zero values should be consistently returned. First, I will examine the QuerySet.delete method to understand how the deletion process is initiated and how it interacts with the Collector class. Then, I will review the Collector.delete method to comprehend how it handles and counts deleted objects, especially when there are none to delete.Given the complexity of the code, it's crucial to observe the entire workflow, especially how the deletion counters are updated and what structures are maintained to retain counters for each model. The provided code spans do indeed cover the crucial parts such as query initiation, database implications, and field management. Understanding these pieces is key to determining where the consistency might be lacking or where adjustments could be made.",
