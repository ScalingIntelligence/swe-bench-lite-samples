The issue specifically points out that the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. The expectation is that either both cases will return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are found in two main files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'query.py', the focus is on the 'QuerySet.delete' method which is responsible for handling the delete operation at the QuerySet level. This method uses a 'Collector' class to collect and delete the objects. The 'Collector' class is defined in 'deletion.py' and contains methods like 'delete()' which actually perform the deletion and return the count of deleted objects. This is the core logic that needs to be examined for the reported issue.\n\nThe analysis of these code spans reveals that the 'QuerySet.delete' method indeed uses the 'Collector' to manage deletions and returns a tuple with the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary with the counts per model. The 'Collector.delete()' method iterates over the collected objects, performs the deletion, and tallies the counts. This is the part of the code that likely needs adjustment to ensure consistency in the result format when no objects are deleted.\n\nGiven the issue's description and analysis of the code, it seems that the relevant code spans have been identified. The 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'query.py' and the 'Collector.delete()' method in 'deletion.py' are central to the issue's resolution.",
