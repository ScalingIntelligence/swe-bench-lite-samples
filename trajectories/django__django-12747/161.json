The inconsistency arises between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. To resolve this, we need to examine how the delete method in QuerySet and related classes handle cases where no objects are deleted.

To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that deal with the delete functionality. The analysis involves looking for methods within the QuerySet class that handle the deletion logic. After reviewing, I identified the following key code spans that are relevant to the issue: \n\n1. 'QuerySet.delete' in django/db/models/query.py - This method is the main entry point for deleting objects in a QuerySet. It collects objects to be deleted, handles their deletion, and returns the result.\n\n2. 'Collector.delete' in django/db/models/deletion.py - This method is responsible for the actual deletion of objects after they have been collected. It handles the deletion of objects based on their dependencies.\n\n3. 'Model.delete' in django/db/models/base.py - This method is the instance method for deleting individual model instances, which is used by the QuerySet.delete method via the Collector class.\n\nConsidering the reported issue, these code spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the inconsistency in the delete results. Therefore, they should be analyzed further to implement any necessary changes or to debug the existing behavior.",

The expected behavior is that the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not.

The relevant code spans identified in the file context and search results include the methods `QuerySet.delete`, `Model.delete`, and `Collector.delete`. These methods are responsible for handling the deletion process and returning the result. The `Collector.delete` method constructs the result tuple, which includes a dictionary of deleted objects by model label. The search results provide additional context about how the `Collector` class collects and deletes objects, which helps in understanding the overall deletion process. The task is complete as the relevant code spans are identified, and the analysis provides a good understanding of how the deletion process and resulting tuple are constructed.",
