The expected behavior is that the result format should be consistent in both scenarios. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans can be found in django/db/models/deletion.py and django/db/models/query.py. In deletion.py, the 'Collector.delete' method is responsible for the deletion process, returning a tuple with the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary detailing the number of objects deleted for each model. This aligns with the described issue, especially around line 73 where the deleted_counter is updated. In query.py, the 'QuerySet.delete' method calls the Collector.delete method and processes its return values. These code spans intuitively align with the issues described in the reported issue, as solving the reported issue means making the result format consistent for both scenarios.
