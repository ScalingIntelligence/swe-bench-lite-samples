The issue specifically identifies that the behavior differs between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. To address this, it's crucial to inspect the code responsible for the delete operation, focusing on how the result tuple (X, Y) is constructed and returned.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in two main files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet.delete' method is of particular interest, as it orchestrates the deletion process. It uses the 'Collector' class from 'django/db/models/deletion.py' to manage the collection and deletion of objects.\n\nKey aspects to note include:\n- The 'QuerySet.delete' method (span id 'QuerySet.delete') sets up the deletion query, collects objects to delete, and ultimately calls the 'collector.delete()' method.\n- The 'Collector' class instances manage the deletion process, including handling foreign key relationships (span id 'Collector.collect').\n- The 'Collector.delete' method (span id 'Collector.delete') is central to the deletion process, returning a tuple indicating the number of deleted objects and a dictionary with statistics on model-specific deletions.\n\nGiven the detailed examination, the identified code spans are directly relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the inconsistency issue reported. The next steps would involve deeper analysis within these spans to pinpoint the source of the inconsistency and devise a consistent handling approach for cases where zero objects are deleted.",
