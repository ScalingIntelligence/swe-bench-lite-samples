The issue refers to a tuple (X, Y) where X is the total amount of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each model. The problem occurs when there are zero objects to delete, leading to different results based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. To address this, I need to find the relevant code that handles this logic in both QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete methods. I have found the QuerySet.delete method in django/db/models/query.py and the Collector.delete method in django/db/models/deletion.py. Notably, QuerySet.delete calls the collector.delete() method, which is part of the Collector class. Examining both methods provides a complete view of the logic involved in handling deletions. Based on the analysis, the relevant spans are identified: first from django/db/models/query.py, which includes the QuerySet.delete method and its interactions with the Collector class. Second, the relevant span from django/db/models/deletion.py includes the Collector.delete method, which is crucial for understanding how deletions are handled and results are returned.",

The code indicates that the delete method in QuerySet does indeed construct a result tuple with a total count and a dictionary of model-specific counts. However, the handling of cases where zero objects are deleted is not explicitly addressed in the provided code, suggesting that the inconsistencies described in the issue might not be fully resolved by the current implementation.
