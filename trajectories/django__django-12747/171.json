The expected behavior is that both cases should return the same format, either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nExamining the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. These files contain the implementation of QuerySet.delete() and the Collector class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting objects.\n\nIn django/db/models/query.py, the span 'QuerySet.delete' is directly related as it defines the delete method on the QuerySet class. This method is where the deletion logic is initiated.\n\nIn django/db/models/deletion.py, several spans are relevant: 'Collector.__init__', 'Collector.collect', and 'Collector.delete'. The Collector class is used by the delete method of QuerySet to manage the deletion process, including collecting related objects and performing the actual deletion. These spans provide the context that affects how the deletion process and its result are handled, especially when dealing with zero deleted objects.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the necessary code spans to address the reported issue have been identified. These spans contain the logic that controls the behavior of the delete method in QuerySet and the underlying object deletion process managed by the Collector class.\n\nBy focusing on these code spans, it will be possible to diagnose why the result format is inconsistent and to implement any necessary changes to ensure that the result format is consistently either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values, across all cases, including when zero objects are deleted.",
