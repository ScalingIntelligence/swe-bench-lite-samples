The issue highlights inconsistencies in the result format between models with foreign keys and those without. The analysis of the code reveals the key aspects: \n\n1. The QuerySet.delete() method is defined in 'django/db/models/query.py', which delegates the deletion process to a Collector instance. \n2. The Collector class, found in 'django/db/models/deletion.py', contains the delete() method that handles the actual deletion of objects. It returns a tuple with the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary with model labels and their respective deletion counts. \n3. The Model.delete() method in 'django/db/models/base.py' further supports the individual deletion of model instances. \n\nThese components are critical for addressing the inconsistency mentioned in the reported issue. To improve the consistency of the deletion result format, modifications would likely involve adjusting the logic within the Collector.delete() method to ensure uniformity across different types of models.",
