The issue specifically mentions that the result format should be consistent, either both having an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero value when no objects are deleted, regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to focus on the code spans that are directly involved in the deletion process in Django's source code. The primary candidate section is the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method, which handle the deletion logic and the aggregation of deletion results. The former method sets up the deletion and delegates the actual deletion to the `Collector`, while the latter method performs the deletion and constructs the final output tuple.\n\nBased on the reported issue, it seems that the inconsistency arises in how the `Collector.delete` method handles the case when no objects are deleted. Specifically, when checking the new search results, the `Collector.delete` method needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure that it correctly handles the case where no objects are deleted for both types of models (i.e., models with and without foreign keys) and returns a consistent result format.\n\nBy examining the entire sections of `QuerySet.delete` and `Collector.delete`, I can determine that these spans are crucial for implementing the changes needed to resolve the reported issue. Therefore, these sections are identified as relevant to the reported issue, and their span IDs are recorded accordingly.",
