Specifically, the issue is that for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {}) while for 'simple' models without foreign key, the result is a tuple (0, {<model_label>: 0}). The expected behavior is to have the same result format for both cases, either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero value. To address this, we need to examine the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method, which handles the actual deletion process. From the search results, we see that the `QuerySet.delete` method calls the `Collector.delete` method, which then performs the deletion and returns the count of deleted objects. Given the complexity and the thorough analysis of the provided code, it is clear that modifications should be made in the `Collector.delete` method to ensure consistent results across all cases. Therefore, the chosen code spans are those that directly relate to the deletion process and result formatting, specifically in the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` files.",
