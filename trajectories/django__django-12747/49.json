Analysis of the provided code snippets suggests that the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py and the Model class in django/db/models/base.py are likely places to check for the delete method implementation. The Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py also appears to be related to deletion logic. Focusing on these classes in the respective files would be a logical starting point to understand and resolve the inconsistency.",

To address this, we need to focus on the delete method in QuerySet and the delete method in Model, as well as the Collector class that handles the actual deletion process. The relevant code spans include the entire delete method in QuerySet (span_ids: ['QuerySet.delete']) to understand how it handles the deletion process, the delete method in Model (span_ids: ['Model.delete']) to see how individual model instances are deleted, and all methods in the Collector class (span_ids: ['Collector.__init__', 'Collector.add', 'Collector.add_dependency', 'Collector.add_field_update', 'Collector.add_restricted_objects', 'Collector.clear_restricted_objects_from_set', 'Collector.clear_restricted_objects_from_queryset', 'Collector._has_signal_listeners', 'Collector.can_fast_delete', 'Collector.get_del_batches', 'Collector.collect', 'Collector.related_objects', ..., 'Collector.delete']) to understand how the deletion process is managed. These sections of code are crucial to identify and resolve the inconsistent result format issue.",
