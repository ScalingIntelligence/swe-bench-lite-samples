This method is crucial as it directly handles the deletion of objects and returns the deletion result. The `delete` method uses the `Collector` class to collect and delete objects, making it relevant to the issue.\n\n2. **django/db/models/deletion.py**: This file contains the `Collector` class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting related objects. The `delete` method within this class is pivotal because it forms the core logic of how objects are deleted and how the result is structured. This directly impacts the consistency of the delete result.\n\n3. **django/db/models/base.py**: Although less relevant to the direct issue of result inconsistency, this file contains the `Model.delete` method. It might be used in certain scenarios to delete individual model instances, but the primary logic and inconsistency handling will likely be in the QuerySet and Collector classes mentioned above.\n\nBy focusing on the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method, I can identify the primary areas of the codebase that need to be adjusted to ensure consistent result formatting when zero objects are deleted.",
