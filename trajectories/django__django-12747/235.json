The issue specifically points out that the behavior differs based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. For models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expectation is for a consistent return format in both cases. In analyzing the provided code, I focused on the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the Collector.delete method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. The QuerySet.delete method is responsible for initiating the deletion process, while the Collector.delete method handles the actual deletion and returns the deletion counts. The current implementation in Collector.delete does not explicitly handle the case where no objects are deleted, leading to the observed inconsistency. Given this context, I identified and included the relevant code spans to address the reported issue.",

The inconsistency has been resolved by ensuring that the dictionary (Y) always includes the model labels with zero counts when no objects are deleted. This was achieved by updating the 'delete' method in the 'Collector' class to always include model labels in the dictionary with zero counts, even if no foreign keys are involved.",
