The analysis of the provided code reveals the relevant sections for handling the delete operation. In django/db/models/query.py, the `QuerySet.delete` method is defined, which is responsible for the deletion process and returns the result. The result is further processed in django/db/models/deletion.py in the `Collector.delete` method, where the deletion is executed and the counts of deleted objects are collected. Based on the inconsistent results described in the issue, it appears that adjustments may be needed in the `Collector.delete` method to ensure uniform handling of zero deleted objects, both for models with and without foreign keys. Currently, the method does not explicitly address the case where no objects are deleted, leading to inconsistencies.",
