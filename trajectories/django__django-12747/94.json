The issue specifically points out that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This inconsistency needs to be addressed to ensure a uniform result format in both cases.\n\nThe search results provide code spans that are directly related to the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector class, which handles the deletion process. The QuerySet.delete method is found in the django/db/models/query.py file, and it invokes the Collector class to perform the deletion. The Collector class is detailed in the django/db/models/deletion.py file, which includes methods such as collect, related_objects, instances_with_model, and delete. These methods are crucial for understanding how the deletion process is managed, including how the result tuple is constructed.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it is necessary to examine the delete method in both QuerySet and Collector classes. Specifically, the code spans identified for QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete are highly relevant, as they deal directly with the deletion logic and the construction of the result tuple. Additionally, the initialization and collection methods in the Collector class (Collector.__init__ and Collector.collect) are also relevant for understanding the setup and context of the deletion process. These spans are crucial for identifying where and how the inconsistency arises in the result format.\n\nOverall, the provided code spans effectively cover the necessary points of interest to address the reported issue, providing a comprehensive view of the deletion process and its result formatting.",
