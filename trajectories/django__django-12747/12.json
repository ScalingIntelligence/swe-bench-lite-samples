This problem can be rooted in the way the delete method handles the case of zero objects for models with and without foreign keys. The relevant files and methods to investigate include QuerySet.delete in django/db/models/query.py, Model.delete in django/db/models/base.py, and the Collector class methods in django/db/models/deletion.py. Additionally, the DeleteQuery class in django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py and SQLDeleteCompiler in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py might also be relevant due to their involvement in the SQL generation and execution for deletion operations.",

Specifically, the issue points out that when there are zero objects to delete, the result format differs between models with foreign keys and those without. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that handle the deletion logic and the return format. The main focus is on the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method as they are responsible for performing deletions and returning the deletion results. I will examine these spans to understand how the deletion result is structured and processed, particularly focusing on the scenarios where zero objects are deleted. The identified spans include the `QuerySet.delete`, `Collector.__init__`, `Collector.collect`, and `Collector.delete` methods. These are likely to contain the logic handling the collection and deletion of objects and the formatting of the deletion result.",
