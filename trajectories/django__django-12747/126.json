Specifically, the issue describes two scenarios: one for models with foreign keys and another for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is that both scenarios should return a consistent result. The provided search results include several key areas to examine, such as the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method. These are crucial as they directly relate to the deletion logic and the output format of the delete operation. The `QuerySet.delete` method is found in 'django/db/models/query.py', and it delegates to a `Collector` instance to handle the deletion. The `Collector.delete` method is also found in 'django/db/models/deletion.py', which implements the actual deletion logic and constructs the result tuple. The analysis of these methods should reveal how the result format is currently handled and where adjustments might be needed to ensure consistency in the output.",
