Specifically, it notes that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expectation is that both cases should yield the same result format. To address this, we need to review the code responsible for the delete operation and the collection of delete results. From the search results, two key sections are identified: QuerySet.delete in django/db/models/query.py and Collector.delete in django/db/models/deletion.py. These sections handle the main logic of the delete operation and the collection of deleted objects, respectively. The analysis suggests that adjustments in the Collector.delete method, particularly how it constructs the deleted_counter dictionary, may be necessary to ensure consistency in the result format regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not. By examining these specific code spans, we can determine the necessary modifications to achieve the desired result consistency.",
