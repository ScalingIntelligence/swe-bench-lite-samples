Specifically, it highlights that the result format for models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys differs. The goal is to have a consistent result format in both cases. From the search results, the relevant code spans are located in two main files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'query.py', the 'QuerySet.delete' method is found, which is central to understanding how delete operations are handled. This method calls the 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py'. The 'Collector.delete' method contains logic for deleting objects and returning deletion counts. The method iterates over models and instances, sending pre_delete and post_delete signals and updating deletion counters. This is where the main logic for determining the result format lies. Additionally, 'django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py' contains the 'DeleteQuery.delete_batch' method, which is used in the deletion process but does not directly affect the reported issue. Therefore, the main focus should be on the 'QuerySet.delete' and 'Collector.delete' methods in 'query.py' and 'deletion.py' to address the inconsistency in the result format.",
