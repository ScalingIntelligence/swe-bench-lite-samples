The focus is on ensuring uniformity in the result format for both models with and without foreign keys. By examining the provided file context, it's evident that the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` are key areas to investigate, as they are directly involved in the deletion process. Additionally, the `Collector` class in `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `DeleteQuery` in `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py` might also be relevant for understanding how deletion is handled and the results are structured.",

It uses a `Collector` object to perform the deletion and collects the results.\n2. **Collector.delete**: This method is responsible for performing the actual deletion and returning the deleted count and a dictionary of counters.\n3. **DeleteQuery.delete_batch**: This method handles batch deletion and counts the number of deleted objects.\n\nBy examining these code spans, we can identify where the inconsistency arises and how to address it.
