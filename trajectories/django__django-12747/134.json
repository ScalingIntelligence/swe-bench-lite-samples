Specifically, there is a difference in the returned tuple between models with and without foreign keys when no objects are deleted. To address this, it is crucial to find the relevant sections in the codebase that handle the deletion process and determine how the result tuple is constructed. The search results include two key files: 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/query.py'. These files contain the code for the Collector class and the QuerySet class, which are directly involved in the deletion process. The 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is particularly relevant because it handles the actual deletion logic and constructs the result tuple. The 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'django/db/models/query.py' is also relevant as it initiates the deletion process and returns the result from the Collector. These methods need to be examined in detail to understand how the result format is determined and to identify potential areas for consistency improvement.",

The code provided includes the delete methods in both classes, which handle the deletion process and the result formatting. Specifically, the Collector.delete() method constructs the result tuple (X, Y) where X is the total count of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary of counters for each model. The inconsistency mentioned in the issue is about the behavior when no objects are deleted, especially concerning whether the dictionary Y contains model-label keys with zero values or is empty.
