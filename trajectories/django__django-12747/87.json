The issue specifies that when zero objects are deleted, the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. The expected behavior is to have either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several key spans are relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue:\n\n1. The `QuerySet.delete` method in `django/db/models/query.py`: This method is the main entry point for deleting objects in a QuerySet. It uses a `Collector` object to collect and delete objects.\n\n2. The `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`: This method handles the actual deletion of collected objects and returns a tuple containing the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary with counters of deleted objects per model.\n\n3. The `DeleteQuery.delete_batch` method in `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py`: This method handles batch deletions and returns the number of deleted objects.\n\nThese methods are crucial for understanding how deletions are processed and how the result format is constructed. The inconsistency mentioned in the issue likely needs to be addressed in the `Collector.delete` method, where the result tuple is constructed.\n\nGiven the comprehensive nature of the provided code spans, it appears that the search results cover all necessary aspects to understand and potentially resolve the inconsistent result format issue for the QuerySet.Delete method when zero objects are deleted.",
