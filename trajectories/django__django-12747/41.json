Additionally, the `sql` and `compiler` modules should be checked for any logic related to generating SQL for deletion operations.",

The `delete` method in the `QuerySet` class calls `collector.delete()`, which is the core logic for managing deletions, including handling foreign keys and cascading effects. The `Collector.delete()` method's logic appears to be where the inconsistency mentioned in the issue would arise when no objects are deleted, depending on whether there are foreign keys present. Although the exact lines that would be modified to resolve the inconsistency are not detailed in the provided context (as they likely involve deeper implementation details or checks within the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class), the context provides enough information to identify that the necessary methods and structures are indeed present to address the issue. This suggests that the file context provided is sufficient to understand the scope and location of the code related to the issue, even if not every specific line of code needed for a complete fix is included.",
