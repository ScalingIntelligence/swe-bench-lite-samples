Specifically, the inconsistency arises when comparing models with foreign keys to 'simple' models without foreign keys. To resolve this, we need to investigate how the delete method is implemented in the QuerySet class and related components. We should focus on the query.py, deletion.py, and base.py files, looking for instances of the delete method or related logic that might control the return format.",

To address this, it is necessary to analyze the existing codebase to locate the relevant code spans that handle the delete functionality and determine whether the results are being formatted consistently. The search results contain several relevant spans, particularly within the QuerySet and Collector classes in the django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py files, respectively. These spans include the QuerySet.delete method in query.py, which is responsible for initiating the delete operation and returning the result, and the Collector.delete method in deletion.py, which actually performs the deletion and aggregates the counts of deleted objects. Analyzing these spans reveals that the deletion logic could potentially be interfering with the result formatting, particularly in handling zero deletions. Based on this analysis, the identified relevant code spans involve the delete methods in both the QuerySet and Collector classes, as these are directly responsible for handling the deletion process and determining the output format.",
