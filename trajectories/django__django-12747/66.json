The `Collector.delete` span within `django/db/models/deletion.py` contains the logic for the actual deletion of objects and the computation of the result format, including the use of a `Counter` to track deletions. This is directly relevant as it involves the actual deletion process and result formulation. Similarly, the `QuerySet.delete` span within `django/db/models/query.py` is relevant as it initiates the deletion process through the use of a `Collector`.
