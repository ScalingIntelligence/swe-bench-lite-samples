The issue points out that when there are zero objects to delete, the result format differs based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. To address this, it's important to focus on the `QuerySet.delete()` method and the `Collector` class that is used within it. From the provided search results, two key sections of the code are identified as relevant: the `QuerySet.delete()` method in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `Collector.delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. These sections handle the deletion logic and the collection of objects to be deleted, respectively. Specifically, the `Collector.delete()` method seems to be responsible for the actual deletion and the return of the deletion results. The issue suggests that modifications are needed to ensure consistency in the result format regardless of whether there are foreign keys. Given the current code, it appears that the logic for determining the result format (especially when zero objects are deleted) is spread across these methods. Therefore, both sections of the code are relevant to the reported issue.",
