Specifically, the issue notes that the result format varies between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys when no objects are deleted, leading to an inconsistent output structure. The expected behavior is a consistent result format regardless of the model type. The analysis of the search results reveals several key code spans that are relevant to the issue. These include the implementation of the QuerySet.delete method, which is responsible for performing the deletion operation and returning the result, and the Collector class, which is used to manage and perform the actual deletion of objects. By examining these code spans, it is possible to see how the deletion process is handled and how the results are structured. Additionally, the search results include references to other methods like _raw_delete and update, but these are less directly related to the reported issue. The primary focus should be on understanding and potentially modifying the delete methods in QuerySet and Collector to ensure consistent result formatting when zero objects are deleted.",

The provided code segments show how the delete operation is handled, including the collection of objects to be deleted and the actual deletion process. The inconsistency mentioned in the issue, regarding the different return formats when zero objects are deleted, likely involves how the `deleted_counter` is constructed and returned in the `Collector.delete` method.
