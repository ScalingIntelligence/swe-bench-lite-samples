Specifically, the issue points out that when there are zero objects to delete, the result format differs based on whether the models have foreign keys or not. To address this, we need to identify the code spans that are responsible for handling the deletion process and returning the results. From the search results, the relevant code spans are within the `QuerySet` class, particularly the `_raw_delete` method, which performs the deletion operation. Additionally, the `delete` method in the `Model` class, which manages the deletion process and collects related objects for deletion, is relevant. These spans should be examined to determine how the result format is structured and modified to resolve the inconsistency.",

This covers the main aspects needed to address the reported issue regarding inconsistent results when zero objects are deleted. The Collector class is not directly included in the file context, but it is mentioned as being used in the Model class's delete method.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted\nDescription\n\t\nThe result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) \nX - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)\nY - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).\nExample: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})\nWhen there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:\nFor models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})\nFor \"simple\" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\nI would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n"
