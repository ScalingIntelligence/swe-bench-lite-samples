These methods handle the deletion of objects and are directly related to the reported issue.\n\n- `QuerySet.delete` handles the preparation and execution of the delete query.\n- `Collector.delete` is responsible for collecting and deleting the objects, and it returns the count of deleted objects and a dictionary with model labels and their respective delete counts.\n\nThe analysis of these methods indicates that the logic for handling deletions and the collection of results is well-defined but does not explicitly address the inconsistency mentioned in the issue.
