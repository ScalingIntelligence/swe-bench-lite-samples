The issue specifically notes that the result format should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys. The search results include relevant code spans from multiple files, particularly focusing on the implementation of the delete methods in Model, Collector, FieldFile, and QuerySet classes. These spans are crucial for understanding how the delete operation is handled and can be potentially modified to address the reported inconsistency. The spans include the initializations and deletions in Model and QuerySet classes, the deletion logic in the Collector class (which is used by the QuerySet.delete() method to handle deletions), and the specific delete methods in FieldFile and ImageFieldFile classes which handle file deletions. This comprehensive view of the deletion process across different components is necessary to ensure that any modifications made to address the inconsistency adhere to the existing logic and do not disrupt other functionalities. The identified spans thus provide a clear direction for addressing the issue, primarily focusing on the delete methods in QuerySet and Collector classes where the inconsistency in the results is most likely to be addressed.",

The issue is that for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is a tuple with an empty dictionary when no objects are deleted. However, for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple with a dictionary containing model-label keys and zero values. The expectation is for consistent behavior across both types of models.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans and search results, the main areas of concern seem to be the implementation of the delete() method in both QuerySet and Collector classes. The QuerySet.delete() method is responsible for delegating the delete operation to the Collector.\n\nIn the provided file_context, the 'QuerySet.delete()' method chain is seen outlining the deletion process. Additionally, the 'Collector.delete()' method is found to handle the actual deletion logic, including the counting of deleted objects and handling related objects.\n\nIn the search results, the 'Collector' class methods related to deletion are further examined. The 'Collector.delete()' methods give clear insights into the counting mechanisms of deleted objects. It also indicates that models' labeling and the number of deleted objects are stored in a Counter, which could be directly used or represent specific states such as an empty dictionary where a 'simple' model without foreign keys is found while mentioning variation from the 'models with foreign keys' go unnoticed.\n\nAn appropriate response could be suggesting that the variation present in models with foreign keys and simple models harden behind explicit consistency checks. Ensuring a comprehensive approach may facilitate finding and ceiling the original defect when fixing the 'models with foreign keys and bombs updating empty dictionaries replace third outcomes everywhere.'",
