The main concern is that the result for models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys should be consistent, either both yielding an empty dictionary or both yielding a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nThe relevant parts of the code can be found in two files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet.delete' method is responsible for handling the delete operation and returning the result. It uses a 'Collector' object to collect and delete instances.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'Collector.delete' method is where the actual deletion logic takes place. It sorts the instances to be deleted, handles pre_delete and post_delete signals, and updates the deleted_counter with the count of deleted instances. The logic for fast deletion and handling of dependencies is also addressed here.\n\nTo address the inconsistency issue, we should examine the 'Collector.delete' method, specifically where it checks for the length of self.data and instances. The current logic returns a tuple where the second element can either be an empty dictionary or a dictionary with zero values, thus causing the inconsistency reported.\n\nAnalyzing the code spans, the focus should be on the 'QuerySet.delete' and 'Collector.delete' methods, as these directly affect the result format returned by the delete operation.",

The logic for returning the deletion count and the dictionary of deleted objects per model is found in the `Collector` class's `delete()` method. The code currently does not differentiate between models with and without foreign keys in the case of zero deletions, indicating that the logic to handle the inconsistent result format is indeed present in the file context.
