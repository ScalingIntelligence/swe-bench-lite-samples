Specifically, it notes that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This inconsistency needs to be addressed. \n\nIn the provided context, the QuerySet.delete method is already identified and involves several steps, including setting up a Collector instance and using it to gather and delete objects. The Collector class appears to be the main entity responsible for collecting objects to be deleted and then performing the actual deletion. \n\nIn the new search results, the Collector class is further detailed with its methods such as __init__, collect, and delete. The delete method in Collector is particularly relevant as it determines the final output of the delete operation, which is a tuple containing the total number of deleted objects and a dictionary specifying the count of deletions per model. \n\nGiven these details, it appears that the behavior described in the issue could be influenced by how the deletion counter is handled in the Collector.delete method, especially when no objects are actually deleted. To address the issue, it may be necessary to ensure that the result format is consistent in both scenarios (with and without foreign keys), potentially by altering the way the deletion counter is initialized or updated. \n\nBased on this analysis, the most relevant file and spans are the delete method in both the QuerySet and the Collector classes, as they directly affect the output format.",
