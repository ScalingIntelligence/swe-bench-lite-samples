The file context provided includes the `delete` method of the `QuerySet` class and the `delete` method of the `Collector` class, which are central to handling the deletion logic. The `delete` method in `QuerySet` involves creating a `Collector` instance and collecting objects to be deleted. The `Collector`'s `delete` method then handles the actual deletion and returns a tuple containing the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary of model labels and their respective deletion counts. However, the provided file context does not specifically address the corner case of zero objects deleted, which is what the issue is concerned with. Given the scope of the provided code, it seems the relevant code handling the deletion logic is indeed captured, but it remains unclear how the method specifically handles the case when no objects are deleted across different types of models (with and without foreign keys). This suggests that further inspection or additional context might be necessary to determine if the method consistently returns an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.",
