To address this, I identified relevant code spans that deal with the deletion process in Django's ORM. These include the `delete` method in the `Model` class, the `delete` method in the `QuerySet` class, and the `delete` method in the `Collector` class. These methods are crucial as they handle the deletion logic and the return of deletion results. By analyzing these methods, I can determine how the deletion process is managed and how results are formatted, which will help in identifying the source of the inconsistency. Additionally, the `delete` methods in `FieldFile` and `ImageFieldFile` are identified as they handle file deletions, but they are not related to the main issue of result format inconsistency.",

The focus is on ensuring consistency in the returned tuple: (X, Y), where X is the total count of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary detailing the count of deleted objects per model. The issue highlights that when deleting zero objects, the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. To address this, it's crucial to review the delete methods in both QuerySet and Collector classes, as these are directly responsible for handling the deletion logic. The current search results reaffirm the presence of these methods in the codebase, specifically focusing on how they handle cases where no objects are deleted. This allows for an examination of the return statements and logic that constructs the deletion result. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant as they provide the necessary context to analyze and potentially rectify the inconsistent behavior described in the issue.

Specifically, the result format should be consistent whether models have foreign keys or not. Reviewing the provided file context, I identified the relevant parts in the `QuerySet`, `Model`, and `Collector` classes that handle the deletion process. The `delete` method in `QuerySet` is found in `django/db/models/query.py`, the `delete` method in `Model` is found in `django/db/models/base.py`, and the `delete` method in `Collector` is found in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. These methods involve the deletion logic, including the handling of zero objects deletion. Given the breadth of the issue and the detailed methods provided, it is reasonable to conclude that all relevant code is identified, even though direct checks for zero object deletions based on foreign key presence are not explicitly seen. Further details would likely involve more granular checks within these methods or additional related methods not included in the file context.",
