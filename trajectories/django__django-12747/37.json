The expected behavior is that there should be no difference between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys when no objects are deleted. The current behavior shows that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). To address this, it's crucial to identify the sections of code responsible for the deletion process in the QuerySet class and the Collector class. These sections include the 'QuerySet.delete' and 'Collector.delete' methods. By analyzing these methods, we can pinpoint where the inconsistency arises and understand how to rectify it. The 'QuerySet.delete' method initializes the deletion process and the 'Collector.delete' method executes the delete operation and returns the result which is likely where the inconsistency is occurring. The identified code spans will be from these methods.",

The delete method of the QuerySet class delegates deletion to the Collector, and the Collector's delete method provides the return value that is inconsistent. Despite the deepness of the code and potential complexity with multiple models and foreign keys, the provided file context captures the essential code to understand and potentially resolve the issue of inconsistent return values when zero objects are deleted.
