Specifically, the issue is that the result format differs between models with foreign keys and those without. To address this, we need to focus on the `delete` methods in the `QuerySet`, `Model`, and `Collector` classes, as these are involved in the deletion process. Analyzing the provided code spans, the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method are directly responsible for handling the bulk deletion of objects, which includes the logic for determining the result format. The `Model.delete` method also plays a role as it is called on individual instances and invokes the `Collector` for cascading deletions. These methods need to be inspected to ensure consistent handling of the result format when no objects are deleted. In particular, the `Collector.delete` method constructs the result tuple, and thus, modifications here would likely address the reported issue. The `FieldFile.delete` and `ImageFieldFile.delete` methods in `django/db/models/fields/files.py` are not relevant to the issue, as they deal with the deletion of file fields rather than the main deletion logic of model instances. Given these observations, the identified relevant code spans focus on the `delete` methods in `QuerySet`, `Model`, and `Collector`.",
