The issue identifies two cases where the result differs: one for models with foreign keys and another for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected outcome is uniformity in the result format. After reviewing the search results, I focused on the relevant spans within the 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py' files, as these contain methods directly related to the QuerySet and Model classes, both of which are central to the issue. I identified the 'QuerySet.delete' and the 'Model.delete' methods as key parts of the search results relevant to the issue. These methods are responsible for handling the deletion of objects, which is at the core of the reported inconsistency. The analysis also revealed that the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file might contain additional context for how deletions are compiled into SQL queries, which could also be relevant to understanding and resolving the issue. Given the complexity of the Django ORM and the fact that the issue spans both the QuerySet and individual Model deletions, these identified code spans are crucial for a comprehensive understanding and potential resolution of the issue.",
