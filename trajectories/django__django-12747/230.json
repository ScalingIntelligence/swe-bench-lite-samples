There are two cases mentioned: one for models with foreign keys and another for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is that both cases should return either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. The provided context suggests that the relevant code might reside in the delete method of the QuerySet class in the django/db/models/query.py file. Additionally, the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py might also be involved in the deletion process.",

The issue provides insights into the expected output format of the delete method and the inconsistencies faced when no objects are deleted. The key observations include: 1. When zero objects are deleted, the result should be a tuple (0, {}) for all models. However, for some models, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}), which is considered inconsistent. 2. The search results provide the implementation of the QuerySet.Delete method in the Django codebase, specifically in the file 'django/db/models/query.py'. This method is responsible for deleting objects from the database and returning the count of deleted objects and a dictionary of counters for each model. 3. By analyzing the 'QuerySet.Delete' span in the search results, it can be concluded that this span contains the relevant code. This span initializes a Collector object to handle the deletion of related objects, collects the objects to be deleted, and then performs the deletion. The result of the deletion operation is returned, which could be the source of the inconsistency described in the issue. 4. Furthermore, this analysis ensures that no other parts of the code in the provided spans seem to directly affect or be affected by this specific inconsistency in the delete method's result. Hence, it is sufficient to focus solely on the 'QuerySet.Delete' span to address the issue fully.",

It then uses a Collector instance to collect and subsequently delete the objects.

Considering this, I will analyze the provided file context and search results to identify the relevant code spans that handle the deletion process, specifically focusing on the 'delete' method in QuerySet and the 'delete' method in Collector, as well as related methods that determine the output format when no objects are deleted. Based on the provided context, the relevant spans are found in 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. The 'delete' method in QuerySet triggers the deletion through Collector, making the 'delete' method in Collector crucial for understanding where the result formatting occurs.

This method is responsible for deleting objects in the queryset. It constructs a del_query based on the current QuerySet, sets it for write operations, and clears any ordering. It then uses a Collector instance to collect and subsequently delete the objects. The delete method of the Collector class is called, and the result, including the number of deleted objects and a dictionary with model-label keys and their corresponding delete counts, is returned. This suggests that the Collector class and its methods, particularly 'collect' and 'delete', play a crucial role in handling the deletion process and determining the result format. To ensure consistent result formats, including for cases with zero objects deleted, investigating the methods (collect and delete) of the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py is essential. This information suggests that relevant files to investigate are django/db/models/query.py for the QuerySet class and django/db/models/deletion.py for the Collector class.",
