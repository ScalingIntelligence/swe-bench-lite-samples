This inconsistency is between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is that either both types of models return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. To address this, I will focus my search on the QuerySet class and its delete method in the django/db/models/query.py file, as well as the delete method in the Model class within django/db/models/base.py. Additionally, I will search for any related functions in django/db/models/deletion.py that might influence this behavior.",

Additionally, the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file contains the `Collector` class, which is responsible for collecting objects to be deleted and actually performing the delete operations. Relevant spans include `QuerySet.delete`, and within the `Collector` class, `delete` and `collect` methods are critical as they handle the core deletion logic and result formatting.
