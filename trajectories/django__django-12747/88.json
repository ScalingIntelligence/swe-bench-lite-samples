Specifically, it mentions that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is for both cases to be consistent, either both returning an empty dictionary or both returning a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. To investigate this, we should focus on the QuerySet.delete method and related classes that handle the deletion logic and result formatting, such as the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py and the delete method in django/db/models/query.py.",
