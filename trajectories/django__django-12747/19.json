To address this, we need to analyze the code related to the delete functionality in Django's ORM. The primary focus should be on the `QuerySet.delete`, `Model.delete`, and `Collector.delete` methods, as these are central to the deletion process. The `QuerySet.delete` method is responsible for handling the deletion of multiple objects, and it uses a `Collector` object to collect all related objects that need to be deleted. The `Collector.delete` method then performs the actual deletion and returns the count of deleted objects. The issue might be rooted in how these methods handle the case when there are zero objects to delete. Specifically, we need to check how the `deleted_counter` is initialized and updated in the `Collector.delete` method, as well as how the result tuple is constructed in both `Collector.delete` and `QuerySet.delete`. Additionally, the `DeleteQuery` and `SQLDeleteCompiler` classes are relevant as they deal with the SQL generation for the delete operation, which could also influence the result format. Given the provided code spans, the focus should be on the logic that constructs the return value for the delete operation in both `Collector.delete` and `QuerySet.delete`.",

The current context provides relevant sections within the Django codebase, primarily focusing on the `delete` method in `QuerySet`, `Model`, and the `Collector` class in `deletion.py`. These sections highlight the main logic for deletion, particularly in `Collector.delete`, which orchestrates the deletion process and constructs the deletion result tuple. The new search results further reinforce the understanding of the deletion logic, focusing on the `Collector.delete` method and the `SQLDeleteCompiler.as_sql` method, which is involved in compiling SQL queries for deletion. The key concern is ensuring that the dictionary part of the result tuple is consistently structured regardless of whether there are foreign keys involved or not when zero objects are deleted. The provided code spans from the search results do not introduce new functionalities directly relevant to resolving the issue's inconsistency but do reinforce the core understanding of how deletions are processed and counted in the Django ORM. As such, the current context, supplemented by the new search results, provides a comprehensive view of the deletion mechanism and the areas affected by the reported issue.",
