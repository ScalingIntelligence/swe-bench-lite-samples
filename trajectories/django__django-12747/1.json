To address this, we need to focus on how the delete method in both QuerySet and Collector classes handle this scenario. The QuerySet.delete method runs the main deletion logic through the Collector class and returns its result. The Collector collects objects for deletion, handles dependencies, and then executes actual deletions, returning the counts of deleted objects. Both QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete need to be examined to check how they handle empty deletions and if any inconsistency is addressed in their logic. The search results provide the necessary code spans, including QuerySet.delete, which delegates the actual deletion to the Collector, and the Collector.delete method that performs the actual deletion and counter calculations. These code spans are relevant as they directly implement the logic described in the reported issue. There aren't any references in the search results that suggest further search is needed beyond understanding these specific methods in the QuerySet and Collector classes.",
