Specifically, when there are zero objects to delete, the result should be consistent regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not. The expected result could either be an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nI analyzed the provided search results and found a relevant section of code in `django/db/models/deletion.py` under the span 'Collector.delete'. This section includes the logic for the delete function in the Collector class. The function processes the deletion of objects and returns a tuple with the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary specifying the count of deleted objects for each model. This is the critical part of the code that handles the deletion and should be reviewed to ensure consistent behavior when zero objects are deleted.\n\nThe code snippet checks if there is only one model and one instance to delete, and if so, it tries to perform a fast delete. If there are fast deletes, it processes them and updates the deleted_counter. It then iterates over the data and performs the deletion, updating the deleted_counter with the count of deleted objects for each model. Finally, it returns the sum of deleted_counter values and the dictionary of deleted_counter.\n\nI identified the relevant code spans that could lead to the inconsistency reported and should be checked and possibly modified to ensure consistent results when zero objects are deleted.",
