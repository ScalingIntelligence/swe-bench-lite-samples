Specifically, the issue highlights that the result format differs between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys when no objects are deleted. To address this, we need to examine the relevant code sections that handle the deletion process in Django's ORM.\n\nThe <search_results> section provides several key sections from the Django ORM codebase, including the QuerySet class and its delete method, the Collector class which is responsible for collecting objects for deletion, and the Model class which includes its own delete method. These sections are crucial for understanding how the deletion process is managed and how the results are formatted.\n\nIn the QuerySet.delete method, we see the method collects objects for deletion using the Collector class and then proceeds to delete them. The result of the deletion, including the counts of deleted objects, is returned. This method is directly relevant to the reported issue as it outlines how the deletion process is initiated and what data is returned.\n\nThe Collector class is also significant as it is responsible for collecting and managing the objects to be deleted. It includes methods for adding objects to the deletion list, managing dependencies, and actually performing the deletions. The Collector.delete method specifically handles the deletion process and returning the counts of deleted objects, making it crucial for addressing the inconsistency in results.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue. They provide the necessary context and functionality to understand and potentially rectify the issue related to inconsistent results when zero objects are deleted.",
