This inconsistency arises between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is that both cases should return the same result format, either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. Given the scope of the issue, the focus should be on the delete method within the QuerySet class and any associated logic within the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file, which contains the Collector class handling deletion logic.",

The `delete` method initializes the deletion process and interacts with the `Collector` to handle the actual deletion logic. The `collect` method within the `Collector` class is responsible for gathering objects to be deleted and managing related objects that should be deleted based on foreign key relationships. The issue suggests a need to ensure consistency in the result format when no objects are deleted, specifically when there are no foreign key relationships compared to when there are. To fix this, we need to ensure that the result format is always a tuple with a dictionary containing model labels and counts, even when the count is zero. Looking at the `delete` method in QuerySet, it calls `collector.delete()` and returns the result. The `collect` method in Collector should ensure that the counters for all relevant models are included in the result dictionary, setting them to zero if no objects are deleted. The identified spans in the `QuerySet` class (QuerySet.delete) and `Collector` class (Collector.collect) are relevant as they directly relate to the deletion process and will be key in addressing the reported issue.",
