Upon analysis of the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are located in two main files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. The 'QuerySet.delete' function in 'query.py' orchestrates the deletion process, while the 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py' handles the actual deletion and result formatting. The issue's key concern is addressed in the 'Collector.delete' method, which doesn't currently differentiate in the returned dictionary based on whether zero objects were deleted due to foreign key relations or simple deletions. It would require adjustments in this method and possibly in related parts of the collector's logic to ensure consistent handling of zero deletions. This encompasses understanding the addition of dependencies, collection methods, and delete operations, all of which play crucial roles in how the deletion logic is executed and results are formatted.",
