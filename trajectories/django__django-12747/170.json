The provided search results include the implementation of the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the Collector class in 'django/db/models/deletion.py', which manages the deletion process. These sections of code are directly relevant to the issue as they handle how objects are collected and deleted. The analysis of these code spans reveals that the behavior of the delete method and the Collector class can be inspected to ensure consistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted. Specifically, the delete method returns a tuple where the second element is a dictionary detailing the counts of deleted objects for each model. The Collector.delete method constructs this dictionary. Ensuring that this dictionary includes model-label keys with zero values for both types of models (with and without foreign keys) will address the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive basis for resolving the issue's concerns and need further inspection in the context of the issue.",

The `QuerySet.delete()` method involves the `Collector` class to perform the actual deletion of objects. However, the code snippets do not show explicit handling for zero deletions that could cause the inconsistencies described in the issue. It appears the `Collector.delete()` method uses a `Counter` to track deletions, but there isn't a specific check for when no objects are deleted to ensure consistent behavior. Further investigation might be needed to find where exactly this result formatting is managed when the count is zero, whether in the `Collector` class itself or another related part of the codebase.",

I have reviewed the context in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py, and the new search results. The relevant parts include QuerySet.delete, Collector.delete, and the specific logic in Collector for handling deletions, sorting collected objects, and implementing the delete operation. The issue might stem from how the collector handles the counting and tracking of deleted objects, especially in the absence of any objects to delete. Specifically, I should focus on the delete method in the Collector class to ensure that it consistently returns a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values for cases where no objects are deleted.",

Specifically, for models without foreign keys, the result is a tuple where the second element is a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values, whereas for models with foreign keys, the second element is an empty dictionary. The expected behavior is for both cases to return a result with an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nThe relevant sections of the codebase to address this issue are primarily in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. In `query.py`, the `QuerySet.delete` method is defined, which calls the `delete` method of the `Collector` class from `deletion.py`. The `Collector.delete` method is responsible for collecting and deleting the objects and returning the result.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant spans are:\n1. `QuerySet.delete` in `django/db/models/query.py`, which initializes the deletion process.\n2. `Collector.delete` in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, which handles the actual deletion and returns the deletion result.\n\nThese spans are sufficient to understand the current logic of the `QuerySet.delete` method and propose modifications to ensure consistent results for both models with and without foreign keys.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted\nDescription\n\t\nThe result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) \nX - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)\nY - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).\nExample: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})\nWhen there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:\nFor models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})\nFor \"simple\" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\nI would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n"
