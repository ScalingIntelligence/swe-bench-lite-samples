The DeleteQuery and SQLDeleteCompiler classes demonstrate how the actual SQL operation is performed, which is crucial for understanding the behavior with respect to the issue at hand. Particularly, the SQLDeleteCompiler's as_sql method directly affects how the SQL is constructed and executed, which can either result in an empty dictionary or a dictionary with zero values for each model, depending on the presence of foreign keys.
