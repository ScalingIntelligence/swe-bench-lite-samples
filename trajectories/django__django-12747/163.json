The analysis of the search results involves examining the QuerySet class in the django/db/models/query.py file and the Query class in the django/db/models/sql/query.py file.\n\nIn the QuerySet class, the 'QuerySet.delete' span is particularly relevant as it pertains to the delete method which is the focus of the issue. The method 'QuerySet.delete' is responsible for deleting objects and returning the counts of deleted objects. This method collects the objects to be deleted and then calls the 'delete()' method of the collector which returns the counts of deleted objects. This is the main code that performs the delete operation which should be inspected to address the inconsistency.\n\nAdditionally, the method '_raw_delete' is also relevant as it performs a raw delete operation bypassing some of the Django ORM operations, and understanding its implementation can provide insights into different approaches to deleting objects.\n\nConsidering the provided search results and the nature of the reported issue, it is evident that the issue lies within the 'QuerySet.delete' method concerning how it handles zero objects deletion scenarios.

The `delete` method in QuerySet does not directly handle the case when no objects are deleted.

The focus should be on the logic that determines the structure of the return value when no objects are deleted. From the search results, I see that the `delete` method in the `Collector` class constructs a `Counter` object named `deleted_counter` to keep track of the number of objects deleted per model. This counter is then used to return the total count of deleted objects and a dictionary with model labels and their respective delete counts. This method does not explicitly handle the case when no objects are deleted, which could lead to inconsistencies as reported.

Specifically, the issue notes that for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple with an empty dictionary (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign key, the result includes a dictionary with model-label keys and zero value (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy suggests a bug in the code that handles these cases differently. I reviewed the provided code spans and found relevant sections in both 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'query.py', the 'delete' method of the 'QuerySet' class is responsible for initiating the deletion process and specifying how the results should be returned. Within 'deletion.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Collector' class performs the actual deletion and constructs the results. I identified the code spans that indicate how the deletion process is handled and how the results are formatted and returned. These spans show the logic used to count deleted objects and build the result tuple based on the deleted counts. Given the discrepancy noted in the issue, it appears that the logic for determining whether to include model labels in the result dictionary might be flawed, especially when there are zero objects to delete. The additional search results confirm the presence of both sections of code, and the 'Collector.delete' method can be flagged for closer inspection due to its direct involvement in constructing the deletion result tuple. I recommend reviewing the 'Collector.delete' method particularly in how it handles cases with zero deleted objects and the logic around including or excluding model labels in the resulting dictionary to address the reported issue.",
