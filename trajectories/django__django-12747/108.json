Specifically, it mentions that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy needs to be addressed by ensuring consistent results in both cases. The provided search results include several key sections that are relevant to this issue:\n1. django/db/models/base.py - This file contains the Model class, including the Model.delete method. This method is responsible for deleting individual model instances.\n2. django/db/models/deletion.py - This file contains the Collector class, which is used by the Model.delete method and the QuerySet.delete method to collect and delete model instances. The Collector.delete method is particularly relevant as it handles the actual deletion process.\n3. django/db/models/query.py - This file contains the QuerySet class, including the QuerySet.delete method. This method is used to delete multiple instances and uses the Collector class for the deletion process.\n4. django/db/models/fields/files.py - This file contains the FieldFile and ImageFieldFile classes, including their delete methods. While these are related to file handling, they demonstrate how delete methods can be implemented in Django, which might be relevant for understanding similar methods in other contexts.\nThese sections provide a comprehensive view of the delete functionality in Django, including how instances are collected and deleted, and how the results are structured. This context is crucial for addressing the reported issue.",
