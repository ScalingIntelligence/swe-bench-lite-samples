Specifically, the issue points out that when there are zero objects to delete, the result format varies based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. The expected behavior is that both cases should return either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nIn the search results, we find two relevant files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'query.py', the 'QuerySet.delete' method is defined, which calls the 'Collector.delete' method from 'deletion.py'.\n\nIn 'deletion.py', the 'Collector' class and its 'delete' method are crucial. This method collects and deletes objects, returning a counter of deleted objects for each model. The issue suggests that modifications in this method might resolve the inconsistency problem.\n\nThus, the identified spans include the 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'query.py' and the 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py'. These are the key parts of the codebase that need to be examined and potentially modified to address the issue.",
