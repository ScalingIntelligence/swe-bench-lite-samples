This issue can be addressed by examining the code for both the Collector.delete method and the QuerySet.delete method. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. QuerySet.Delete Method:\n   - The method sets up the deletion process and uses a Collector to collect and delete objects.\n   - Relevant portion: 'def delete(self):' block, which initializes the deletion process.\n\n2. Collector.Delete Method:\n   - This method handles the actual deletion and returns the result.\n   - Relevant portion: 'def delete(self):' block, which includes the main deletion logic and return statement.\n   - The method should be inspected for how it handles cases where zero objects are deleted, particularly across models with and without foreign keys.\n\nBy focusing on these two methods, we can identify the source of the inconsistency and determine if further adjustments are needed to ensure consistent behavior across all models.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted\nDescription\n\t\nThe result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) \nX - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)\nY - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).\nExample: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})\nWhen there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:\nFor models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})\nFor \"simple\" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\nI would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n"
