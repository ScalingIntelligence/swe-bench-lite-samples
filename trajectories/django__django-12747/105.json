The current behavior seems to be that for models with foreign keys, the result tuple is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The goal is to make the result consistent across both cases. \n\nFrom the search results, the Collector.delete method is where we should focus, as it is responsible for the actual deletion process and the generation of the result tuple. The current implementation of Collector.delete method appears to be where the inconsistency might be arising from, particularly when handling models with and without foreign keys. By carefully examining this method, we should be able to pinpoint where the conditional logic might be leading to different results based on the presence or absence of foreign keys.",
