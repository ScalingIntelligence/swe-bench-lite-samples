Specifically, the issue points out that the result format varies based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. I will analyze the provided search results to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the QuerySet.Delete method and the Collector class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting objects. From the search results, I see that the QuerySet.delete method is defined in the 'django/db/models/query.py' file, and it relies on the Collector class from 'django/db/models/deletion.py' to perform the actual deletion. The 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file contains the implementation of the Collector class, and specifically the 'Collector.delete' method is of interest as it constructs the result format of the deletion operation. Additionally, the 'QuerySet.delete' method itself in the 'django/db/models/query.py' file will be relevant since it returns the result of the Collector's delete operation. Furthermore, the 'django/db/models/base.py' file contains the implementation of the Model.delete method which also uses the Collector.",

These classes and methods are central to handling deletions in Django, including the logic for deleting zero objects and managing the result format of deletions. Given the issue's description of inconsistencies in the result format of `QuerySet.delete` when zero objects are deleted, and the provided context including `QuerySet`, `Collector`, and `Model` classes with their respective delete methods, I believe the relevant file context has been provided to address the issue. Specifically, the logic around how deletions are counted and reported, particularly when handling zero deletions, is present in the `Collector.delete` method. This enables addressing the described inconsistency regarding the result format. Therefore, I conclude that the relevant code has been identified, and the task can be marked as complete.",
