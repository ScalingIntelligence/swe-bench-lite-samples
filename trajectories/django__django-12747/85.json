Specifically, the issue highlights that for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure consistency in the result format across different models.\n\nThe provided search results include two key files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'query.py', the relevant code span is the 'delete' method of the QuerySet class. This method sets up the deletion process and delegates it to the Collector class in 'deletion.py'.\n\nIn 'deletion.py', the 'delete' method of the Collector class is analyzed. This method is responsible for handling the actual deletion of objects and constructing the deletion result tuple. The inconsistent behavior described in the issue is likely to be managed in this method where the deletion counter is constructed. Specifically, the block of code where 'deleted_counter' is initialized and updated appears to be the section where the inconsistency might need adjustment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to address the inconsistency issue reported.",

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted\nDescription\n\t\nThe result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) \nX - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)\nY - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).\nExample: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})\nWhen there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:\nFor models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})\nFor \"simple\" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\nI would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n"
