The expected behavior is that the result format should be consistent regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans seem to be in the QuerySet class within the `django/db/models/query.py` file. Specifically, the `delete()` method in the QuerySet class is the primary focus. This method is responsible for handling the deletion of objects and returning the result in the format described in the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the `Collector.delete()` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file is also relevant. The Collector class is used by the QuerySet.delete() method to collect and then delete the objects, encompassing related objects as well. The result format of the Collector.delete() method (a tuple: total count of deleted objects and a dictionary of model labels with their corresponding deleted counts) directly affects the output of the QuerySet.delete() method.\n\nThe `DeleteQuery` class in the `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py` file is less directly relevant, as it is an implementation detail for executing the SQL delete statements and not directly related to the result format when zero objects are deleted.\n\nThe issue highlights a potential bug where the format differs for models with and without foreign keys when no objects are deleted. The relevant code spans provided are sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue by ensuring consistency in the result format across these different cases.",
