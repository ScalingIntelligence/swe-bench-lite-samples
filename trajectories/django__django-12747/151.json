The issue highlights that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). To address this, we need to focus on the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method since these are directly responsible for the deletion process. From the search results, we identify the relevant code spans within these methods that dictate how the deletion process occurs and how the results are formatted. Specifically, we need to look at how the deleted object counts are calculated and returned. The `QuerySet.delete` method calls the `Collector.delete` method, which is where the actual deletion logic resides and the counts are computed. By examining these methods, we can understand the logic behind returning the counts and potentially identify the source of the inconsistency highlighted in the issue.",

Specifically, the delete method in the QuerySet class delegates the actual deletion process to the Collector class. The Collector's delete method constructs the result tuple that includes the count of deleted objects and a dictionary with model-specific counts. This code seems to cover the aspects necessary to address the inconsistency issue described, particularly in how the result tuple is built. However, detailed examination of how the dictionary is populated when no objects are deleted (especially for models with and without foreign keys) would be required to fully confirm if the issue is addressed. The current code shows that it uses a Counter to keep track of deleted objects per model, and this mechanism should be consistent regardless of the presence of foreign keys.",
