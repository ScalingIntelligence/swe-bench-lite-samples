There are two scenarios: (1) When there are foreign keys involved, the result is (0, {}), and (2) When there are no foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.Model': 0}). The expected behavior is for both scenarios to return results that either both have an empty dictionary or both have a dictionary with model-label keys and a zero value. To address this, we need to investigate and potentially modify the delete method in the QuerySet class and related deletion handling code in Django's Model classes and SQL compilation. I will focus the search on the delete method in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/base.py, as these files contain the relevant methods.",
