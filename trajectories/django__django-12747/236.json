The expected behavior is to have consistent results for both cases, either both with an empty dictionary or both with a dictionary containing model-label keys and zero values.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans that are directly related to the issue. The QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' shows the implementation of the delete method, which uses the Collector to collect and delete objects. The Collector class in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' contains methods responsible for collecting objects and performing the actual deletion. The delete method within the Collector class is particularly relevant as it returns the counts of deleted objects.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the relevant code spans in 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py' are the ones defining the delete method in both QuerySet and Collector classes.
