The issue states that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy needs to be addressed. The relevant code spans are identified in the QuerySet class within django/db/models/query.py, specifically the 'QuerySet.delete' span. This span covers the implementation of the delete method in the QuerySet class, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'Collector' class in django/db/models/deletion.py is identified as relevant because it is used by the delete method to perform the actual deletion of objects and return the deletion counts. The 'Collector.delete' span is particularly relevant as it handles the final deletion and returns the deletion counts, which can be modified to ensure consistent results. Lastly, the 'Model.delete' span in django/db/models/base.py is identified as it provides the delete method at the model level, which interacts with the Collector class. This method sets up the deletion process for individual model instances. These spans collectively provide the necessary context to understand the deletion process and how to adjust it to ensure consistent results when zero objects are deleted.",
