The issue describes two cases: one where models have foreign keys and another where they do not, leading to different result formats when no objects are deleted. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle the deletion process and determine how the result format is constructed.\n\nIn the provided search results, we find the implementation of the Collector and QuerySet classes, which are crucial for understanding how deletions are handled. The `Collector.delete` function is especially relevant as it contains logic for counting and deleting objects, and constructing the result tuple. It uses a `Counter` to keep track of deleted objects per model and constructs the result tuple accordingly. The `QuerySet.delete` function calls `collector.delete()` to perform the deletion and returns its result.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in `deletion.py` and `query.py` are directly related to the issue, as they handle the counting and deletion of objects, which determine the result format. These spans should be examined further during the debugging or implementation of the solution to ensure consistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted.",
