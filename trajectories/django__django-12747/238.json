The primary concern is that the result format differs based on whether the model has foreign keys or not. To address this, we need to analyze the code responsible for the delete operation in both the QuerySet and the Collector classes. The search results provide crucial insights into how the delete operation is implemented, particularly focusing on the 'delete' method in the QuerySet class and the 'delete' method in the Collector class. The QuerySet.delete method is responsible for initiating the delete operation, while the Collector.delete method handles the actual deletion process, including the counting of deleted objects and the handling of foreign keys. By examining these methods, we can pinpoint the section of the code that needs adjustment to ensure consistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted, regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. This involves understanding how the deleted_counter is handled and how the result tuple is constructed.",
