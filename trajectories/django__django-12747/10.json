This method controls the actual deletion process, including how the deletion counts are accumulated and returned. The second relevant section is the 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'django/db/models/query.py'. This method initiates the deletion process by using the Collector. I reviewed both sections of the code and decided that they are directly related to the issue because they handle the deletion logic and the count aggregation, which is the core of the reported inconsistency.

The `Collector.delete` method seems to construct the result format based on the number of objects deleted. To address the inconsistency issue, we should focus on how the result is constructed especially when zero objects are deleted. Specifically, we should look into the logic within the `Collector.delete` method that handles the counting of deleted objects and the construction of the result dictionary.

The `Collector.delete` method constructs the result format and could be modified to ensure consistency.
