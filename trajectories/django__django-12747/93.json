Specifically, for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {'model_label': 0}). The expected behavior is for the result to be consistent across both cases.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans are located in the django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py files. The QuerySet.delete method is found in the query.py file, and the Collector.delete method is located in the deletion.py file. These methods are responsible for the deletion logic and the result formatting.\n\nThe QuerySet.delete method initializes the deletion process and calls the Collector's collect and delete methods. The Collector.delete method handles the actual deletion and constructs the result tuple. Analyzing these methods reveals that the inconsistency arises because the deletion logic treats models with foreign keys differently from 'simple' models. This difference in handling results in the observed inconsistency.\n\nIdentifying the code spans related to the QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete methods is crucial for addressing the reported issue. These spans capture the core logic responsible for the deletion behavior and result formatting.",
