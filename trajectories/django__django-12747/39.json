The expectation is that the result format should be consistent regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not. To address this, it's important to investigate the `delete` method in the `QuerySet` class and potentially related classes handling deletion logic, such as `DeleteQuery` and `Collector`. The focus should be on understanding how the result format is determined when no objects are deleted and identifying any conditional logic that might be causing the inconsistency.",

The expected behavior is to have a consistent result format for both models with or without foreign keys. Based on the search results, the relevant code spans to address this issue are found in the 'QuerySet.delete' method within 'django/db/models/query.py' where the delete operation is defined for QuerySet. This method handles the deletion of selected objects and returns the count of deleted objects and a dictionary of counts per model. Additionally, the 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is relevant as it manages the collection and deletion of objects. These methods need to ensure that when no objects are deleted, the result format remains consistent, addressing the reported issue.",

These methods are used to control how the deletion process happens, including handling foreign keys and collecting results. The `delete` method in `QuerySet` sets up the deletion query and processes the results, adjusting for cases with zero deleted objects. Similarly, the `Collector` class aggregates the objects to be deleted, processes deletions, handles signals, and collects the counts. Despite the inclusion of these core methods, I am unable to definitively see the specific conditional logic that is causing the inconsistency mentioned in the issue regarding zero deletions when objects with foreign keys versus simple models are concerned. Given the complexity of these methods and the detailed nature of the inconsistency described in the issue, it would be prudent to dive deeper into the specific conditional logic that dictates the format of the deletion results when no objects are deleted, possibly checking other linked classes or additional Django core files if necessary, to ensure no further relevant code is missed.",

The expected behavior is that both cases should return either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nIn the provided search results, I identified that both the QuerySet.delete() method and the Collector.delete() method are relevant to this issue. The QuerySet.delete() method is responsible for initiating the delete operation, and the Collector.delete() method is responsible for collecting and deleting the objects.\n\nIn the initial file context, the QuerySet.delete() method was already identified as relevant, and in the search results, the Collector.delete() method is also seen as important because it handles the actual deletion logic and returns the result tuple. Additionally, the DeleteQuery.delete_batch() method in subqueries.py is relevant as it performs the batch deletion and returns the number of deleted objects.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans are:\n- QuerySet.delete() in django/db/models/query.py\n- Collector.delete() in django/db/models/deletion.py\n- DeleteQuery.delete_batch() in django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py\nThese spans cover the key parts of the code that handle the deletion logic and return the result format.",

The expected behavior is for both cases to either have the empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nTo address this, we need to focus on the `QuerySet.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method as these are responsible for determining the deletion logic and result format. The relevant code spans in the provided search results include:\n\n1. `QuerySet.delete` in django/db/models/query.py - This method initializes the deletion process and uses the `Collector` class to collect and delete objects.\n2. `Collector.delete` in django/db/models/deletion.py - This method handles the actual deletion of objects and constructs the result tuple (X, Y).\n3. `DeleteQuery.delete_batch` in django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py - This method is responsible for batch deletions, which is relevant for determining the number of deleted objects.\n\nBy analyzing these spans, we can identify how the deletion counts and the result dictionary are constructed.
