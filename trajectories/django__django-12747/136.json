            "scratch_pad": "In order to address the reported issue regarding the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.Delete method when zero objects are deleted, it is necessary to examine the code responsible for the delete operation. The issue describes that the result format varies depending on whether the models have foreign keys or not. The expected behavior is that either both situations should return an empty dictionary or both should return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided search results, the following key areas are identified as relevant:\n\n1. The `QuerySet.delete` method in `django/db/models/query.py` - This method is responsible for handling the delete operation for QuerySet objects. The method constructs a `Collector` object and calls its `delete` method to perform the actual deletion.\n\n2. The `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` - This method contains the logic for collecting and deleting objects, including the handling of model dependencies and sending signals before and after deletion. The method also constructs the result tuple which contains the total number of deleted objects and a dictionary with counters for each model.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, these two methods are critical to resolving the inconsistency. By focusing on these sections, we can evaluate and potentially modify the behavior to ensure consistency across different model types when no objects are deleted.\n\nFurthermore, the `Collector.delete` method should be particularly scrutinized to ensure that the dictionary of deleted objects is consistently formed regardless of whether foreign keys are involved or not. This might involve adjusting how the counter is initialized or updated when no deletions occur.\n\nThese findings are based on the observation that the code provided in the `delete` methods directly handles the results and the format of the response, making it the logical place to start when addressing this issue.\n\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that understanding the broader context of the delete operation, including how model dependencies are managed and how signals are sent, is crucial to ensuring any changes made do not inadvertently affect other parts of the system. Therefore, while the identified spans are crucial, a comprehensive understanding of the Django ORM's deletion process is recommended before finalizing any modifications.",
