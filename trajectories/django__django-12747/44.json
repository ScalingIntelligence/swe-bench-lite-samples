There are two scenarios: one for models with foreign keys and another for 'simple' models without foreign keys. The goal is to find the exact place in the codebase where this behavior is implemented so that it can be fixed to ensure consistency across all cases. The relevant files include those related to deletion logic in Django's ORM, such as 'deletion.py' for the deletion collector logic and 'query.py' for the QuerySet class. The specific method to focus on is 'delete' within the QuerySet class.",

This problem pertains to the handling of the result tuple when no objects are deleted, specifically the difference between models with foreign keys and those without. The primary focus is on the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector class used within it, as well as the handling of the results upon deletion.\n\nUpon examining the search results, the relevant code spans can be found in the django/db/models/query.py file, specifically within the QuerySet class, and in the django/db/models/deletion.py file, within the Collector class. Also, there is a reference to the Model class delete method in django/db/models/base.py for context on how deletions are initiated for individual model instances.\n\nThe QuerySet.delete method is critical as it orchestrates the deletion process, including gathering all objects for deletion and handling their cascading effects. The Collector.delete method is where the actual deletion occurs and the result is formatted, making it essential for fixing the reported issue related to the result format when no objects are deleted. These sections of code directly relate to the mentioned problem and are likely candidates for modifications to ensure consistent result formatting in all deletion cases.",

The current implementation in `django/db/models/deletion.py` uses a `Counter` named `deleted_counter` to keep track of the number of objects deleted for each model. The existing logic already accounts for cases where no objects are deleted by initializing `deleted_counter` with a `Counter`, which inherently handles zero counts correctly. However, there might be a need to explicitly handle the case where no objects are deleted to ensure that the result is a consistent tuple, either `(0, {})` or `(0, {'model_name': 0})`. This can be achieved by adding a check at the end of the `delete` method to ensure that if `deleted_counter` is empty, it explicitly returns a tuple with zero deleted objects and an empty dictionary or a dictionary with zero counts for the involved models.",
