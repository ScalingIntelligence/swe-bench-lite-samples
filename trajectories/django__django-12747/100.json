It's crucial to identify where the logic for deleting objects is set and how the result format is determined for each type of model. Therefore, the main focus will be on the 'delete' function within the QuerySet class, the Collector class responsible for collecting objects to delete, and possibly the DeleteQuery class for SQL-level deletions.",

Given the issue description, the main areas of interest are the delete methods within QuerySet, Model, and Collector classes. The QuerySet.delete() method initiates the deletion process, which involves the Collector class to manage and execute the deletions across different models. The Model.delete() method ensures that the deletion logic is applied consistently to individual model instances.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. 'QuerySet.delete': This span contains the implementation of the delete method for the QuerySet class, which is responsible for handling bulk deletions of multiple objects.\n2. 'Model.delete': This span outlines the implementation of the delete method for the Model class, which handles the deletion of individual model instances, though in the context of the reported issue, it may not be directly addressed.\n3. 'Collector.delete': This span is critical as it defines how deletions are collected and executed across different models, and how the results are formatted, which directly relates to the inconsistency reported in the issue.\n\nThese spans provide the necessary context to understand and address the issue. The 'Collector.delete' method, in particular, needs careful inspection to ensure that when zero objects are deleted, the result format is consistent and does not depend on whether the models have foreign keys. This involves checking how the method collects and counts the deletions and formats the return tuple.",
