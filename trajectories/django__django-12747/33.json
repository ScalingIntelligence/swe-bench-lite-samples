To identify relevant code spans, I have examined the provided search results. Key areas to focus on are the Collector.delete and QuerySet.delete methods as they handle the deletion process and return the deletion results. In the Collector.delete method, the handling of deleted objects and the return of deletion counts and labels are crucial. The QuerySet.delete method mainly involves preparing the deletion query and collecting data before triggering the deletion through the Collector. Given the complexity of the deletion process, the current code spans appear relevant for addressing the reported issue. Therefore, the search task has yielded relevant and comprehensive code spans to address the issue.",
