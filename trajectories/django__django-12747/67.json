Specifically, the issue points out that the result varies depending on whether the models have foreign keys or not. To address this, we need to examine the relevant methods that handle the deletion logic in the provided search results. The key sections to look for are the __init__ and delete methods of QuerySet, Collector, and Model classes. I notice that there is an inconsistency in the return format between models with foreign keys and 'simple' models without foreign keys. Ideally, the return format for both cases should be consistent. The provided code spans contain the essential logic for deletion which includes collecting the objects to be deleted in the Collector class and executing the deletion using the delete method in the QuerySet class which in turn delegates the actual deletion to the Collector. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans are the ones that involve the deletion process and the return format of the delete method in the QuerySet and Collector classes.",
