The expected behavior is for the result to be consistent, either with an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. Based on the description, it is essential to specifically look into the QuerySet class and its delete method, as well as the Collector class in the deletion process. Additionally, reviewing the DeleteQuery class in the subqueries module may also be beneficial to understand the query execution during deletions.",

Specifically, there is a difference in the returned tuple depending on whether the model had foreign keys or not. The goal is to have consistent results in both cases.\n\nI first analyzed the QuerySet.delete method in django/db/models/query.py to understand its current implementation and how it interacts with the Collector class. This method initializes a Collector, collects the objects to be deleted, and then calls the Collector's delete method to perform the deletion and return the deletion results.\n\nNext, I examined the Collector.delete method in django/db/models/deletion.py. This method is responsible for actually deleting the objects and returning the counts of deleted objects. It uses a Counter to keep track of the number of objects deleted for each model.\n\nAn important observation is that the delete method in the Collector class checks if there's exactly one model with one instance and if fast deletion is possible. If so, it performs a more straightforward deletion process and returns a count of the deleted objects using the model's label. However, for more complex cases, it uses a more detailed approach, which respects foreign key relationships and aggregates results before returning. This part of the code likely contributes to the inconsistency described in the issue.\n\nI also checked the DeleteQuery class in django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py to understand how it performs the actual SQL delete operations, but it does not seem to directly influence the result format inconsistency issue.\n\nBased on my analysis, the relevant code spans are in the QuerySet.delete method under django/db/models/query.py and the Collector.delete method under django/db/models/deletion.py. These methods must be modified to ensure consistent result formatting when zero objects are deleted.",
