To address this, the relevant sections of code need to be identified from the provided search results. The QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' is a key part of the Django ORM handling record deletion and is directly related to the issue. This method interacts with the Collector class in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' to perform the actual deletion and result collation. The Collector class contains the logic for collecting objects to be deleted and counting the deletions per model. It uses a combination of defaultdict for storing data and Counter for counting the deletions, which is essential for understanding the current behavior and potentially modifying it to achieve consistency. By closely examining these spans, we can determine where the inconsistencies arise and plan modifications to ensure uniform result formatting regardless of the presence of foreign keys. This involves analyzing both the main deletion logic in QuerySet.delete and the detailed deletion and counting mechanisms in the Collector class. Based on this analysis, the identified spans are crucial for addressing the issue at hand.",

These sections appear to handle the deletion logic, including how the deletion result is formatted and returned. The issue suggests that the result format varies depending on whether there are zero objects to delete and whether those objects have foreign keys. Examining the code, I see that it collects objects to delete, sorts them, and then proceeds with the deletion, updating counters as needed. The current implementation does not explicitly handle the case of zero deletions in a consistent manner as described in the issue. Therefore, if the goal is to ensure consistency for zero deletions, further modifications will be necessary within these sections of code.
