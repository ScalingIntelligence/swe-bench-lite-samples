The expected behavior across all types of models is that the result should either be a tuple with an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values, without distinction between models with foreign keys and those without. The current implementation shows different behaviors for these two cases. The relevant code spans to address this issue are found in two files: `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/query.py`. In `deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method handles the deletion logic, and it's where the inconsistency likely originates. The `delete` method in `query.py` calls `Collector.delete` during the deletion process. Specifically, the sections of the `Collector.delete` method are relevant as they manage the counting of deleted objects and return the tuple format. These sections include handling fast deletes, tracking deleted objects per model, and sending pre_delete and post_delete signals. It's also worth noting that filtering and handling zero objects deleted will need specific attention to ensure consistent results. The `QuerySet.delete` method in `query.py` is responsible for setting up and initiating the deletion process and includes validation checks that are relevant to a full understanding of the deletion process.",
