The key expectation is that the result format should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not. The relevant code spans are identified from the Django source code that handle the deletion process. These include the delete method in the QuerySet class and the Collector class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting objects, as well as the delete method in the Model class, which initiates the deletion process for the instance. The SQLDeleteCompiler class is also reviewed as it is involved in compiling SQL statements for deletions, which could impact the result formatting. However, the issue does not directly relate to SQL compilation but how the deletion results are assembled and returned. Therefore, the most relevant code spans are those in django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/deletion.py where the logic for deleting objects and returning results is implemented.
