The 'Model.delete' method, in 'django/db/models/base.py', shows the initial setup and collection for deletion. The 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' provides the deletion logic for collected instances, which is crucial for understanding the deletion process and the counters involved. Lastly, the 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'django/db/models/query.py' orchestrates the overall deletion process by invoking the Collector and handling the results.
