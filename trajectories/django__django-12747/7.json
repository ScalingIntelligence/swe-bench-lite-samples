The search results provide crucial insights into the implementation of the delete functionality in Django's ORM. The Collector class in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is responsible for collecting objects to be deleted and handles the actual deletion process. The delete method in this class is particularly relevant as it manages the deletion of objects and the generation of the deletion results. The Counter used in this method to keep track of deleted objects and their counts aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the QuerySet class in 'django/db/models/query.py' defines the delete method used to trigger the deletion process, which interacts with the Collector. By examining these code spans, it is clear that they are directly related to the reported issue, as they handle the deletion logic and the result formatting.",
