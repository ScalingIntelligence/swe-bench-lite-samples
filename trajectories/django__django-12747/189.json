The expectation is to have a consistent result format regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not. The key elements to focus on are the `QuerySet.delete`, `Model.delete`, and `Collector.delete` methods. From the search results, we can see that the `QuerySet.delete` method calls the `Collector.collect` and `Collector.delete` methods. The `Model.delete` method also calls the `Collector.collect` method. The `Collector.delete` method handles the actual deletion process, including the counting and reporting of deleted objects. The code spans identified cover the initiation of the deletion process, the collection of objects to be deleted, and the execution of the deletion, which includes counting and reporting the deleted objects.

  "initial_message": "QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted\nDescription\n\t\nThe result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) \nX - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)\nY - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).\nExample: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})\nWhen there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:\nFor models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})\nFor \"simple\" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\nI would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n"
