The provided search results include two key files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'query.py', the 'delete' method of the QuerySet class is found, which is responsible for processing and returning the delete results. This method uses a 'Collector' class from 'deletion.py' to collect and delete the objects. The 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py' implements the deletion logic and returns the count of deleted objects for each model. It is here that the inconsistency mentioned in the issue might be addressed or further investigated. Given this analysis, both the 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'query.py' and the 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py' are relevant to the reported issue.",
