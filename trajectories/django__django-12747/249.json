There are two specific cases mentioned: one where there are foreign keys, and the other where there are no foreign keys. Both should ideally return the same result format. After examining the provided code, it is evident that the issue is related to the implementation of the delete method in the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py. This method is responsible for handling the deletion of objects and returning the result tuple (X, Y). The analysis of the code shows that the delete method calls the collector.collect() and collector.delete() methods to gather and delete objects, respectively. The inconsistency could arise from how the collector handles cases where there are no objects to delete, especially concerning foreign keys. Identifying these sections of code is crucial to address the reported issue.

The `Collector` class's `delete` method uses a `Counter` to keep track of deleted objects by model label, which could contribute to the observed inconsistency. Given that the core functionality related to deletion is present in the file context, it suggests that other parts of the codebase may need to be reviewed to ensure consistency in deletion results.",
