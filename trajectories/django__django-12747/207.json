Specifically, it notes that the format differs between models with and without foreign keys when no objects are deleted. To resolve this, we need to identify where the delete operation logic is implemented and ensure consistent result formatting. The relevant files and code snippets provided suggest that the `delete` method and related logic are spread across several files. I will therefore search for the `delete` method implementations across these files to pinpoint the relevant logic and determine the exact location of the inconsistency.",

Specifically, it mentions that for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy needs to be addressed. \n\nThe current file context already provides relevant code spans from django/db/models/query.py, django/db/models/base.py, and django/db/models/deletion.py. These spans include the QuerySet.delete method, the Model.delete method, and the Collector.delete method, all of which are critical for understanding how the delete operation is managed. \n\nThe new search results contain additional code from django/db/models/deletion.py, focusing on the Collector class and its delete method. This method is responsible for managing the deletion of objects by collecting them, sorting them based on dependencies, and then performing the actual deletion. The presence of the Collector.delete method in the search results reinforces its importance in resolving the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified relevant code spans are in django/db/models/query.py (for QuerySet.delete), django/db/models/base.py (for Model.delete), and django/db/models/deletion.py (for Collector.delete). These spans need to be inspected to determine if they handle the case of zero objects being deleted consistently.",
