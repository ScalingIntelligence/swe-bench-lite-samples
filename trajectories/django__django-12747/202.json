Specifically, the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' is responsible for initiating the delete operation and returning the result. The Collector.delete method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' contains the logic for collecting and deleting objects, including the handling of foreign keys and generating the result tuple. These code spans are directly related to the issue as they outline how deletions are processed and results are formatted. The Model.delete method in 'django/db/models/base.py' is also relevant as it initiates the deletion process for individual model instances but does not directly address the inconsistency in result formatting when zero objects are deleted.
