Specifically, the issue highlights that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}) while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {model_label: 0}). The expected behavior is that both cases should return the same consistent result. \n\nFrom the search results, I have identified the django/db/models/query.py file as the primary source for the QuerySet.delete method. This method initializes and calls the delete method from the Collector class located in django/db/models/deletion.py. The Collector.delete method is responsible for collecting and deleting the objects, returning the count of deleted objects and a detailed dictionary of model deletions. This method directly affects the result format reported in the issue.\n\nI have also examined the django/db/models/base.py file, which contains the Model.delete method. This method is a direct method on model instances and can be related to how individual instances are handled in deletion operations. However, it is the QuerySet.delete method that is primarily responsible for the bulk deletion behavior and thus the focus should mainly be on the QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete methods.\n\nGiven the issue and the code context, the relevant code spans are in the QuerySet and Collector classes. Specifically, the QuerySet.delete and Collector.delete methods contain logic that directly contributes to the result inconsistencies mentioned in the issue.",
