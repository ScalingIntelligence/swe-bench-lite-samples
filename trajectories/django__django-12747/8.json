Specifically, when zero objects are deleted, the result varies depending on whether the model has foreign keys or not. To address this, it's important to locate the implementation of the delete method in the QuerySet class, as well as any related methods or classes that might handle the deletion process, including the Collector class and DeleteQuery class. Searching these specific classes and methods will help identify where the inconsistency arises and how to consistently format the result when zero objects are deleted.",

The issue highlights that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {<model_label>: 0}). To address this, the relevant code spans must be identified where the delete method of the QuerySet class and the Collector class handle the deletion process and the return values.Upon reviewing the search results, the code spans related to the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the Collector.delete method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' are identified as relevant. These spans handle the logic for deleting objects and constructing the result tuple.

The Collector.delete method is responsible for performing the actual deletion and consolidating the results. The current implementation in Collector.delete shows the logic for counting deleted objects and formatting the result dictionary. It appears that the Collector class handles the counting of deleted objects and the subsequent formatting of the result, including the case when zero objects are deleted. Given the provided file context, it seems possible to identify and address the inconsistency described in the issue by carefully examining the logic in the Collector.delete method.
