Specifically, the 'Collector' class contains the 'can_fast_delete' and 'delete' methods, which are directly related to how objects are deleted and the results are formatted. Additionally, the 'QuerySet' class includes the 'delete' method, which is the primary interface for deleting objects and interacting with the 'Collector'. The context provided is comprehensive enough to understand and potentially address the inconsistency in the delete result format when zero objects are deleted. Further analysis of the 'can_fast_delete' method and the delete process in both the 'Collector' and 'QuerySet' classes should suffice to determine if the inconsistency can be resolved by adjusting the logic or handling within these methods.",
