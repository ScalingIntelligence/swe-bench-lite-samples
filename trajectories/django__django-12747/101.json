The issue identifies two scenarios: one where there are models with foreign keys and another where there are 'simple' models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is that both scenarios should return consistent results, either both with an empty dictionary or both with a dictionary containing model-label keys and a zero value. Through analysis of the search results, I identified the relevant code spans that handle the deletion process: 1. The delete() method within the QuerySet class is responsible for initiating the deletion process and calling the Collector class. 2. The Collector class initializes the deletion process, collects the objects to be deleted, and handles the actual deletion in its delete() method. 3. The DeleteQuery class in django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py handles the SQL-level deletion of objects in batches, which is crucial for understanding how zero objects might be handled. 4. The SQLDeleteCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py is responsible for compiling the SQL for the deletion queries, which is significant for understanding how the SQL queries are constructed and executed. These code spans are relevant to the issue as they cover the flow from initiating the deletion to actually executing the SQL queries, which might reveal where the inconsistency arises.",
