Upon reviewing the provided search results, two key sections of code are identified: 'QuerySet.delete' in django/db/models/query.py and 'Model.delete' in django/db/models/base.py. The former is crucial as it directly relates to the QuerySet method that returns the tuple (X, Y) where X is the total amount of deleted objects and Y is the dictionary. The latter 'Model.delete' method might also be relevant as it could influence the behavior of the deletions in the QuerySet method. Both methods utilize the 'Collector' class to handle the deletion process, which could introduce variations in behavior when no objects are deleted. Thus, these code spans are directly relevant to diagnosing and resolving the reported issue.",

There are different behaviors for models with and without foreign keys: for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is for both cases to either return the empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nTo address this issue, I analyzed the existing code in the <file_context> and <search_results> tags. The relevant parts of the code are in the 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py' files. Specifically, I reviewed the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the Collector.delete method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. These methods handle the deletion of objects and the collection of related objects to be deleted, respectively.\n\nWithin the QuerySet.delete method, I identified the section that returns the deleted objects count and a dictionary with counters of deleted objects for each model. This section is critical for understanding the current behavior.\n\nIn the Collector.delete method, I focused on the part that constructs the deleted_counter dictionary which is later returned as part of the result. This dictionary should be consistent regardless of whether objects are deleted or not.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans of code are relevant to the issue, as they are directly involved in the generation of the result tuple that shows inconsistency when zero objects are deleted. The spans include the QuerySet.delete method responsible for the logic of deleting objects and returning the results, and the Collector.delete method which handles the collection and deletion of related objects.",

The current implementation suggests that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign key, the result is (0, {'model.label': 0}). The expectation is for both cases to have either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the Collector.collect() and Collector.delete() methods within the django/db/models/deletion.py file. These methods are responsible for collecting objects for deletion and executing the delete operation, respectively. The existing logic needs to be analyzed to determine how it deals with cases where no objects are to be deleted. Understanding this logic will be crucial to address the reported issue consistently. The analysis should include how dictionaries are created and populated during the deletion process, as well as how they are handled when no deletions occur.\n\nGiven the provided context and search results, the identified code spans are directly involved in the deletion process and are likely the starting points for any necessary adjustments to achieve consistent behavior in the deletion result format. It is recommended to verify that these methods correctly handle and report the deletion counts (especially when none are deleted) for all relevant models, whether they have foreign keys or not.",
