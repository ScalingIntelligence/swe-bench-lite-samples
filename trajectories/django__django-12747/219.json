The inconsistency arises when zero objects are deleted; for models with foreign keys, Y is an empty dictionary {}, but for simple models without foreign keys, Y includes model-label keys with zero values. To address this, we should identify the specific part of the code responsible for generating this result and ensure consistency in all cases.",

The logic in `Collector.delete` includes handling of fast deletes and batch deletions, which is pertinent to the issue. The issue's request for consistency in the result format, particularly when zero objects are deleted, can be addressed by examining the logic in `Collector.delete` to ensure that the dictionary Y always includes model-label keys with zero values when no objects are deleted, regardless of whether the model has foreign keys or not.
