The problem is specifically about the format of the result tuple (X, Y) where X is the total number of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary of counters for each model. The inconsistency occurs when X is 0; sometimes Y is an empty dictionary and sometimes it includes model labels with a count of 0. To address this, we need to investigate the delete method in the QuerySet class and possibly related functions in the deletion module to ensure consistent handling of the result tuple when no objects are deleted.",

The search results provided include relevant code spans from both 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py' files. Specifically, the QuerySet.delete method in 'django/db/models/query.py' is responsible for managing the deletion process and returning the result tuple. Additionally, the 'Collector' class in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is crucial as it handles the actual deletion of objects and the calculation of the result tuple. Both these sections of code need to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure consistency in the result tuple when no objects are deleted. The identified spans include the QuerySet class and its delete method, as well as the Collector class with methods like collect, delete, and related_objects, which are pivotal to understanding and resolving the reported issue.
