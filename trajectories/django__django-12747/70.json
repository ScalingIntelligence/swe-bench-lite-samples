Specifically, it mentions that for models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign key, the result is a tuple (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expectation is that both cases should either return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\nFrom the search results, I identified two key files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. These files contain the implementation of the QuerySet.delete method and the Collector class, respectively. The QuerySet.delete method is where the actual deletion logic is encapsulated, and it interacts with the Collector class to handle the deletion of related objects and determine the result format.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/query.py', the QuerySet.delete method calls the Collector.collect method to collect objects for deletion and then calls the Collector.delete method to perform the deletion. This method returns the number of deleted objects and a dictionary with deletion counters for each model.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the Collector class's delete method is responsible for handling the deletion process, including sending pre_delete and post_delete signals, updating fields, and actually deleting objects. The delete method returns a counter of deleted objects for each model, which is used to form the result tuple in the QuerySet.delete method.\n\nThe inconsistency in the result format when zero objects are deleted likely arises from the handling of these cases in the Collector.delete method. By examining the relevant code spans in these files, I can pinpoint the exact logic that determines the result format and identify any discrepancies that need to be addressed.\n\nThe identified code spans for further analysis include:\n1. 'django/db/models/query.py' - QuerySet.delete method.\n2. 'django/db/models/deletion.py' - Collector.delete method.",
