The issue is that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is consistency in the result format between these two cases.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to focus on the implementation of the delete method in the QuerySet class and the Collector class, as these are responsible for the collection and deletion of objects, respectively. The relevant code spans are located in 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/query.py', the QuerySet.delete method is defined, which initializes a Collector object and collects the objects to be deleted before calling the Collector.delete method. This method is primarily responsible for the deletion logic and returning the deletion results.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the Collector class contains the logic for collecting and deleting objects. The delete method of the Collector class iterates through collected objects and deletes them, then returns the count of deleted objects and a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each model. This is where the inconsistency arises, as the dictionary can be empty for models with foreign keys or contain model-label keys with zero values for 'simple' models.\n\nTo resolve the inconsistency, we need to ensure that the dictionary always contains model-label keys and zero values when no objects are deleted, regardless of whether the models have foreign keys. This involves modifying the Collector.delete method to include these keys in the dictionary when no objects are deleted.",
