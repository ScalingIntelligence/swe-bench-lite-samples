Specifically, the result should be consistent regardless of whether the model has foreign keys. To resolve this, I need to investigate the implementation of the delete method in the QuerySet class and the Collector class, which are involved in the deletion process. The goal is to identify where this inconsistency arises and consider possible solutions for ensuring the result is consistently either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.delete method when zero objects are deleted. The issue describes that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). The expected behavior is for the result to be consistent across both cases, either both having an empty dictionary or both having a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. To address this issue, we need to look into the code responsible for handling the delete operation and the result formatting. From the provided search results, several key spans seem relevant:\n\n1. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method constructs the result tuple (X, Y) where X is the total count of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary with model labels and their respective counts. This method seems to be where the inconsistency might arise.\n\n2. In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet.delete` method uses the Collector to perform the delete operation and returns the result. This method integrates the deletion logic for QuerySets and is likely where the return value is determined.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans are primarily in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file under the `Collector.delete` method and the `django/db/models/query.py` file under the `QuerySet.delete` method. These spans should be examined further to determine the exact point where the inconsistency occurs and to implement a fix to ensure consistent result formatting for zero deleted objects.",

Specifically, the issue notes that for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), while for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}). This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure consistent results across all models.\n\nFrom the current file context, we have examined the code spans in the 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file, particularly focusing on the 'Collector.delete' method. This method handles the deletion of objects and the generation of the result tuple (X, Y), where X is the total number of deleted objects and Y is a dictionary with counts of deleted objects per model.\n\nIn the 'django/db/models/query.py' file, we looked at the 'QuerySet.delete' method. This method sets up the deletion process and uses the 'Collector' class to perform the actual deletions. The result from the 'Collector.delete' method is returned as the result of the 'QuerySet.delete' method.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies described in the issue, it is crucial to determine if the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file contains relevant code spans that might address the discrepancy between models with and without foreign keys. This file contains definitions for related fields such as 'ForeignKey' and 'OneToOneField', which are likely involved in the deletion process when foreign keys are present.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided spans in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', particularly the 'ForeignKey' and 'OneToOneField' class definitions, it appears that these classes are indeed relevant to the issue since they deal with foreign key relationships and one-to-one relationships. The '__init__' method of 'ForeignKey' ensures that the 'on_delete' parameter is callable, which is crucial for handling behavior upon deletion, potentially impacting the result format of 'QuerySet.delete'.\n\nTherefore, identifying the relevant code spans in this file could lead to the resolution of the reported issue by either aligning the result formats or providing a clear path to implement the desired consistency.",
