The analysis of the provided search results reveals the methods related to deletion: 'Collector.delete' in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'QuerySet.delete' in 'django/db/models/query.py'. Both methods are crucial as 'QuerySet.delete' calls 'Collector.delete' to perform the actual deletion. The 'Collector.delete' method processes the deletion and constructs the result tuple, which is returned and further processed by 'QuerySet.delete'. Given the specific problem of inconsistency when no objects are deleted, the relevant sections include the initial settings and processing within 'Collector.__init__', the deletion logic in 'Collector.delete', and the interaction with 'Collector' in 'QuerySet.delete'. These sections need a detailed review to identify where the inconsistency arises and how it can be resolved. Therefore, the identified spans directly touch upon the areas where the inconsistency might be originating and need to be addressed.",
