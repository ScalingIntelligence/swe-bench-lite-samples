            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inconsistency in the result format of the QuerySet.delete method when zero objects are deleted. The issue specifically concerns the tuple returned by this method, which contains the total number of deleted objects and a dictionary of deleted objects per model. The inconsistency arises when the number of deleted objects is zero: for models with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for 'simple' models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'model_label': 0}). To address this issue, it's necessary to analyze the code responsible for the delete operation. My analysis starts with the 'QuerySet.delete' method in 'django/db/models/query.py', which orchestrates the delete operation using a 'Collector' object. The 'Collector' class, located in 'django/db/models/deletion.py', is responsible for collecting and managing the objects to be deleted and then performing the actual deletion. The 'delete' method in the 'Collector' class is particularly relevant as it controls the deletion process and ultimately returns the count of deleted objects and their distribution across models. The 'Collector.delete' method uses a 'Counter' to keep track of deleted objects per model, which should be adjusted to ensure consistency regardless of whether foreign keys are involved. Additionally, the 'DeleteQuery.delete_batch' method in 'django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py' is identified as part of the deletion process, but it primarily focuses on executing the SQL delete queries in batches and might not be directly related to the inconsistency issue. Based on my analysis, the primary focus should be on the 'Collector.delete' method to ensure a consistent result format when zero objects are deleted.",
