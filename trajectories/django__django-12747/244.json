Review Current Context:\n   - No relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n   - In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector` class and its `delete` method handle deletion operations, including counting deleted objects for each model.\n   - In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet` class and its `delete` method call the `Collector` to handle the deletion.\n   - In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class and its `delete` method also use the `Collector`.\n   - The `delete` methods in `DatabaseCache` and `DeletionMixin` are not directly relevant to the reported issue.\n\n   Relevant code spans:\n   - `django/db/models/deletion.py::Collector::delete`: This method is crucial as it implements the deletion logic and returns the result format.\n   - `django/db/models/query.py::QuerySet::delete`: This method defines how deletion is performed on a `QuerySet`.\n   - `django/db/models/base.py::Model::delete`: This method handles deletion at the model instance level.\n\nGiven the analysis, the relevant code spans are in the `Collector`, `QuerySet`, and `Model` classes, which are directly related to the deletion operations and the reported issue.\n\n",
