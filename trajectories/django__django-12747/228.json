We should ensure that the result format is consistent across all cases, specifically when no objects are deleted. The provided code indicates that the delete method in QuerySet calls the Collector's delete method, which loops through models and instances to perform deletions and computes the deleted counter. We need to refine this logic to ensure that the result format is always a tuple with a dictionary containing model labels and their respective deletion counts, even when no objects are deleted. This involves checking and possibly modifying the part of the code where the deletion counter is updated and returned, ensuring that an empty dictionary or dictionary with zero values for all models is consistently returned for no deletions.",
