The 'delete' method in the QuerySet class, the 'delete' method in the Model class, and the 'delete_batch' method in the DeleteQuery class are the key points of interest. Also, the Collector class and its 'delete' method should be examined to understand the deletion process.",

Specifically, for models with foreign keys, the result tuple is (0, {}), while for simple models without foreign keys, the result is (0, {'model_label': 0}). This inconsistency needs to be addressed by ensuring that the result format is consistent between these two cases. The provided search results include relevant code spans from the Django codebase that are likely involved in the delete operation. These spans include the delete method in the QuerySet class, which interacts with the Collector class to perform the deletion and collect the results. Additionally, there are spans related to the Collector class methods such as collect and delete, which handle the actual deletion process and result formatting. Finally, there are spans in the DeleteQuery class that handle SQL deletion operations, which are also relevant to understanding the deletion process. By analyzing these code spans, I can identify the parts of the code that are directly involved in the deletion process and the formatting of the deletion results, which will be essential for addressing the reported issue.",
