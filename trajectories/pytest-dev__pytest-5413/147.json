Specifically, when using `pytest.raises`, the `str(e)` output differs from the standard `try-except` block, requiring the use of `str(e.value)` to get the full message. The focus should be on the implementation and behavior of `pytest.raises` and its associated context management. This can be investigated by looking into the `python_api.py` file where the `raises` function is defined and checking the `RaisesContext` class within it. Additionally, the `nodes.py` file can be reviewed for the `Node` class, especially concerning the `_repr_failure_py` method, as it might handle how exceptions are represented. Further, the `_code/code.py` file should be inspected for the `ExceptionInfo` and `FormattedExcinfo` classes, as they are involved in exception handling and representation.",

The user is inquiring if this behavior could be changed to eliminate this discrepancy.\n\nThe current context provided involves code from `src/_pytest/nodes.py` and `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`, which focuses on handling exceptions and tracebacks. These files contain definitions for `Node`, `FSCollector`, `_repr_failure_py`, and other related functionalities that deal with error handling and representation.\n\nThe new search results from `src/_pytest/python_api.py` provide more context on how `pytest.raises` is implemented. Notably, there's a definition for `raises`, which includes the `RaisesContext` class. This class is crucial as it manages the context of exceptions raised within tests.\n\nKey points to note from the search results:\n1. The `raises` function is designed to accept an expected exception and a callable or code string to execute within a controlled environment.\n2. The `RaisesContext` class is initialized with `expected_exception`, `message`, and `match_expr`, and it stores the exception information in `self.excinfo`.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on `str()` handling within `pytest.raises`, the identified code spans in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` are directly relevant. They offer insights into how `pytest.raises` is implemented and how exceptions are managed within the context of a test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans seem to directly address the reported issue.
