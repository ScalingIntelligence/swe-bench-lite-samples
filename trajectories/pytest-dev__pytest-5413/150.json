The user observed that using `str(e)` inside a `pytest.raises` context prints a different output compared to using `str(e)` in a normal `try-except` block. The key point here is understanding how `pytest.raises` handles exceptions and how the context object (`e` in this case) is structured. The search results yield several test cases that use `pytest.raises` context manager and evaluate different aspects of its functionality. These tests check for various exception types, matching patterns, and the behavior when no exception is raised. Some tests also specifically focus on the `str()` representation of the exception info object. These tests and their code spans are relevant to the user's issue as they touch on how exceptions are handled within the `pytest.raises` context and can provide insights into the internal mechanics affecting the `str()` behavior.",
