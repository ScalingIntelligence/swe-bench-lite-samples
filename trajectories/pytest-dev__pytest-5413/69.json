Specifically, it points out that while using try/except, `str(e)` outputs the full exception message, but with pytest.raises, `str(e)` only provides a partial message, necessitating the use of `str(e.value)` to obtain the full message.\n\nGiven this, the relevant search results to investigate are those related to the implementation of `pytest.raises` and the `RaisesContext` class, which is responsible for handling and managing the exceptions caught by pytest.raises.\n\nFrom the search results provided, the following are identified as relevant:\n- The import statements and environment setups are not relevant to the issue directly, so they can be disregarded.\n- The 'raises' span contains the definition of the `raises` function, which is central to handling exceptions in pytest. This function instantiates the `RaisesContext` class (which is relevant as it manages exception context), and also handles how exceptions are caught and managed. Its relevance to the issue is high, as it controls the main behavior of `pytest.raises`.\n- The 'RaisesContext' span and specifically its `__init__` method are directly involved in setting up the context for caught exceptions. Understanding how instances of `RaisesContext` are initialized and how they store information about caught exceptions is essential for resolving the issue.\n\nThese sections of code are crucial for understanding and possibly modifying the behavior of `pytest.raises` to match the expected handling of exceptions as seen in standard try/except blocks.\n\nConsequently, the 'raises' and 'RaisesContext.__init__' spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
