The unexpected DESCENDING sort order and the unnecessary JOINS are the main concerns. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the methods and classes involved in query compilation, query building, and field relationships. The provided files hint at potential locations for these functionalities, including `SQLCompiler`, `Query`, `ForeignKey`, and `OrderBy`. Given the detailed description of the problem, it is advisable to look into these specific methods and classes deeply to understand how self-referencing foreign keys are being handled during query construction.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves unexpected ordering behavior with a self-referencing foreign key in Django models. The user's models include a `OneModel` with a self-referencing foreign key (`root`) and a `TwoModel` with a foreign key to `OneModel`. The user observes incorrect SQL queries when ordering by `record__root_id` and suggests that the issue might be related to the self-referencing nature of the foreign key.\n\nIn the provided search results, the following code spans seem relevant:\n\n1. `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` - This file contains the `SQLCompiler` class, which is responsible for compiling Django QuerySets into SQL. Relevant spans include `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` and `SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name`, which handle the conversion of QuerySet ordering into SQL ORDER BY clauses.\n\n2. `django/db/models/expressions.py` - This file defines the `OrderBy` class, which represents ordering in QuerySets. Methods such as `OrderBy.__init__`, `OrderBy.as_sql`, and `OrderBy.reverse_ordering` are relevant as they deal with how ordering expressions are constructed and compiled into SQL.\n\n3. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - The `Query` class is defined here, which builds and manipulates the SQL query representation. `Query.names_to_path` and `Query.setup_joins` methods are relevant for understanding how field paths are resolved and joins are set up in the query.\n\n4. `django/db/models/fields/related.py` - The `ForeignKey` class is defined here, which is relevant as it is the field type in question (self-referencing foreign key). The `ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields` method is particularly relevant as it deals with the resolution of related fields, which could be a source of the unexpected behavior.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, these code spans should provide a good starting point for further investigation into why the self-referencing foreign key is causing unexpected ordering in the SQL queries.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
