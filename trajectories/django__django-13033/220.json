The problem seems to stem from how Django handles the self-referencing foreign key and the ordering logic. To debug this issue, we should focus on the parts of the Django ORM code that handle the generation of SQL queries, especially those related to ordering and joining tables. Specifically, the `order_by` method, SQL query compilation, and the handling of self-referencing foreign keys in the ORM are areas that need to be examined.",

The user provided several models and querysets demonstrating the issue, specifically noting an unexpected DESCENDING sort and unnecessary joins in the SQL query when ordering by 'record__root_id' or 'record__root'. The provided search results include relevant Django core files such as 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', and 'django/db/models/expressions.py' which contain classes and methods related to SQL compilation, field relationships, and expressions like 'OrderBy'. These files appear to be directly related to the functionality needed to address the reported issue. Specifically, the 'get_order_by' method in 'SQLCompiler' class in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' seems to determine how ordering is handled, which is central to the issue. Similarly, the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and the 'OrderBy' class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' are also crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue related to self-referencing foreign keys and ordering.",

The problem seems to stem from how Django handles the self-referencing foreign key and the ordering logic. To debug this issue, we should focus on the parts of the Django ORM code that handle the generation of SQL queries, especially those related to ordering and joining tables. Specifically, the `order_by` method, SQL query compilation, and the handling of self-referencing foreign keys in the ORM are areas that need to be examined. The provided file context includes relevant code from `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, and `django/db/models/expressions.py`, which are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue. These files cover the SQL query compilation process, the handling of related fields including self-referencing foreign keys, and the expression classes used for ordering. The methods `get_order_by` in `SQLCompiler` and the constructors of `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` are particularly relevant. Therefore, the provided file context appears to be comprehensive for addressing the reported issue.",

Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
