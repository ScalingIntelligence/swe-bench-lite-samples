The problem manifests when attempting to order by a relation '_id' field, leading to unexpected SQL queries with superfluous joins and incorrect ordering. The models involved are OneModel and TwoModel, both containing foreign keys that reference OneModel. Several strategies to workaround the issue have been mentioned, involving changing the order by parameters and using annotations. Based on the issue description and provided file context, it's clear that the problem resides within the Django ORM logic that handles foreign key relationships and sorting. I will focus the search on specific modules and functions within Django's db/models directory that deal with query compilation, sorting, and join handling to identify the root cause.",

These involve SQL query compilation, ordering, and joining logic which are directly related to the reported issue.\n\nThe `Query` class and its methods (`as_sql`, `build_filter`, `setup_joins`) deal with constructing and managing SQL queries, which is crucial for understanding how the queryset operations translate to SQL. The `SQLCompiler` class and its `get_order_by` method are responsible for determining the ordering of SQL queries, which is directly relevant to the issue of unexpected sorting behavior.\n\nThe `OrderBy` class and its `as_sql` method handle the compilation of ordering expressions into SQL, which is essential for addressing the sorting issues in the reported issue. The `Aggregate` class and its `as_sql` method relate to annotation and aggregation in queries, potentially useful for understanding and implementing the workaround.\n\nThe `RelatedIn` and `Join` classes are also relevant as they handle related-in lookups and join operations, which are crucial components of the SQL queries that are problematic in the reported issue.\n\nGiven the complexity and deep integration of the issue across several Django modules, these identified code spans provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the reported issue, but more context and potentially additional code spans might be needed for a comprehensive resolution.",

The issue reported centers around incorrect ordering behaviors related to self-referencing foreign keys, leading to unnecessary joins and incorrect sorting directions. The provided code spans critical components such as the Query class in 'query.py', which manages query construction and joins, and the SQLCompiler class in 'compiler.py', responsible for SQL generation. The OrderBy class in 'expressions.py' is also highlighted, showcasing how order by clauses are handled. The code efficiently deals with various SQL constructs like DISTINCT, ORDER BY, and JOIN clauses, among others. Given the detailed context provided, it's evident that the file context is highly relevant and directly addresses the problem scenarios described in the issue, including ordering by related '_id' fields and handling of redundant joins. Therefore, the provided context is thorough and relevant to diagnosing and potentially addressing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
