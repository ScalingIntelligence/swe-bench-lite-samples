The problem seems to stem from the handling of self-referencing foreign keys and the `order_by` method in Django's ORM. The provided models and querysets indicate that the default ordering from the model's meta settings might be interfering with the explicit ordering in the queryset. To resolve this, we need to identify the relevant parts of Django's ORM that handle these aspects, particularly focusing on the `order_by` method and the logic that determines the SQL joins.",

Three main files with relevant code spans have been identified: 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', 'django/db/models/query.py', and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py'. These files contain the core logic for how Django handles SQL compilation and query ordering.\n\nAnalysis of the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file reveals key methods such as 'get_order_by' and 'find_ordering_name', which directly handle the generation and processing of ORDER BY clauses in SQL queries. These methods manage how Django incorporates sorting directives into its SQL statements, which is directly related to the reported issue of incorrect ordering with self-referencing foreign keys.\n\nThe 'django/db/models/query.py' file includes the 'QuerySet.order_by' method, which is crucial as it is the primary interface for specifying ordering in Django querysets. This method adjusts the query object to include the desired ordering, and discrepancies here could lead to unexpected results such as those noted in the issue.\n\nFinally, the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file contains foundational classes and methods for building SQL queries, including 'setup_joins' which is used to establish joins between tables as specified in the queryset. Improper handling of these joins can lead to unnecessary joins or incorrect SQL generation, which matches the observed behavior in the issue where extra joins occurred due to the self-referencing foreign key.\n\nGiven the complexity and interconnectedness of these code spans, they are all considered relevant to the reported issue. They cover the necessary functionality from setting up joins, processing ordering directives, to actually compiling those into SQL queries. This comprehensive view is crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue of incorrect ordering by self-referencing foreign keys.",

The error involves unnecessary joins and incorrect ordering, which suggests a deeper issue in how Django's ORM interprets and translates these relationships into SQL. It may require a more comprehensive review of how joins and ordering are managed across multiple components like `Query` and `SQLCompiler`.

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
