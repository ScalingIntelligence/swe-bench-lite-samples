When ordering by a related field like 'record__root_id', the query produces unexpected results due to an extra join and incorrect sorting order. This might be due to how Django handles self-referencing foreign keys in queries and the ordering mechanism. The search should focus on the `django/db/models/sql` directory where query compilation happens, especially on methods like `setup_joins` and `find_ordering_name` which might be involved in the decision to add an extra join or the incorrect ordering. Additionally, understanding how ordering instructions conflict or coexist with class-level ordering might clarify the issue.",

After carefully analyzing the provided search results from django/db/models/sql/compiler.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py, it is apparent that both files contain core functionality related to SQL query compilation and query setup, which are likely essential for addressing the issue at hand. Specifically, the SQLCompiler class in compiler.py and the Query class in query.py offer a variety of methods that may be involved in constructing and managing SQL queries, including handling of joins and ordering. Given the complexity of the issue, these classes and their methods (like find_ordering_name in SQLCompiler and setup_joins in Query) could be pivotal in understanding and potentially resolving the problem of incorrect ordering with a self-referencing foreign key. Therefore, both files and their respective code spans seem highly relevant in the context of diagnosing and addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
