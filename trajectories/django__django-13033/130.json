The problem seems to be rooted in how Django handles the ordering and joining logic when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. To investigate this, we should focus on the methods and classes involved in generating SQL queries, processing ordering, and handling joins in Django's ORM. Specifically, we should look into the SQLCompiler, Query, and OrderBy classes, along with their respective methods like get_order_by, find_ordering_name, setup_joins, and as_sql. Additionally, the ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes in the related fields module should be examined for any issues in how they handle self-referencing keys.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to a Django ORM problem where ordering by a self-referencing foreign key results in unexpected SQL queries, particularly with unnecessary joins and incorrect sorting orders. The models involved are OneModel and TwoModel, both of which have a foreign key relationship with each other. The queryset in question is attempting to order by a related 'root_id' field, but the SQL generated includes an unnecessary LEFT OUTER JOIN and an incorrect DESCENDING sort order.\n\nThe primary focus in the search results should be on the sections of code that handle the SQL query compilation and the processing of ordering clauses. Specifically, we need to look at how the Django ORM constructs the 'ORDER BY' clauses and handles self-referencing foreign keys. The SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py is of particular interest, as it contains methods that dictate how the 'ORDER BY' clause is generated and how joins are set up.\n\nKey methods to examine in SQLCompiler include 'get_order_by', 'find_ordering_name', and 'setup_joins'. These methods determine the fields used in ordering and the joins necessary to access those fields. Additionally, the ForeignKey class in django/db/models/fields/related.py is relevant because it handles the self-referencing foreign key relationship in the models. Specifically, the 'resolve_related_fields' method in ForeignKey could potentially contain logic that leads to unnecessary joins or incorrect field references.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided code spans, several are identified as relevant:\n\n1. SQLCompiler.get_order_by: This method constructs the 'ORDER BY' clause, which is directly related to the sorting issue in the queryset.\n2. SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name: This method is used to find the correct ordering field and manages the potential for infinite loops caused by recursive relationships.\n3. SQLCompiler.setup_joins: This method sets up the joins in the query and is crucial for understanding why unnecessary joins might be occurring.\n4. ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields: This method resolves the fields involved in the foreign key relationship and is critical for understanding the relationship between OneModel and TwoModel.\n\nThese code spans are identified as relevant because they directly influence how the ORM constructs SQL queries involving ordering and foreign keys, which are central to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
