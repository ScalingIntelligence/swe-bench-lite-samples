The issue seems to stem from how Django handles the ordering when there are self-referencing foreign keys. The models provided in the issue include OneModel and TwoModel, where OneModel has a self-referencing foreign key named 'root'. When attempting to order by 'record__root_id' in a queryset involving TwoModel, the SQL generated includes an unexpected DESCENDING sort and unnecessary JOINs. The search results provided contain code related to OrderBy class in Django, which handles the sorting in querysets. The __init__ method of OrderBy class initializes the ordering parameters such as descending, nulls_first, and nulls_last. The asc and desc methods control the direction of the ordering. These methods could be relevant to understanding how the ordering is applied in the queryset and why the unexpected results occur. Given the detailed description of the issue, it is clear that the problem lies in how Django interprets and translates the order_by in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys. The provided search results do not directly address the self-referencing foreign key issue but provide context on how Django's OrderBy class works, which is crucial for understanding the root cause of the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the handling of self-referencing foreign keys in Django's ORM, specifically when ordering by a related '_id' field. The issue seems to be centered around the SQL query generation and how ordering is applied, particularly when the default ordering is applied to models with self-referencing foreign keys.\n\nFrom the issue, it's clear that the problematic behavior arises when sorting by 'root_id' due to an unnecessary extra join and incorrect sort order. The analysis of the useful search results focuses on the SQLCompiler and Query classes, as these are crucial for generating SQL queries and handling ordering.\n\nThe SQLCompiler class is responsible for translating the Query objects into SQL statements. The get_order_by method in this class processes the ordering of query results. This method handles different ordering scenarios based on the provided query, including dealing with meta ordering, extra order_by clauses, and standard vs. non-standard ordering rules.\n\nThe find_ordering_name method in SQLCompiler helps resolve ordering based on field names and can also handle complex ordering patterns. It allows Django to understand and extend ordering based on lookup paths.\n\nThe setup_joins method in the Query class is essential for setting up the join operations needed to navigate through related objects. This method is crucial for query formation, especially when dealing with nested relations, which is precisely the case when a model references itself.\n\nThe build_filter method in the Query class is relevant as well, as it constructs the filtering part of the SQL query from the Django query expressions. This is useful for understanding how Django translates complex query expressions into SQL conditions.\n\nSo, while analyzing the provided code, it is observed that searching for relevant code spans particularly focused on SQL query compilation (where order_by and join mechanics are handled) and filter construction is necessary. However, based on descriptions in the query results section, complete parts of relevant codes are missing (\"... rest of the content...\" tag within code sections might suggest an incomplete grasp of all aspects related to order_by and self-referencing field mechanisms). Therefore, assertions on additional search actions relative the search results might result in additional parts of the relevant codes or clarifications around code-behavior relationships might be sensitive in emergent AI output generation models like the described. Subsequently, the search relevance of executed actions might be found in need for further search operations for reaching the full understanding or identifying missing parts, considering more chunks upfront with AI labeled search results identification.",

The issue was found in versions 2.2.10 and 3.0.6. The main concern is that the order_by() function does not take precedence over the default sort order, leading to unexpected results and unnecessary JOINs in the SQL query.\n\nFrom the analysis of the search results, the relevant code spans are primarily found in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files. These files contain methods related to query compilation, ordering, and join setup, which are essential for understanding and resolving the issue.\n\nThe `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is particularly relevant, as it deals with the ordering of queries and how they interact with default ordering settings. The `Query.setup_joins()` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is also important, as it handles the setup of joins, which is a key factor in the unnecessary joins reported in the issue.\n\nGiven these findings, the search task is complete, as the identified code spans provide a clear understanding of the relevant parts of the Django ORM codebase related to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
