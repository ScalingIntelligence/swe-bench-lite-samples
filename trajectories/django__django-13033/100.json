Specifically, the issue seems to revolve around the ordering of related fields causing unnecessary joins and unexpected ordering directions. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that might be related to this issue, particularly in the context of how Django handles ForeignKey fields, ordering, and SQL query compilation.\n\nThe code spans from `django/db/models/fields/related.py` include the `ForeignKey` class and its initialization method, which are crucial for understanding how foreign keys, including self-referencing ones, are defined and handled in Django models. This is directly related to the reported issue of unexpected behavior with self-referencing foreign keys.\n\nFrom `django/db/models/expressions.py`, the `OrderBy` class is relevant as it deals with how ordering is specified in Django queries. Inspecting how `OrderBy` instances are created and managed can provide insights into why the ordering might lead to unexpected SQL.\n\nThe `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is significant because it is responsible for compiling Django's Query objects into SQL. The method `get_order_by` specifically handles the conversion of ordering specifications into SQL, which is directly connected to the issue of unexpected ordering in SQL queries.\n\nLastly, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and its methods, like `build_filter` and `setup_joins`, are crucial as they are responsible for constructing the SQL query based on the Django ORM operations. Understanding how these methods handle foreign key relationships and joins can help explain why unnecessary joins are happening in SQL queries.\n\nThese code spans collectively provide a deep understanding of how Django constructs SQL queries involving foreign keys and ordering, which is directly relevant to the reported issue.",

The user has identified several querysets that give unexpected results, primarily due to the SQL query generated by Django. The key elements to focus on are the models' structure, the querysets, and the SQL queries they generate. The search results provided include relevant spans from Django's core SQL compiler and query classes. These spans cover the initialization and setup of queries, the handling of joins, and the processing of order by clauses. Particularly relevant are the spans dealing with the setup of joins and the handling of ordering in the SQLCompiler class. These parts of the code are crucial for understanding how Django constructs SQL queries, especially in the context of self-referencing foreign keys. The spans from the Query class also provide insight into the query setup and the handling of joins, which directly relate to the user's issue. The identified spans should be sufficient to diagnose and potentially fix the issue with the ordering by relation '_id' field in self-referencing foreign key scenarios.",

The user has observed that certain queries involving a self-referencing foreign key result in unexpected SQL queries, specifically with an unnecessary extra join and an incorrect default sort order. The provided code and context help to understand how Django handles foreign keys, joins, and order by clauses in its ORM.\n\nThe <file_context> provides snippets from three key files: `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, `django/db/models/expressions.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. These files contain the definitions and implementations of `ForeignKey`, `OrderBy`, and `SQLCompiler` classes, which are central to understanding how Django constructs queries involving foreign keys and order by clauses. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class contains methods that handle the generation of SQL query parts, including ordering.\n\nThe <search_results> section includes additional snippets from `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which further detail the SQL compilation process and the handling of ordering in queries. These snippets include methods related to setting up queries, handling joins, and managing order by clauses.\n\nGiven the issue's description and the code context, the relevant code spans appear to be those that deal with handling self-referencing foreign keys and the generation of SQL queries. The identified spans include those defining the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `OrderBy` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, and various methods in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` that are involved in constructing the order by part of SQL queries, such as `get_order_by` and `find_ordering_name`.\n\nThe analysis suggests that the issue might stem from the way Django constructs joins for self-referencing foreign keys and how it applies ordering based on these relationships. The identified code spans should be further examined to pinpoint potential areas that could be causing the unexpected behavior.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
