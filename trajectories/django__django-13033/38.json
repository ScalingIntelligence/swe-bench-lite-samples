The symptoms described include unexpected DESC sort orders, unnecessary JOINs, and the apparent influence of class-level ordering on queryset ordering. To pinpoint the root cause, we should focus on the logic that handles join creation and ordering in Django's ORM. Specifically, we should look into the SQLCompiler and Query classes, as they contain methods like `get_order_by`, `find_ordering_name`, and `setup_joins`, which are critical for constructing SQL queries. Additionally, the ForeignKey class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` could be relevant since it deals with the specifics of foreign key relationships.",

The issue is related to the handling of the ordering in the `SQLCompiler` and `Query` classes, as well as the `ForeignKey` field in Django's ORM. The provided search results contain several key methods and properties that are relevant to the issue: \n\n1. `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` - This method determines the ordering of the query results. It checks for explicit ordering, default ordering, and handles different types of ordering expressions. It is likely that the bug involves incorrect handling of self-referencing foreign key ordering here.\n\n2. `SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name` - This method finds the correct field to order by, considering possible joins. The issue might arise from incorrect detection or handling of self-referencing joins in this method.\n\n3. `Query.setup_joins` - This method sets up the necessary joins for the query. The unnecessary joins mentioned in the issue could be a result of incorrect join setup for self-referencing foreign keys.\n\n4. `ForeignKey.get_reverse_path_info` - This method is relevant to how Django handles reverse paths for foreign keys. Incorrect handling here could lead to unexpected behavior in queries involving self-referencing foreign keys.\n\n5. `ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields` - This method ensures that all related fields are correctly resolved. Any issues in resolving self-referencing fields might manifest here.\n\nBy analyzing these methods and properties, we can identify the code spans that are most relevant to the reported issue and determine if the search task is complete.",

Both of these files are crucial as they deal with the compilation and setup of SQL queries in Django. 3. Processed new search results, which included relevant code spans in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` related to query compilation and join setup, as well as in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` regarding field-related operations like `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField`. 4. Identified and extracted relevant code spans based on the reported issue, focusing on methods dealing with ordering and setting up joins in query construction. These steps helped discern the potential flaws in Django's handling of self-referencing foreign keys and ordering logic.

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
