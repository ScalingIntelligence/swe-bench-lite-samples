            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a self-referencing foreign key that doesn't correctly order by a related '_id' field, resulting in unexpected SQL queries with unnecessary joins and unexpected orderings. The problem seems to be rooted in the Django ORM's handling of self-referencing foreign keys and ordering. It is likely that the issue resides in the SQL query compilation or the query setup mechanisms within Django's ORM, particularly in the parts of the code responsible for join management and ordering. The provided context includes several Django core modules that interact with model querying and SQL compilation, such as `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. These are likely places to find the logic that is causing the behavior described in the issue. Therefore, searching in these areas with specific queries on 'self-referencing foreign key', 'ordering by relation', and 'unnecessary joins' should help in identifying the relevant code.",

The issue is particularly revealing in the SQL query generated, where an unnecessary JOIN and an unexpected DESCENDING sort order appear. The analysis of the provided search results points to several key areas that might be relevant to the issue:\n\n1. The `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` handles the ordering of the queryset and may be where the unexpected DESCENDING sort order originates.\n2. The `SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name` and `SQLCompiler._setup_joins` methods are also potentially involved in handling the joins and ordering, especially as they relate to self-referencing foreign keys.\n3. The `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is relevant as it handles the self-referencing foreign key in the model and might influence the behavior of the joins and ordering.\n4. The `Query.setup_joins` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is crucial for understanding how joins are set up, particularly in the context of self-referencing foreign keys.\n\nBased on the provided search results and the reported issue, these areas in the Django codebase seem most pertinent to the problem.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to an unexpected DESCENDING sort order in the SQL query generated by Django's ORM when ordering by a self-referencing foreign key. The issue seems to stem from the handling of order_by in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys and the default ordering applied at the model level. The provided search results cover the relevant parts of Django's ORM that handle ordering, joins, and the definition of foreign key relationships. Specifically, the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` and `SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name` methods in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` might be responsible for the unexpected behavior since they manage the translation of Django's order_by syntax into SQL ORDER BY clauses. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` define the behavior of foreign key relationships, including self-referencing ones, which might also contribute to the issue if there is special handling required for such cases that is not currently implemented. Similarly, the `Query.setup_joins` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is responsible for setting up the joins in the SQL query, which can become complex with self-referencing foreign keys and might introduce the unnecessary joins noted in the issue. Currently, the search results align with the identified problem areas, but specific methods and checks need to be tailored to ensure correct SQL generation for queries involving self-referencing foreign keys with specified ordering.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
