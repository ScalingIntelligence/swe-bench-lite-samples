The primary focus should be on the Django ORM internals responsible for query compilation, expression handling, and model field operations. Specifically, the suspected areas are how the ORM constructs queries involving self-referencing models, the method for determining ordering, and the handling of related fields such as ForeignKey.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a self-referencing foreign key in Django models that doesn't correctly order by a related '_id' field. The issue seems to be with the SQL query generated by Django's ORM when ordering by a self-referencing foreign key field, particularly the 'root_id' field in the 'OneModel' class. The expected behavior is for the 'order_by' clause to take precedence over the default ordering defined in the model's Meta class, but this doesn't seem to be happening, leading to unexpected descending sort orders.\n\nThe provided search results include relevant sections from Django's codebase, particularly focusing on the SQLCompiler class in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' and the Query class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py'. These sections handle the generation of SQL queries, managing order_by clauses, and setting up joins. The code spans 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' and 'Query.add_ordering' are particularly relevant as they deal with handling and applying ordering to the SQL query.\n\nGiven the issue description, it appears that the handling of ordering in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys might not be fully accounted for in the current logic, leading to the unexpected behavior observed. The analysis of these code spans suggests that while Django's ORM has mechanisms to handle ordering and joins, there might be a gap when these operations involve self-referencing models, especially when the ordering involves a foreign key to the same model.\n\nTo address the issue, it may be necessary to further investigate and possibly adjust the logic in the 'get_order_by' and 'add_ordering' methods to ensure that the 'order_by' clause is correctly applied without unnecessary joins or misinterpretation of the default ordering. Additionally, looking into the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' could provide insights into how self-referencing foreign keys are handled during query generation.",

This issue manifests in the SQL queries generated by Django's ORM for querysets involving such models. The issue is specific to the ordering mechanism in Django's ORM, particularly when ordering by fields that involve self-referencing foreign keys. The provided file context and search results contain code spans that are highly relevant to the issue. Specifically, the code spans related to 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by', 'Query.add_ordering', and 'ForeignKey.__init__' are crucial as they deal directly with the ordering logic and the initialization of foreign keys. These code spans will help in understanding how the ordering is handled and how foreign keys are managed in Django's ORM. The search results also include relevant code spans from 'QuerySet' which deals with the higher-level query operations, providing a broader context to the issue. By analyzing these code spans, we can gain insights into how the ordering by related fields works and identify potential areas for improvement or bug fixing.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
