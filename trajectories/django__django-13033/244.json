The problem is observed in the SQL query generation of the queryset. The relevant parts of the code appear to be in the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' files, focusing on methods that handle SQL query compilation and join operations. Specifically, issues might be related to how joins and ordering are handled when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. Also, 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' will be relevant for understanding the behavior of ForeignKey fields and their relationships.",

This issue involves Django's handling of self-referencing foreign keys and the SQL queries generated by Django's ORM. The problem seems to be that the default ordering of the model is affecting the query ordering in unexpected ways and causing unnecessary joins. To address this issue, we need to look at Django's ORM internals for managing joins, ordering, and querying related fields, particularly in the case of self-referencing foreign keys.\n\nGiven the search results, the most relevant files appear to be 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py'. These files contain code spans that deal with the core functionality of how Django handles queries, joins, and related field management. Specifically, the 'Query.join_parent_model' and 'Query.setup_joins' methods in 'query.py' are likely to be involved in how Django manages joins for self-referencing models. The 'ForeignKey' class in 'related.py' is also relevant, as it directly deals with foreign key relationships including self-referencing ones. Additionally, the 'SQLCompiler.get_related_selections' method in 'compiler.py' could be related to how Django constructs SQL queries involving related fields.\n\nThese methods and classes are likely to contain the logic that either causes the unnecessary joins or the descending order issue mentioned in the reported issue. By examining these specific parts of the Django ORM, we can gain a better understanding of how to identify and potentially fix the issue.",

The issue seems to stem from the internal handling of joins and ordering when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. The analysis of the provided code spans from Django's SQL query and model field implementations reveals crucial methods that likely handle the construction and optimization of SQL joins and ordering. Methods such as `setup_joins` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `get_related_selections` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` are particularly relevant as they involve setting up and managing joins in queries. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is notable for its role in defining foreign key relationships, including self-referencing ones. Given the complexity of the issue, a deeper inspection of these methods is warranted to understand how the ordering and join behavior might be altered or why it might not respect the specified ordering. This will help in either confirming a bug or identifying a misunderstanding in how the ordering is expected to work. The provided code spans are sufficient to start this deeper investigation.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue of ordering with self-referencing foreign keys in Django querysets is intricate and involves several key areas of Django's ORM internals. The provided file context already highlights some of the critical methods and their implementations, which are pivotal for understanding the behavior of querysets with self-referencing foreign keys. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the relevant methods and their potential impact on the issue at hand: \n\n1. **join_parent_model**: This method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is responsible for handling the joining of parent models, which is particularly relevant for self-referencing models. The method navigates through the chain of parent models, setting up joins and returning aliases. This method could potentially influence how joins are handled in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys.\n\n2. **setup_joins**: Also in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', this method sets up the joins required for the query based on the given field names and model options. It handles the joins and paths for fields, which is crucial for how querysets generate the final SQL. This method's role becomes particularly important when dealing with complex relationships involving self-referencing models.\n\n3. **get_related_selections**: Found in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', this method is responsible for adding related selections to the query based on the fields specified in the select_related parameter. As part of its functionality, it sets up joins, determines which fields to select, and handles the recursion for nested relationships. The method's handling of related selections could impact how the ordering of querysets involving self-referencing models is compiled into SQL.\n\nGiven these points, a deeper inspection of these methods\u2014specifically concerning how they handle and influence the ordering and joining behavior in the presence of self-referencing models\u2014is warranted. Additionally, reviewing the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' to understand its role and behavior when defining self-referencing relationships could provide further insights into the root cause of the issue.",

Notably, the 'Query.join_parent_model' and 'Query.setup_joins' methods are key to understanding how Django handles self-referencing models and joins. Additionally, the 'SQLCompiler.get_related_selections' method is crucial for how related fields are selected in query compilation.

            "scratch_pad": "The issue of ordering with self-referencing foreign keys in Django querysets is intricate and involves several key areas of Django's ORM internals. The provided file context already highlights some of the critical methods and their implementations, which are pivotal for understanding the behavior of querysets with self-referencing foreign keys. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the relevant methods and their potential impact on the issue at hand: 1. **join_parent_model**: This method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is responsible for handling the joining of parent models, which is particularly relevant for self-referencing models. The method navigates through the chain of parent models, setting up joins and returning aliases. This method could potentially influence how joins are handled in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys. 2. **setup_joins**: Also in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', this method sets up the joins required for the query based on the given field names and model options. It handles the joins and paths for fields, which is crucial for how querysets generate the final SQL. This method's role becomes particularly important when dealing with complex relationships involving self-referencing models. 3. **get_related_selections**: Found in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', this method is responsible for adding related selections to the query based on the fields specified in the select_related parameter. As part of its functionality, it sets up joins, determines which fields to select, and handles the recursion for nested relationships. The method's handling of related selections could impact how the ordering of querysets involving self-referencing models is compiled into SQL. Given these points, a deeper inspection of these methods\u2014specifically concerning how they handle and influence the ordering and joining behavior in the presence of self-referencing models\u2014is warranted. Additionally, reviewing the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' to understand its role and behavior when defining self-referencing relationships could provide further insights into the root cause of the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
