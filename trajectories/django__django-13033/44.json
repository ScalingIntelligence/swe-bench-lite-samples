To address this, we should focus our search on the methods and classes involved in query compilation, specifically those dealing with ordering and join handling.",

The user is experiencing unexpected results when ordering by a related '_id' field due to unnecessary joins and descending order issues. The issue is present in multiple versions of Django and involves specific queryset manipulations with models having self-referencing foreign keys.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several code spans seem relevant to the issue:\n\n1. `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n   - `Query.join_parent_model`: This method sets up joins between models, which could be related to the unnecessary joins observed in the issue.\n   - `Query.build_filter`: Responsible for constructing filter expressions, which might influence the SQL query structure.\n   - `Query.add_filter`, `Query.add_q`: These handle the addition of filters and Q objects, respectively, and may impact query composition.\n\n2. `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n   - `ForeignKey.to_python`, `ForeignKey.target_field`, `ForeignKey.get_reverse_path_info`, `ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields`: These deal with the specifics of foreign key fields, their targets, and resolving related fields, which is central to the issue described.\n\n3. `django/db/models/query.py`\n   - `QuerySet.resolve_expression`: Handles expressions within a queryset, which might be involved in the issue's context.\n\n4. `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`\n   - `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`: Responsible for ordering the results of a queryset, directly related to the ordering issue mentioned in the report.\n\nThese spans of code cover the components involved in forming and executing querysets, particularly in how they handle joins, filtering, and ordering, all of which are central to the reported issue. The spans are chosen based on their proximity to the problematic behavior described, such as incorrect ordering and unnecessary joins when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys.",

That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
