The issue is observed in queries where the ordering involves a self-referencing foreign key, leading to unexpected results or inefficient SQL joins. The search results provided include relevant parts of Django's ORM, particularly focusing on the `order_by` method in the `QuerySet` class and the `get_order_by` method in the `SQLCompiler` class. These methods handle the ordering of querysets and compilation of SQL ordering parts, respectively. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is also relevant as it pertains to the definition and behavior of foreign keys, which are central to the issue. These code spans could help understand the implementation of foreign keys and ordering operations in Django, potentially leading to insights on why the self-referencing foreign key issue arises.",

Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
