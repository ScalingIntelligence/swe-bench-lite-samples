The problem seems to be rooted in how Django handles ordering and joins when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. The main models involved are OneModel and TwoModel, with the key issue being the incorrect SQL query generated when ordering by 'record__root_id'. Given the provided context and the nature of the issue, focusing on the Django core files that deal with SQL query generation, compiler logic, and related field handling is crucial. Specifically, the files django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, django/db/models/sql/query.py, and django/db/models/fields/related.py are likely candidates for containing the root cause or related logic.",

This leads to unexpected SQL queries with unnecessary joins and incorrect sort orders. The issue can be replicated using two models: OneModel and TwoModel, where OneModel has a self-referencing foreign key. The user provided several queryset examples demonstrating the problem and potential workarounds.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the issues lie within the SQLCompiler and Query classes in Django's ORM. Specifically, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by function is responsible for generating the ORDER BY clause in SQL queries. It seems to incorrectly handle the self-referencing foreign key, leading to unintended joins and sort orders. The Query.setup_joins and Query.add_q functions also play a critical role in how joins and conditions are set up in the query, which could be contributing to the problem.\n\nGiven the provided code spans, the following are relevant:\n- SQLCompiler.get_order_by: This function determines the ordering of the query results and is likely where the incorrect sorting issue originates.\n- Query.setup_joins: This function sets up the joins for the query and seems to be involved in the unnecessary join issue when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys.\n- Query.add_q: This function adds query conditions, which could also be part of the issue if conditions involving self-referencing keys are not handled properly.\n- ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields: Although not directly mentioned in the user's issue, it's related to how foreign keys, especially self-referencing ones, are resolved and could potentially be related to the issue.",

The issue involves unexpected behavior in the SQL query generated by Django's ORM, including unnecessary JOINs and inappropriate sorting orders. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several key areas in Django's ORM that are relevant to this issue. The SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py contains the logic for generating the SQL 'ORDER BY' clause, which is crucial for understanding the sorting behavior mentioned in the issue. The Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py manages the overall query construction, including the handling of JOINs and ordering. Additionally, the ForeignKey class in django/db/models/fields/related.py is relevant as it defines the behavior of foreign keys, including self-referencing keys. The identified spans, SQLCompiler.get_order_by, Query.setup_joins, and ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields, are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue. These sections deal with the specific mechanics of ordering and joining related tables, which are central to the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
