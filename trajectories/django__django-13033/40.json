The problematic behavior is evident when using the `order_by` method with related fields, leading to unexpected SQL queries with unnecessary JOINs and incorrect sorting orders. The main areas to focus on are the `get_order_by`, `find_ordering_name`, and `setup_joins` methods in the `SQLCompiler` and `Query` classes, as well as the `ForeignKey` and `OrderBy` classes. Additionally, examining the `Order_By` class within `django/db/models/expressions.py` would be beneficial to understand how ordering is handled. Since the issue affects the SQL compilation and query generation process, these areas should be thoroughly investigated for potential bugs or misconfigurations.",

The issue revolves around the handling of self-referencing foreign keys and the ordering of related fields. This suggests that the primary focus should remain on the SQL query compilation and model definition parts of the Django framework. However, since no specific files or code snippets were initially found, widening the scope to include broader query constructions and relational field definitions might be beneficial. Additionally, it could be useful to look into the method resolution order (MRO) handling and the inheritance chain around the definition of models with self-referencing foreign keys.",

The 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' is particularly relevant as it deals with the definition and initialization of foreign keys, including self-referencing ones. Additionally, the 'QuerySet' and 'Query' classes in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' are relevant as they handle the generation and execution of SQL queries, including the ordering clauses.

Specifically, the default ordering on the OneModel class appears to interfere with the explicit order_by() method in the queryset, leading to an incorrect SQL query with unnecessary joins and an unexpected descending sort order.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the Django ORM code that handle the creation and processing of foreign keys, particularly those involving self-referencing relationships. We also need to examine how the ORM constructs SQL queries, especially how it processes order_by clauses and joins.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, we can focus on the following:\n1. The ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in django/db/models/fields/related.py, which define the behavior of foreign keys in Django models.\n2. The Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which constructs SQL queries and handles the interpretation of order_by clauses.\n3. The SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, which translates the Query object into actual SQL.\n\nThese classes and methods are crucial for understanding how Django handles self-referencing foreign keys and applying order_by clauses, which are central to the reported issue. The methods involved in resolving related fields, building filters, and setting up joins will be particularly important for diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
