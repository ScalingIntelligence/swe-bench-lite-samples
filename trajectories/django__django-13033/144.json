The models in question are OneModel and TwoModel, which are part of the Orion app. The problem occurs when ordering the queryset by 'record__root_id', leading to an unnecessary extra join and unexpected DESCENDING sort order. The focus should be on the 'order_by', 'join_parent_model', and 'build_filter' functions in the Django ORM to understand how the ordering and joining mechanisms work with self-referencing foreign keys. Additionally, examining the 'OrderBy' class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' will help understand the ordering behavior in Django.",

The key elements to focus on are the methods related to ordering and join management within Django's ORM. The provided search results include several critical sections of code from Django's QuerySet and SQL Query classes, especially the `order_by` method in `QuerySet` and the `join_parent_model` method in `Query`. These are directly related to managing the ordering of querysets and handling joins in SQL queries, which are central to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `OrderBy` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` is relevant as it handles the ordering expressions themselves. Given this analysis, the identified spans of code should help in understanding and potentially resolving the problem of incorrect ordering with self-referencing foreign keys.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
