Specifically, the problem occurs when ordering by 'record__root_id' in the 'TwoModel' queryset, which results in an unnecessary extra JOIN and DESCENDING sort order. To address this, we should focus on the Django ORM and SQL query generation logic, especially in the 'django/db/models/sql' directory, where classes like 'SQLCompiler' and 'Query' are located. These classes handle the compilation of SQL queries and the setup of JOINs, respectively. Investigating these parts of the codebase should help understand and potentially resolve the issue. Additionally, the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, which contains the 'ForeignKey' class, might also be relevant since it deals with foreign key relationships.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a self-referencing foreign key causing unexpected behavior in the ordering of related fields in Django models. The issue seems to be related to how Django's ORM handles query compilation and joins when ordering by fields through self-referencing foreign keys. \n\nThe search results provide insights into the relevant parts of the Django ORM that could be affecting the behavior described in the issue. I've identified several key spans of code that are directly related to handling foreign keys, ordering, and query compilation in Django.\n\n1. **SQLCompiler class:**\n   - The SQLCompiler class is responsible for compiling SQL queries from Django's ORM. It includes methods for setting up queries (`setup_query`), pre-SQL setup (`pre_sql_setup`), and getting the order by clause (`get_order_by`). These methods are crucial for understanding how Django handles ordering and query compilation.\n   - The `get_order_by` method is of particular interest as it determines the ordering based on the query's order_by attribute and the model's default ordering.\n\n2. **ForeignKey class:**\n   - The ForeignKey class defines the behavior of foreign key fields in Django models. Methods such as `__init__`, `formfield`, and `contribute_to_related_class` are important for understanding how foreign keys are initialized, represented in forms, and how they relate to other models.\n   - The `get_related_selections` method in SQLCompiler could also be relevant for understanding how Django compiles queries involving related fields.\n\n3. **Query class:**\n   - The Query class is the base class for building SQL queries. Methods like `names_to_path`, `setup_joins`, and `add_ordering` are crucial for understanding how Django resolves field names to database paths, sets up joins for related fields, and adds ordering to queries.\n   - The `add_ordering` method is particularly relevant as it handles the addition of ordering clauses to SQL queries.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the identified code spans, it appears that the problem could be rooted in how Django's ORM handles the ordering of related fields, especially when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. The identified code spans provide a good starting point for further investigation to understand why the unexpected behavior is occurring and how it might be corrected.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported is about a self-referencing foreign key not ordering correctly by a related '_id' field. The problem specifically deals with the behavior of the Django ORM's ordering mechanism when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. The user has provided various queryset examples demonstrating the unexpected behavior, such as the presence of an unnecessary extra join and the incorrect sorting order. \n\nIn examining the current file context and the new search results, the relevant code spans appear to be concentrated in the SQLCompiler and Query classes within the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files, respectively. These classes handle SQL query compilation and query setup, which is crucial for understanding and resolving the reported issue. \n\nSpecifically, the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method is responsible for generating the ORDER BY clause of the SQL query. This method processes the ordering fields and determines the SQL syntax for each field, including handling of descending order. The `Query.names_to_path` and `Query.setup_joins` methods are also key, as they parse and set up the joins for related fields within the query, potentially relevant to the self-referencing foreign key issue. \n\nThe `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is also mentioned, as it defines the behavior of foreign keys within Django models, which could indirectly impact the ordering issue if there are any bugs or unexpected behaviors when dealing with self-referencing foreign keys. \n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans should provide a strong basis for further investigation and potential fixes related to the self-referencing foreign key ordering issue.",

  "initial_message": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n"
