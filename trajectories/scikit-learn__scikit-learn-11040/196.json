This is occurring in the 'Neighbors' estimator within the sklearn library. The error should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message or a lenient cast to integer. Relevant classes and methods include `NearestNeighbors`, `KNeighborsMixin`, and `RadiusNeighborsMixin`. The focus should be on these classes and their methods to ensure proper validation and handling of `n_neighbors` parameter. Additionally, it's important to ensure that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should also work as expected. Given the context, the search should target the `base.py` file where some of these classes are defined, as well as other relevant files that might contain the implementations or further type checks for these classes. Directives explicitly state not to include test files in the search, so they should be excluded.",

The provided search results include the `NearestNeighbors` class definition and its `__init__` method, which is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is initially set. This code span is directly relevant to the issue because it involves the parameter that needs validation. To complete the task, we need to ensure that the parameter validation is added to this method to handle the case where `n_neighbors` is a float, either by raising a more helpful error message or by converting it to an integer as suggested in the issue. Given the current context and the search results, I am identifying the `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class as relevant to address the reported issue.",

This causes a TypeError when the 'n_neighbors' value is used internally, as only integer values are expected. The goal is to either enforce stricter parameter validation upfront or to provide a more helpful error message. Additionally, the issue suggests that the method 'kneighbors' should handle float values for 'n_neighbors' as well.\n\nThe existing file context and search results both point to the relevant sections of code. In 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', the `__init__` method of NearestNeighbors does not explicitly validate the type of 'n_neighbors'. In 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', the NeighborsBase class also lacks type validation for 'n_neighbors' in its `__init__` method. The KNeighborsMixin class, which includes the 'kneighbors' method, currently does not handle float values for 'n_neighbors' but sets the stage for potential modifications to accommodate such values.\n\nThe identified code spans involve the initialization and methods responsible for handling neighbor searches, which are directly related to the issue. Although the initial code spans did not include explicit validation, they provide the necessary context to insert such validation or improve error handling.",

The current behavior results in a `TypeError` when `n_neighbors` is a float, which is not caught early enough and does not provide a helpful error message. The suggested solution is to catch this error early and raise a more informative error message or cast the float to an integer. The provided search results include several relevant code spans, notably in the `NeighborsBase`, `KNeighborsMixin`, and `RadiusNeighborsMixin` classes. These spans contain methods such as `__init__`, `_check_algorithm_metric`, `kneighbors`, and `radius_neighbors`, which all interact with the `n_neighbors` parameter. Since the issue involves validation of this parameter, the focus should be on the `__init__` methods and anywhere else where `n_neighbors` is processed. A deeper review of these methods reveals their roles in setting up the estimator, validating parameters, and performing neighbor searches. Based on the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are those that handle the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `NeighborsBase` and `KNeighborsMixin` classes. These spans are essential for addressing the reported issue by either improving error handling or casting the float to an integer to ensure compatibility. The identified relevant code spans include: 1. `NeighborsBase.__init__` and `NeighborsBase._check_algorithm_metric` from `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, 2. `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` from `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, 3. `NearestNeighbors.__init__` from `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`. These spans cover the initialization of the `n_neighbors` parameter and its validation, as well as the method where the `TypeError` is encountered.",

However, in the provided context, there is no explicit type checking or casting of 'n_neighbors' within these methods, suggesting that this aspect might be overlooked, potentially leading to type errors when non-integer values are passed. Further exploration is warranted to ensure that no checks or conversions for 'n_neighbors' exist in other parts of the 'sklearn.neighbors' module, especially in other classes that might extend 'NeighborsBase', 'KNeighborsMixin', or 'RadiusNeighborsMixin'.",
