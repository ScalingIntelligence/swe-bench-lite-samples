The provided search results include two files: 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. In 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', the `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` is found, which initializes the `n_neighbors` parameter. This is relevant because it shows where the parameter is set, but it does not include validation checks. In 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin` is found, which is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used without checking its type. This is directly relevant to the issue as it shows the point where the error occurs due to the float value of `n_neighbors`. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the `__init__` method in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' and the `kneighbors` method in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'.",
