The issue suggests that a float value should be either cast to an integer or a more helpful error message should be raised. After examining the search results, I have identified several relevant code spans in the `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` files. These spans include the `NearestNeighbors` class initialization, the `NeighborsBase` class initialization, and the `KNeighborsMixin` class's `kneighbors` method, which all deal directly with the `n_neighbors` parameter. Specifically, the `NearestNeighbors.__init__` and `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` spans are crucial, as they initialize the `n_neighbors` parameter and use it in neighbor search operations, respectively. These spans currently do not include validation or casting for the float case, which aligns with the reported issue.",
