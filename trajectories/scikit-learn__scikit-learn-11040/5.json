The provided search results include a relevant code span from 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' in the 'KNeighborsMixin' class, specifically in the 'kneighbors' method. This method is responsible for handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter and uses it to check constraints like ensuring 'n_neighbors' is not greater than the number of samples. However, there's no immediate validation or type checking on the 'n_neighbors' parameter at the start of the method that could raise a more helpful error or cast it to an integer. This missing validation aligns with the reported issue and is thus considered relevant.",

This method is likely a part of or related to the classes mentioned in the issue (like 'NearestNeighbors'). Since the core logic of handling 'n_neighbors' (both in terms of usage and validation) is found in the 'kneighbors' method which processes the parameter without any validation or type casting to int, it seems that the file context provides a relevant but incomplete picture. Further files or methods related to this issue may deal with initialization or other aspects where 'n_neighbors' is handled differently. The aspect of validation seems partially addressed by raising ValueError for cases where 'n_neighbors' exceeds the size of the training set, but direct type validation or tolerance for float input is absent. This indicates there's more to identify in the broader codebase context.",

This includes looking at where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is initially set and validated, particularly in the 'NeighborsBase' class as an entry point, and in the '__init__' methods of 'NearestNeighbors', 'KNeighborsClassifier', and other specific implementations.

The provided `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` uses `n_neighbors` directly, but there is no explicit type checking or conversion. The `__init__` method for `NearestNeighbors` and `NeighborsBase` both accept `n_neighbors` but do not enforce it being an integer. The `NeighborsBase` class also has a method `_check_algorithm_metric` that validates the algorithm and metric but doesn't check the type of `n_neighbors`. Adding a type check for `n_neighbors` in the `__init__` methods and/or in the `_fit` method of `NeighborsBase` could resolve this issue.",
