The error occurs when `n_neighbors` is a float, which should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised. Additionally, the issue suggests that the functionality should be extended to handle float values for `n_neighbors` when using `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)`.\n\nFrom the provided search results:\n1. The `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` show the definition of `n_neighbors` as an integer. This is the initial point where type validation or conversion could be implemented.\n2. The `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` show the logic for finding the nearest neighbors. This method currently uses `n_neighbors` directly without any type checking or conversion, which leads to the error when `n_neighbors` is a float.\n3. Finally, `LSHForest` class in `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py` also has a `kneighbors` method similar to `KNeighborsMixin`, but since it's deprecated and not the focus of the issue, it's less relevant.\n\nBased on these findings, the relevant code spans are:\n- The `NearestNeighbors.__init__` span where `n_neighbors` is defined.\n- The `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` span where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used without type validation or conversion.\nThese spans should cover the essential parts of the codebase that need modification or additional checks to address the reported issue.",
