In `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, the `NearestNeighbors` class with its `__init__` method, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is defined.\n2. In `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py`, the `LSHForest` class with its `kneighbors` method, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used.\n3. In `sklearn/neighbors/classification.py`, both `KNeighborsClassifier` and `RadiusNeighborsClassifier` classes with their `__init__` methods, where `n_neighbors` is defined.\n4.

The issue points out that currently, the error is raised at a later stage (in `binary_tree.pxi`), which should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. Additionally, it suggests that the `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should also be supported. From the search results, the primary file of interest is `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, which contains the `NearestNeighbors` class definition and its `__init__` method.\n\nIn the `NearestNeighbors` class, the `n_neighbors` parameter is part of the constructor and does not have explicit validation for type (float vs integer). This oversight allows for the float value to be passed without raising an immediate error, which leads to the Type Error deeper in the code. The relevant code span is `NearestNeighbors.__init__`. This span is essential for adding type checking or casting to ensure that `n_neighbors` is an integer. Additionally, given the nature of the issue, the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` is also crucial, as it deals with the specific method call that would need to handle a float `n_neighbors` more gracefully.\n\nThis analysis suggests that modifications to the `__init__` method in `NearestNeighbors` to handle and validate the `n_neighbors` parameter correctly would address the reported issue. Furthermore, the `kneighbors` method should be scrutinized to ensure it can handle float values (if such handling is intended) or provide clear feedback if not.",

The error message indicates that a float value for `n_neighbors` is causing a `TypeError`. The goal is to either catch this error earlier with a more helpful message or to allow float values and cast them to integers.\n\nI reviewed the current file context and identified that the `NearestNeighbors` class in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` has an `__init__` method where `n_neighbors` is initialized. Additionally, the `KNeighborsMixin` class in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` has a `kneighbors` method that could potentially handle the validation or casting.\n\nFrom the new search results, the `NearestNeighbors` class initialization and the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` are still relevant. However, there is no explicit validation or casting of `n_neighbors` in the provided code spans. The `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` checks if `n_neighbors` is None and assigns it the value of `self.n_neighbors` if it is. But it does not address the type of `n_neighbors`. The issue specified that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should work, which suggests that the method should be able to handle float values for `n_neighbors` and potentially cast them to integers.\n\nGiven the search results, it is clear that the current code does not address the issue of float values for `n_neighbors`. To fix this, we need to add parameter validation or type casting for `n_neighbors` in both the `__init__` method of classes like `NearestNeighbors` and in the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin`.",
