The provided search results include the initialization of the 'NearestNeighbors' class with the 'n_neighbors' parameter, the 'kneighbors' method, and other related methods and classes. The relevance of these code spans is evaluated based on their direct handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter or the core functionality (like fitting and querying neighbors) related to the reported issue. The analysis indicates that the code spans involving 'NearestNeighbors' initialization and 'kneighbors' method are directly relevant to the issue as they handle the parameter in question or utilize its value in their operations. Further, other methods in 'NearestNeighbors' class like 'kneighbors_graph' are seen indirectly related as they extend the functionality related to nearest neighbors but do not themselves grapple with the float-integer issue directly. Hence, it's inferred that the most relevant parts of this search concern the initialization and the 'kneighbors' method, which indicate necessary adjustments for parameter validation or casting.",
