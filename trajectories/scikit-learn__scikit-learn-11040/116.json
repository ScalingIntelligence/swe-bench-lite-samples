The error occurs when trying to use a float value for 'n_neighbors' in the 'kneighbors' method, which leads to a TypeError due to type incompatibility. This issue should be addressed by either converting the float to an integer or by raising a more informative error message. The search results contain the 'kneighbors' method implementation in the 'KNeighborsMixin' class. This method is critical as it directly involves the 'n_neighbors' parameter. The code already includes checks for the 'n_neighbors' parameter, such as ensuring it is not greater than the number of training samples, but it lacks explicit type checking or conversion for non-integer values. Therefore, the 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' span is relevant and should be modified to include the necessary validation or type conversion for the 'n_neighbors' parameter.",
