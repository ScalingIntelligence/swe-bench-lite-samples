The reported issue indicates that a float value for `n_neighbors` causes a `TypeError` downstream in the code, which should ideally be caught earlier with a more informative error message. The focus is on ensuring that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` works as expected, which implies handling or validating the `n_neighbors` parameter at the appropriate stages. From the provided search results, the code spans involving `NeighborsBase.__init__`, `NeighborsBase._check_algorithm_metric`, `NeighborsBase._fit`, `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`, and `RadiusNeighborsMixin.radius_neighbors` are relevant. These spans cover the initialization of parameters, internal checks, fitting of the model, and the methods for finding neighbors, thus addressing the validation and usage of `n_neighbors`. It is crucial to ensure that any float values for `n_neighbors` are either cast to integers if permissible or raise an appropriate error message to guide users in providing correct inputs. The identified spans provide a comprehensive context to start implementing the necessary checks and modifications to handle the `n_neighbors` parameter effectively.",
