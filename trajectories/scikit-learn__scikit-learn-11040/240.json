The user suggests either catching this earlier with a better error message or allowing the float to be cast to an integer. I then reviewed the code spans in the search results that are directly related to the initialization and usage of the 'n_neighbors' parameter, specifically in the NearestNeighbors class and its 'kneighbors' method. These are crucial as they directly deal with the parameter in question. By doing this, I can ensure that the identified code spans are directly addressing the issue. The relevant spans include '__init__' in the NearestNeighbors class where 'n_neighbors' is first defined and accepted, and 'kneighbors' method where 'n_neighbors' is used and expected to work correctly regardless of its type.

The error occurs when attempting to use a float value for `n_neighbors`, and the issue suggests improving validation or casting to integer. Key points to identify are the `NearestNeighbors` class, its `__init__` method, and the `kneighbors` method where `n_neighbors` is used or should be validated.\n\nThe current context shows relevant code spans in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. The `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method are in `unsupervised.py`, and the `kneighbors` method from the `KNeighborsMixin` class is in `base.py`. Additional relevant code spans in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` provide utility functions like `check_array` and `check_X_y` which might be used for validation.\n\nNew search results confirm the presence of `NearestNeighbors` and `KNeighborsMixin` in their respective files, along with relevant utility functions. The `NearestNeighbors.__init__` and `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` methods are still present in the search results, emphasizing their importance in addressing the issue.
