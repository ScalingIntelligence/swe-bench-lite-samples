Specifically, the issue includes a Type Error where a float is being interpreted as an integer. This indicates that there might be a lack of type checking or validation in the initialization of the 'NearestNeighbors' class, where 'n_neighbors' is expected to be an integer but is being accepted as a float without proper validation. Scanning through the provided search results, I have identified the relevant code spans that initialize and handle the 'n_neighbors' parameter within the 'NearestNeighbors' class and its base class 'NeighborsBase'. Specifically, in the 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' and 'NeighborsBase.__init__' spans, I see where 'n_neighbors' is defined and assigned without any explicit type checking or validation to ensure it is an integer. Furthermore, the 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' span is relevant as it handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter when calling the 'kneighbors' method, but it also lacks any validation for the type of 'n_neighbors'. This suggests that adding type validation in these initializations and method would be the appropriate place to address the reported issue.",
