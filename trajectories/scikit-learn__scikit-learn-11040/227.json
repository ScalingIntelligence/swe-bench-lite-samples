The error occurs in the 'binary_tree.pxi' file, but this file isn't directly provided in the search results. The task requires identifying code spans where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is handled or initialized (preferably in Python rather than Cython, as represented by 'pxi' files). In the provided search results, there are several key sections that are pertinent: The __init__ method of the NearestNeighbors class and the kneighbors method within the KNeighborsMixin class. These sections initialize and handle the 'n_neighbors' parameter directly. Additional relevant code spans are also found in the NeighborsBase class, as this class is superclassed by NearestNeighbors and deals with parameter setting such as n_neighbors. These sections should be further examined and potentially modified to implement the desired parameter validation and error handling for the 'n_neighbors' parameter.",
