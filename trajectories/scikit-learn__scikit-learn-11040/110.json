The current implementation allows setting `n_neighbors` as a float, but this results in a `TypeError` downstream when the float value is passed to a method expecting an integer. The solution involves validating the `n_neighbors` parameter to ensure it is an integer at the point of initialization of the `NearestNeighbors` class. The relevant parts of the codebase are where the `n_neighbors` parameter is defined and used. The identified spans are in the `NearestNeighbors` class's `__init__` method and the `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class.

Additionally, the issue specifies that calling 'kneighbors' with a float for 'n_neighbors' should also be considered. From the provided search results and context, the relevant code spans are primarily in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' within the 'KNeighborsMixin' class, specifically in the 'kneighbors' method where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is used and should be checked for type validity. The existing code already ensures that 'n_neighbors' is not greater than the training size, but it does not check its type to ensure it is an integer before proceeding with computations.
