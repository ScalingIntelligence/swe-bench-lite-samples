Relevant classes include NeighborsBase, KNeighborsMixin, RadiusNeighborsMixin, and UnsupervisedMixin. The specific concern is around the kneighbors method which should ideally handle float input better. Based on these indications, focusing the search on the 'neighbors' folder within 'sklearn', targeting classes and functions directly related to these mixins will likely be fruitful.",
