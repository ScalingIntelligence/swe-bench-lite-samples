The current implementation results in a `TypeError` due to the float value being used where an integer is expected. The requirement is to catch this earlier and provide a more helpful error message or, alternatively, to cast the float to an integer. Additionally, the issue suggests that support for float `n_neighbors` in `kneighbors` might be added for leniency.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant parts of the codebase are primarily in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`. The `NeighborsBase` class defines the `__init__` method and the `_check_algorithm_metric` method which are central to understanding how the `n_neighbors` parameter is handled and checked. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` is directly related to the reported issue, as it is the method where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used operationally.\n\nIn `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, the `NearestNeighbors` class inherits from `NeighborsBase` and `KNeighborsMixin`, indicating that it will exhibit similar behavior regarding parameter handling and the `kneighbors` method. The `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` further attests to this, as it also includes the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n\nThese identified code spans are crucial to addressing the problem statement, as they define the main places where parameter validation and functionality related to `n_neighbors` occur. They provide a clear target for adding the necessary parameter checks or adjustments to support float inputs in a user-friendly manner.\n\nFurther investigation is needed in other files to understand if there are additional areas in the codebase where changes might be required to fully implement the desired functionality or where global configurations might inadvertently influence this implementation.\n\nBased on the search results and the contextual understanding of the issue, the relevant code spans identified align closely with the reported issue and offer clear starting points for implementing the necessary changes.",
