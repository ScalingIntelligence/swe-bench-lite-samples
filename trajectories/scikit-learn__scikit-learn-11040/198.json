The error message indicates that a float value cannot be interpreted as an integer, which should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. Additionally, the issue suggests that functionality should be added to make `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` work.\n\nThe current context already identifies relevant code spans in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, particularly focusing on the `NearestNeighbors` class and the `kneighbors` method. These spans include validation checks and the implementation of the `kneighbors` method.\n\nNew search results provide additional context in `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py` and further code spans in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` related to the `kneighbors` method. The `LSHForest` class in `approximate.py` also implements `kneighbors`, though it seems less relevant as it is deprecated. More relevant is the additional span in `base.py` for `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`, which provides a clearer view of the method's implementation and includes checks for `n_neighbors`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans that are most relevant include the initialization and `kneighbors` method in the `NearestNeighbors` class and the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class. These spans are crucial for addressing the issue of parameter validation and ensuring the method can handle float values for `n_neighbors`.",
