The search results provide two relevant files: 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py'. In 'base.py', the 'kneighbors' method of the 'KNeighborsMixin' class handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter and performs checks on it, but does not explicitly check for float values. In 'approximate.py', the 'kneighbors' method of the 'LSHForest' class also handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter but also lacks explicit float validation.

The goal is to catch this earlier with a more helpful error message or to handle the float by casting it to an integer. Additionally, the issue mentions ensuring that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nFrom the search results, we have several relevant code spans:\n1. In `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method includes the logic for handling `n_neighbors` and checks for the number of samples. This is a crucial part of the codebase related to the functionality in question.\n2. The `NeighborsBase.__init__` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` initializes the `n_neighbors` parameter, which could be relevant for validation at the initialization stage.\n3. The `NeighborsBase._check_algorithm_metric` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` performs checks on the algorithm and metric, potentially a place to add validation for `n_neighbors` if it's not already present.\n4. The `LSHForest.kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py` provides an implementation for finding neighbors, which is also relevant to the issue.\n5. The `NearestNeighbors.__init__` method in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is initialized for the `NearestNeighbors` class.\n\nGiven the issue and the search results, I've identified four primary files (`sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py`, `sklearn/neighbors/graph.py`, and `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`) that contain relevant code spans pertaining to the `n_neighbors` parameter's handling and validation.",
