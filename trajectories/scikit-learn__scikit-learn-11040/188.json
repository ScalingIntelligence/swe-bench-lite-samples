The current code in `NearestNeighbors.__init__` does not explicitly validate the type of `n_neighbors`, which leads to a downstream error in `NeighborsHeap.__init__`. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` should also handle the case where `n_neighbors` is provided as a float and either cast it to an integer or raise a more descriptive error.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we find the relevant code spans:\n1. `NearestNeighbors.__init__` in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` which initializes the `NearestNeighbors` class without type checking on `n_neighbors`.\n2. `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` which handles the `kneighbors` query and currently does not specifically address float values for `n_neighbors`.\n\nThese spans should be modified to include type checking and appropriate error handling or type casting for the `n_neighbors` parameter.",
