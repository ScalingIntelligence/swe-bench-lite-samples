This error indicates a lack of parameter validation, which should either raise a helpful error message or handle the conversion to an integer. Given the provided context, it's clear that the NearestNeighbors class is involved, and the error likely originates from the kneighbors method in the KNeighborsMixin. Therefore, focusing on the sklearn/neighbors/base.py file and the NearestNeighbors class in sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py would be a good starting point. Additionally, since the issue involves parameter validation and type checking, sklearn/utils/validation.py might also contain relevant code for ensuring correct parameter types.",

This results in a TypeError when n_neighbors is specified as a float instead of an integer. The goal is to catch this earlier and provide a more helpful error message or auto-cast the float to an integer.\n\nThe search results consist of several files and code spans that seem relevant to the issue: \n1. sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py: This contains the NearestNeighbors class definition and its __init__ method, which initializes the n_neighbors parameter. This directly pertains to the reported issue.\n2. sklearn/utils/validation.py: This file contains utility functions for validating various parameters, arrays, and data. Although the specific _assert_all_finite function might not directly solve the issue, it's utility in maintaining data integrity suggests a deeper dive into validating types like in _num_samples or check_array could relate to handling float to int conversion or error messaging.\n3. Other files like sklearn/neighbors/regression.py and sklearn/neighbors/classification.py deal with subclasses of NearestNeighbors such as KNeighborsRegressor, RadiusNeighborsRegressor, KNeighborsClassifier. However, since the issue is specific to the unsupervised NearestNeighbors class, they might provide context but are less directly relevant to solving the issue at hand.\n\nThe primary goal is to validate the n_neighbors parameter in such a way that it either explicitly checks for integer types and raises an informative error for floats, or automatically casts floats to integers. The NearestNeighbors.__init__ span in sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py would be the direct location to implement or modify such validation directly affecting the reported issue.\n\nThus, the next steps should focus on identifying or implementing the logic that either ensures n_neighbors is an integer or provides a clear error for non-integer types within the __init__ method of the NearestNeighbors class. Utility functions like those found in sklearn/utils/validation.py could serve as a basis for creating or refining this validation.",

The new search results provide the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class within `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. This method is relevant as it uses the `n_neighbors` parameter and currently lacks validation for its type. Additionally, the `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is provided, which may be useful for ensuring the input array is in the correct format, though it does not directly address the float-to-integer issue mentioned in the issue.
