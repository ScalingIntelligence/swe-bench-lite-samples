The issue specifically references the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `kneighbors` method, where a float value for `n_neighbors` should be handled either by casting to an integer or by raising a more informative error. The relevant code spans provide insights into the initialization and usage of the `n_neighbors` parameter within the `NeighborsBase` and `KNeighborsMixin` classes, as well as the `NearestNeighbors` class which inherits from these. Notably, the `NeighborsBase.__init__` span initializes the `n_neighbors` parameter without any type validation, and the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` span does not currently handle non-integer values specifically. Therefore, these two spans are the most relevant for implementing the necessary validation or adjustment.",
