The provided search results include relevant code within the 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' file. The 'KNeighborsMixin' class contains the 'kneighbors' method, which is directly related to the functionality in question. In this method, there is a block of code that handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter and raises an error if it exceeds the number of samples in the training data. This block aligns with the requirement of validating the 'n_neighbors' parameter to ensure it is an integer and does not exceed the number of training samples. However, there is no explicit validation to check if 'n_neighbors' is a float and cast it to an integer or raise a more informative error. This part is missing and needs to be added to address the issue fully. Therefore, the relevant code spans are from the 'KNeighborsMixin' class, specifically the 'kneighbors' method.",
