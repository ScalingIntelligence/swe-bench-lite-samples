This leads to a `TypeError` downstream. The task is to either ensure a more helpful error message is raised or to handle the input more leniently by casting to an integer. The search results include several classes and methods from the `sklearn.neighbors` module, such as `KNeighborsRegressor`, `RadiusNeighborsRegressor`, `NeighborsBase`, `KNeighborsMixin`, `RadiusNeighborsMixin`, and `NearestNeighbors`. These classes and methods handle the initialization, fitting, and querying of neighbor search algorithms.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. The `NeighborsBase` class and its subclasses (`KNeighborsRegressor`, `RadiusNeighborsRegressor`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, `NearestNeighbors`) all have an `__init__` method that includes `n_neighbors` as a parameter.\n2. The `NeighborsBase.__init__` method initializes `n_neighbors` without any type checking or validation.\n3. The `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method is where the actual neighbor search happens, and it uses the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n4. The direct issue of handling a float for `n_neighbors` during instantiation and use in the `kneighbors` method appears to be in the `NeighborsBase` class and its `KNeighborsMixin` mixin.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans need to be identified in the `NeighborsBase` class and the `KNeighborsMixin` mixin, focusing on the handling of the `n_neighbors` parameter.",

To address this, we need to add validation to ensure `n_neighbors` is an integer and provide a more helpful error message if it is not. We also need to ensure that the `kneighbors` method can handle float values for `n_neighbors` and either raise a helpful error or handle the conversion to an integer gracefully.\n\nFrom the provided search results, there are relevant code spans in the `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` file that need to be analyzed. Specifically, the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` and `_check_algorithm_metric` methods are crucial. These methods handle the initialization and validation of parameters, including `n_neighbors`. The current implementation does not explicitly check the type of `n_neighbors`, which could be where the validation needs to be added. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class is relevant as it deals directly with the `n_neighbors` parameter.
