This should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message or be lenient by casting to an integer. The issue also mentions the need to ensure that the NearestNeighbors class and its methods handle this case appropriately.\n\nReviewing the new search results, the file `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` contains the `NearestNeighbors` class definition and its `__init__` method. This file is relevant as it directly involves the instantiation of the `NearestNeighbors` object and setting of its parameters. Notably, the `__init__` method defines the `n_neighbors` parameter but does not include validation or casting to handle float inputs.\n\nThe `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` file contains the `KNeighborsMixin` class, which includes the `kneighbors` method. This method is crucial as it directly interacts with the `n_neighbors` parameter during the nearest neighbor search. The method behavior with float values for `n_neighbors` is pertinent to the issue. Notably, this method uses `n_neighbors` without cast or validation, potentially leading to errors if a float is passed.\n\nLastly, `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py` contains the `LSHForest` class, which also includes a `kneighbors` method. However, this class is marked with a deprecation warning and thus might not be a priority for the current issue addressed.\n\nFrom these results, the code spans within the `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` and the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin` are directly relevant to the issue of missing parameter validation for float `n_neighbors`. These spans are the primary focus for addressing the reported issue.",
