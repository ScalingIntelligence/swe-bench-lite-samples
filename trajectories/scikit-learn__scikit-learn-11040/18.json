The NearestNeighbors class in sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py initializes the n_neighbors parameter without any type checking or conversion. Similarly, the LSHForest class in sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py handles n_neighbors during initialization and in the kneighbors method, but without type validation. The base class NeighborsBase in sklearn/neighbors/base.py also initializes n_neighbors, suggesting that this parameter is central across various neighbor-based estimators. The KNeighborsMixin class also has a kneighbors method that conditionally sets n_neighbors if not provided, but again lacks explicit type validation. This analysis indicates that the primary locations for addressing the issue are within the __init__ methods and the kneighbors method across these classes, focusing on adding type checks or conversions for the n_neighbors parameter.",
