Specifically, the issue mentions that passing a float to `n_neighbors` results in a `TypeError` which is not caught early enough, leading to a less helpful error message. The desired outcome is to either raise a more helpful error message or to accept a float and cast it to an integer.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` file. The `KNeighborsMixin` class contains the `kneighbors` method, which is responsible for handling the `n_neighbors` parameter. This method currently checks if `n_neighbors` is `None` and assigns it the value of `self.n_neighbors` if so. However, it does not explicitly check the type of `n_neighbors`, which could lead to the observed issue.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to add type checking for the `n_neighbors` parameter within the `kneighbors` method to ensure it is an integer before proceeding with the rest of the method logic. This would allow us to catch the error early and provide a more informative error message, or alternatively, cast the float to an integer if that behavior is preferred.\n\nThe identified relevant code spans are within the `KNeighborsMixin` class, specifically the `kneighbors` method.",
