This leads to a `TypeError` when the float is encountered in a place where an integer is expected. The task is to ensure that this error is caught earlier with a more helpful error message. The provided search results include several relevant code spans: 1. The `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` class in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` where the `n_neighbors` parameter is set and passed to the base class. 2. The `__init__` method of the `NeighborsBase` class in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` where `n_neighbors` is assigned to `self.n_neighbors`. 3. The `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin` in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` which uses `n_neighbors`. 4. The `kneighbors` method of `LSHForest` in `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py`, though this class is not directly mentioned in the issue, it still related to neighbor search which might need similar checks. \n\nGiven these code spans, it is clear that the validation for the `n_neighbors` parameter should be added either in the `__init__` methods of `NearestNeighbors` or `NeighborsBase`, or possibly both, depending on how wide the validation should be enforced. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` should also handle or validate the `n_neighbors` parameter to ensure it does not cause errors during execution. Overall, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the `n_neighbors` parameter, its initialization, and its usage in neighbor search algorithms.",

Specifically, the '__init__' method of NearestNeighbors and NeighborsBase define and initialize 'n_neighbors'. Additionally, the 'kneighbors' method in the KNeighborsMixin class is crucial as it uses 'n_neighbors'.\n\nConsidering the goal of enhancing parameter validation for 'n_neighbors', the relevant spans to modify are:\n1. 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' to add validation for 'n_neighbors'.\n2. 'NeighborsBase._fit' to ensure 'n_neighbors' is handled correctly if modified during fit.\n3.
