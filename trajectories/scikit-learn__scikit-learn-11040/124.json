The error message suggests that a float cannot be interpreted as an integer, indicating that type validation might be missing or insufficient. To address this, we need to investigate the `NearestNeighbors` class and other related classes in the `sklearn.neighbors` module. The goal is to ensure that the type of `n_neighbors` is validated correctly and that a meaningful error message is provided if it's not an integer. Additionally, we should explore how the `kneighbors` method handles the `n_neighbors` parameter when it's a float.",

This can lead to errors like the one described, where a 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer. The primary focus should be on the '__init__' method of the NearestNeighbors class and the 'kneighbors' method across different mixins and classes. Existing code spans should be evaluated on how they handle or pass the 'n_neighbors' parameter, specifically looking for validation or type conversion logic that might be missing or needs improvement. The provided search results include the '__init__' method of NearestNeighbors and the 'kneighbors' methods in both LSHForest and KNeighborsMixin.
