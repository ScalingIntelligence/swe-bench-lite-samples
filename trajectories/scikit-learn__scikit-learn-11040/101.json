To address this issue, it's crucial to identify sections of code where 'n_neighbors' is defined, initialized, and used. This includes ensuring type checks and providing appropriate error messages or casting the value to an integer silently. From the provided search results, the relevant sections of code are found in 'NeighborsBase' and 'KNeighborsMixin' classes, particularly in the '__init__', '_check_algorithm_metric', and 'kneighbors' methods. These sections handle the initialization of 'n_neighbors', algorithm and metric checks, and the actual computation of neighbors. By focusing on these parts of the code, we can pinpoint where additional type checks or error handling for 'n_neighbors' should be implemented to avoid the TypeError and to potentially allow for float values to be automatically cast to integers if desired.",

The current implementation results in a `TypeError` when the value is a float, but the error is not caught early enough, and the error message is not helpful. The goal is to either provide a better error message or handle the float input by casting it to an integer. Additionally, the issue indicates that the behavior should be tested further by making sure `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nExamining the provided context and search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are all within `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. The main areas of interest are the `NeighborsBase` class's `__init__` method and the `KNeighborsMixin` class's `kneighbors` method. These are used to initialize the estimator and handle the `kneighbors` search, respectively.\n\nThe `NeighborsBase.__init__` method defines the `n_neighbors` parameter without any type checking or validation, which is one of the issues identified. The `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used but currently assumes it's an integer, which leads to the `TypeError` when a float is provided.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided search results contain the core functionality related to the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `Neighbors` estimator, and these code spans are directly relevant to resolving the reported issue. Thus, the search task is complete.",

The provided file context and search results reveal that the 'NeighborsBase' class, specifically its '__init__' method, sets 'n_neighbors' without any validation. Additionally, the 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin' uses 'n_neighbors' directly without checking its type or value. This analysis indicates that the relevant code spans are in the '__init__' and 'kneighbors' methods of the 'NeighborsBase' and 'KNeighborsMixin' classes. Further analysis is not necessary as these spans sufficiently address the issue by demonstrating where type/value checks for 'n_neighbors' are missing and need to be implemented.",
