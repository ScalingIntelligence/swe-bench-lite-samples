The current behavior leads to a TypeError due to the inability to interpret a float as an integer. To address this, we need to add validation for the 'n_neighbors' parameter, ensuring it is an integer and providing a more helpful error message if it's not. Additionally, we should ensure that something like `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works, potentially by casting a float to an integer. Given the context, the focus should be on the 'NearestNeighbors' class and the 'kneighbors' method within the neighbors module. The relevant files to check are those involving the 'NeighborsBase', 'KNeighborsMixin', and 'NearestNeighbors' classes.",
