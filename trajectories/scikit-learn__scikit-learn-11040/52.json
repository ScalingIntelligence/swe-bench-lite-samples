Additionally, 'NearestNeighbors' inherits from these classes and initializes 'n_neighbors' without type checking.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue identifies a problem with parameter validation in the `Neighbors` estimator for the `n_neighbors` parameter when it is a float. This results in a `TypeError` due to the float being interpreted as an integer. The issue suggests that this should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised, or the float should be cast to an integer. The task also requires ensuring that calling `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, the relevant code spans are found in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`. In `base.py`, the `NeighborsBase` class defines the `__init__` method which initializes `n_neighbors` among other parameters. The `KNeighborsMixin` class in the same file contains the `kneighbors` method which is responsible for finding neighbors. The `NearestNeighbors` class in `unsupervised.py` inherits from `NeighborsBase` and `KNeighborsMixin`, and it also initializes `n_neighbors` in its `__init__` method.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly involve the `n_neighbors` parameter and the methods that handle it. By identifying these spans, we can focus on correcting how `n_neighbors` is handled, whether by adding validation, casting to an integer, or improving error messages. This will resolve the issue and ensure that calling `kneighbors` with a float for `n_neighbors` is either properly handled or a clear error is raised.",
