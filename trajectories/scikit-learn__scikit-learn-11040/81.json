These spans should be considered relevant as they handle the initialization and validation of the `n_neighbors` parameter and perform the fitting of the estimator. Additionally, the relevant code spans also include the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class which is responsible for finding the nearest neighbors and is likely to use the `n_neighbors` parameter.

This method needs to handle the float case for `n_neighbors` and either raise an error or cast it to an integer.\n\nThese spans show where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used and will need to be modified to include proper validation for float values, such as converting them to integers or raising a more helpful error message.",
