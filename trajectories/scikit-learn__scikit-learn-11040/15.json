The current behavior is to raise a TypeError, but the expectation is for it to be caught earlier with a more helpful error message or to automatically cast the float to an integer. The code should also ensure that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` works without error.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant sections appear to be in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. In 'unsupervised.py', the NearestNeighbors class is defined, including an __init__ method where 'n_neighbors' is initially set. In 'base.py', the KNeighborsMixin class, which likely interacts with NearestNeighbors, contains the 'kneighbors' method, suggesting that any validation for 'n_neighbors' not happening during initialization might occur here.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because the former initializes the 'n_neighbors' parameter, and the latter uses this parameter during its method execution. Both sections of code should be inspected and potentially modified to enforce type checking or casting for 'n_neighbors', ensuring it's an integer and providing user-friendly error messages.",
