The error occurs when the float value is passed directly without type checking or casting, leading to an exception during runtime. The search involves identifying the relevant sections of code where `n_neighbors` is defined and utilized, and the location where the error is being raised. The focus is on the `NearestNeighbors` class and its related mixins, particularly the `KNeighborsMixin`, as these contain the `kneighbors` method which handles the `n_neighbors` parameter. The analysis includes examining the constructor (`__init__`) of `NearestNeighbors` and the `kneighbors` method in both `NearestNeighbors` and `KNeighborsMixin` to ensure the parameter is properly validated and utilized. Additionally, the search must verify if there are any other classes or methods that might interact with `n_neighbors` and need similar validation.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it's evident that both `NearestNeighbors` and `KNeighborsMixin` classes have the necessary methods where `n_neighbors` is instantiated and used. The constructor of `NearestNeighbors` includes the definition of `n_neighbors` as an integer default, and the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` handles the parameter by checking its type and using it for further processing. The `LSHForest` class, although included in the search results, is deprecated and thus less relevant for direct implementation changes.
