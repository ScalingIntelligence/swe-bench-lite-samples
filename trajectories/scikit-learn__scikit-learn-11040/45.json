The goal is to either enforce float-to-integer conversion or provide a more meaningful error message. The current context shows that the issue may be originating from the `NeighborsBase` class initialization in `base.py` and possibly the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` also in `base.py`. \n\nReviewing the new search results, several relevant classes and methods are found in different files:\n1. `KNeighborsClassifier` and `RadiusNeighborsClassifier` in `classification.py` extend `NeighborsBase`, indicating they might also need to address the `n_neighbors` validation.\n2. `LSHForest` in `approximate.py` implements its own `kneighbors` method, which should also consider the `n_neighbors` parameter type.\n3. `KNeighborsRegressor` in `regression.py` extends `NeighborsBase` and could also be affected by the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n4. The `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` of `base.py` is present multiple times, indicating it's crucial for implementing the neighbor search and thus needs attention to the `n_neighbors` type.\n5. `NearestNeighbors` in `unsupervised.py`, another class extending `NeighborsBase`, directly involves the `n_neighbors` parameter in its initialization.\n\nConsidering the depth and breadth of the issue, current file context, and newly found implementations of related classes and methods, it's clear that addressing the `n_neighbors` parameter validation requires updates across multiple files and class implementations.",
