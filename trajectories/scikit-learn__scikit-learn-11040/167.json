The provided search results include a relevant section of code from 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', specifically the 'kneighbors' method within the 'KNeighborsMixin' class. This method is critical as it directly handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter. The method currently checks if 'n_neighbors' is None and sets it to the default value if so. It also checks if 'n_neighbors' exceeds the number of available samples and raises a ValueError if it does.

Integration of type checking for 'n_neighbors' and raising a more informative error message or automatically casting to an integer would address the issue effectively.

The `_fit` method of the `NeighborsBase` class, which is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is further utilized and where the type error occurs when attempting to use a float.\n3. The `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class, which directly interacts with the `n_neighbors` parameter and should handle it more gracefully.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the relevant spans are:\n- The `__init__` method in `NeighborsBase`\n- The `_fit` method in `NeighborsBase`\n- The `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin`\n- The `__init__` method in `NearestNeighbors`\n\nThese spans cover the necessary parts of the codebase where parameter validation and handling of `n_neighbors` should be improved to address the issue.",

Given that the mixin method 'kneighbors' in 'KNeighborsMixin' also does not perform type checking, it seems crucial to investigate further to ensure that there is proper validation for the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the context of both initialization and method invocation.
