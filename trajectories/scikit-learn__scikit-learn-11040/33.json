Specifically, when 'n_neighbors' is passed as a float, it should either be cast to an integer or a more helpful error message should be raised. Additionally, the issue highlights the need for ensuring that 'neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)' works as expected.\n\nThe current context and new search results focus on the 'NearestNeighbors' class and its 'kneighbors' method. The 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' method initializes the 'n_neighbors' parameter without any type checking or validation. The 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' method uses this parameter but does not check its type, which leads to the TypeError when a float is passed.\n\nTo address the issue, the 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' and 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' methods need to include validation for the 'n_neighbors' parameter. The validation should ensure that 'n_neighbors' is an integer and provide a clear error message if it is not. Additionally, the 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' method should be able to handle float values for 'n_neighbors' by either casting them to integers or raising an appropriate error.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified are in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' for 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' and in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' for 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors'.
