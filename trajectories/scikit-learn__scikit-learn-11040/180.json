The current implementation in NearestNeighbors and KNeighborsMixin does not explicitly check the type of 'n_neighbors', allowing float values to be passed through, which results in an error. The issue suggests improving the error handling by either casting to an integer or raising a more helpful error message. The search results provide relevant code spans such as the constructor of NearestNeighbors and the kneighbors method in both NearestNeighbors and KNeighborsMixin. These are identified as relevant for addressing the issue because they directly handle the 'n_neighbors' parameter and its usage in the nearest neighbors search. Additionally, the LSHForest class, though deprecated, also addresses similar functionality with 'n_neighbors', making it also potentially relevant for understanding the implementation. Therefore, these spans are crucial for modifying the code to enhance parameter validation or error messaging as suggested by the reported issue.",
