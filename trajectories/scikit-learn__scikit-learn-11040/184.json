The task is to ensure that the code either provides a more helpful error message or allows for the leniency to cast the float to an integer. From the search results, the relevant code spans include the `NearestNeighbors` class definition and its `__init__` method, which sets the `n_neighbors` parameter. Additionally, the `NeighborsBase` class definition and its `__init__` method, and `_check_algorithm_metric` method are relevant, as they handle parameter settings and validations. The `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method are also important as they involve neighbor search functionalities. However, there does not seem to be explicit error handling or type checking for `n_neighbors` parameter anywhere in the provided search results.

This leads to a TypeError when the neighbor estimator tries to use it. The issue suggests either improving the error message or allowing for leniency by casting the float to an integer. The code spans provided in the file context and search results show the `__init__` method and `_check_algorithm_metric` method in `NeighborsBase` and `NearestNeighbors`. These methods set and potentially validate the `n_neighbors` parameter. However, the validation specifically for ensuring `n_neighbors` is an integer seems to be missing, which aligns with the issue reported. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this would be within the `__init__` methods of both `NeighborsBase` and `NearestNeighbors`.",

Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class checks if `n_neighbors` is less than the number of samples in the training data, but it does not validate the type of `n_neighbors`.
