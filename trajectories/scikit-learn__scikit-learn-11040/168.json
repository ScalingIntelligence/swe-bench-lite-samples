This results in a TypeError in the binary_tree.pxi file, which should ideally be caught earlier with a more informative error message. The issue also suggests that the function 'neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)' should work appropriately.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, several relevant sections of code were identified: \n1. The '__init__' method of the NearestNeighbors class in sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py initializes 'n_neighbors' without any type checking or validation.\n2. The 'kneighbors' method in the KNeighborsMixin class in sklearn/neighbors/base.py also does not explicitly check the type of 'n_neighbors', which aligns with the issue at hand.\n3. The '__init__' methods of KNeighborsClassifier and RadiusNeighborsClassifier in sklearn/neighbors/classification.py also lack type checking for 'n_neighbors'.\n4. The NeighborsBase class in sklearn/neighbors/base.py serves as a base class for these neighbor estimators but does not itself directly handle the 'n_neighbors' parameter.\n\nThese sections are relevant because they directly relate to the initialization and usage of the 'n_neighbors' parameter, which is the focus of the reported issue. Specifically, addressing the type validation for 'n_neighbors' in these methods would help resolve the issue and improve the robustness of the estimator.\n\nThus, the identified spans of code are essential for making the necessary changes to validate the 'n_neighbors' parameter and handle the exception more gracefully.",
