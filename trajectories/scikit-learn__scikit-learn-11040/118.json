The current search results include the definition of the NearestNeighbors class in 'unsupervised.py' and the relevant 'kneighbors' method in 'base.py' under the KNeighborsMixin class. Both of these are crucial for addressing the issue. The '__init__' method of NearestNeighbors directly handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter, making it a pertinent location for adding type validation or casting. The 'kneighbors' method in KNeighborsMixin also deals with 'n_neighbors', making it another essential piece of code to ensure consistency and proper handling of the parameter.

The error message should be more helpful or the float value should be cast to an integer. Additionally, the issue suggests ensuring that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works. From the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are identified in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` where the `NearestNeighbors` class is defined, including its `__init__` method and the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin`. Additionally, the `check_array` and `check_X_y` functions in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` should be considered for potential use in validation. These code spans provide the necessary context to address the issue of parameter validation and ensure the float value for `n_neighbors` is handled appropriately.",
