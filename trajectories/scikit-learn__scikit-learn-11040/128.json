The primary focus is on ensuring that the parameter is validated and a more informative error message is raised or that the float is cast to an integer as a lenient solution. Additionally, the issue suggests ensuring that the method 'kneighbors' can handle the 'n_neighbors' parameter passed as a float. In the provided search results, the class 'NearestNeighbors' and its '__init__' method from 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' are relevant as they handle the initialization of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Furthermore, the 'kneighbors' method from the 'KNeighborsMixin' class in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' is also relevant as it directly deals with the 'n_neighbors' parameter during the computation of nearest neighbors. These two code spans are likely where the validation or modification to handle floats should be implemented.",
