Additionally, the issue mentions the need to ensure that the `kneighbors` method handles a float `n_neighbors` appropriately. The search results provide relevant code spans for the `NeighborsBase` class, particularly the `__init__` method where `n_neighbors` is defined and the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class. These methods are essential as they deal directly with the `n_neighbors` parameter and are the primary candidates for adding the necessary validation and handling logic. The provided code does not directly address the issue by adding validation or float handling, but it outlines the baseline implementations where the fix needs to be applied.",

Specifically, the issue arises when 'n_neighbors' is provided as a float, leading to a TypeError. The requirement is to catch this error earlier and provide a more helpful error message or, alternatively, to cast the float to an integer. The additional requirement is to ensure that the method 'kneighbors' can handle a float 'n_neighbors' parameter.\n\nFrom the provided file_context, it's evident that the current implementation of 'kneighbors' in 'KNeighborsMixin' class does not handle the float 'n_neighbors' parameter. It directly uses the 'n_neighbors' value without any type checking or conversion.\n\nThe new search results confirm the presence of the problematic code in the 'kneighbors' method within the 'KNeighborsMixin' class and the 'NearestNeighbors' class that uses this mixin. Additionally, the 'LSHForest' class also contains a 'kneighbors' method that similarly lacks type checking for 'n_neighbors'. These are the relevant code spans that need to be addressed to resolve the issue.\n\nPotential solutions include adding type checking and conversion logic in the '__init__' method of the 'NeighborsBase' class or directly in the 'kneighbors' method to ensure 'n_neighbors' is an integer.",
