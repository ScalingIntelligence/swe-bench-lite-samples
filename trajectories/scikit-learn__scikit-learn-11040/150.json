The error should be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. The relevant code spans are found in the 'NeighborsBase' class within 'base.py', particularly in the '__init__' method and the '_check_algorithm_metric' method, which set up and validate parameters including 'n_neighbors'. Additionally, the 'NearestNeighbors' class in 'unsupervised.py' extends 'NeighborsBase' and overrides the '__init__' method to include 'n_neighbors'. This chain of inheritance and method override suggests that modifications to handle and validate 'n_neighbors' should primarily occur at the base class level in 'NeighborsBase'. Analyzing the code spans confirms that the validation of 'n_neighbors' is currently minimal and does not cover type checking, thus making it a suitable candidate for enhancement. Enhancing this method could also potentially address the request related to improving error messages for invalid parameter types.",
