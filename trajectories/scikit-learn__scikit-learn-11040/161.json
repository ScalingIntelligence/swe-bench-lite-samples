This is exemplified in the example provided, where setting `n_neighbors=3.` raises a `TypeError`. The solution proposed involves either catching this earlier with a more helpful error message or allowing the conversion from float to integer. Given the current context and search results, a few key points to consider are:\n\n1. The `NearestNeighbors` class found in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` includes an `__init__` method that sets the `n_neighbors` parameter. This initialization does not include validation for the type of the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n\n2. The `KNeighborsMixin` class in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` contains the `kneighbors` method. This method also handles the `n_neighbors` parameter but doesn't validate its type initially.\n\n3. The `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is used to validate and preprocess arrays, which might be relevant for ensuring the `n_neighbors` parameter's type consistency across different parts of the code.\n\nConsidering these points, it would be beneficial to add type checking for `n_neighbors` in the `NearestNeighbors` class initializer (especially `__init__`). Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class could benefit from direct type checking to ensure that `n_neighbors` is an integer before proceeding with further computations. Implementing these changes should help address the issue and provide clearer error messages or automatic type correction if deemed appropriate.",
