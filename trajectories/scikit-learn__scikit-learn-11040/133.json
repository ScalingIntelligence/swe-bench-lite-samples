The search results include several relevant code spans, primarily from the `NearestNeighbors` class in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and the base class `NeighborsBase` in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. These spans cover the initialization of the `NearestNeighbors` class, the validation checks for the parameters, and the method for fitting the model. Additionally, the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method, which is part of the `KNeighborsMixin` class in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, is also relevant as it handles the `n_neighbors` parameter during the search for neighbors. These code spans are crucial for identifying where the parameter validation should be added or modified to ensure that `n_neighbors` is an integer and to provide a more informative error message or handle the float input gracefully. Moreover, the context of the entire section within each class is important to understand how the parameters are managed and how errors might be appropriately raised or handled. The search results do not indicate missing references to other parts of the codebase that might be relevant, suggesting that focusing on these identified spans is sufficient to address the reported issue.",
