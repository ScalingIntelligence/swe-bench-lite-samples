The code should either provide a more helpful error message or handle such inputs more gracefully. Relevant parts of the codebase likely involve the `NearestNeighbors` class and methods related to neighbors calculation, particularly those that deal with the `n_neighbors` parameter, such as `kneighbors`. The NearestNeighbors class is located in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and extends from `NeighborsBase` in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. Additionally, the `NeighborsBase`, `KNeighborsMixin`, and `RadiusNeighborsMixin` classes in `base.py` and possibly other mixins in the neighbors module should be inspected to ensure proper handling of the `n_neighbors` parameter. Also, checking for handling around the `kneighbors` method would be crucial.",

The error message suggests that a float value for 'n_neighbors' cannot be interpreted as an integer, leading to a TypeError. The task is to identify relevant code spans where this validation might be added or improved, and to ensure that the 'kneighbors' method can handle a float value for 'n_neighbors' and possibly cast it to an integer.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n1. The '__init__' method in the NearestNeighbors class (span id 'NearestNeighbors.__init__') where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is defined.\n2. The 'kneighbors' method in the KNeighborsMixin class (span id 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors') where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is used.\n3. The '__init__' method in the NeighborsBase class (span id 'NeighborsBase.__init__') which is the base class for NearestNeighbors and likely handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter directly or indirectly.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they involve the definition, initialization, and usage of the 'n_neighbors' parameter.
