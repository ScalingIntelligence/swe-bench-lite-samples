This includes both the constructor (__init__) and the method (kneighbors) where 'n_neighbors' is used. The search results provide the necessary code spans for NearestNeighbors in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' and for KNeighborsMixin in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. These spans cover the initialization and the kneighbors method, respectively. The analysis shows that the code currently does not explicitly check or validate the type of 'n_neighbors' during initialization though it does type checking and other validations in the kneighbors method. This aligns with the requirement to catch the float input earlier and possibly provide a more informative error message.",
