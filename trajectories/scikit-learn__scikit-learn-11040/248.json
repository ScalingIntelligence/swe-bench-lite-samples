The current error message is not helpful and occurs deep in the code, leading to a poor user experience. The task is to identify where and how this validation should be added or improved. The search results provide insights into the implementation of the 'kneighbors' method in two different files. In 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', we find the 'KNeighborsMixin' class with its 'kneighbors' method. This method handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter but does not explicitly check its type. Similarly, in 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', the 'LSHForest' class overrides the 'kneighbors' method, and it also lacks type checking for 'n_neighbors'. Both methods use 'n_neighbors' directly without validation, making them relevant for addressing the issue. Therefore, the focus should be on improving these methods by adding explicit type checks for 'n_neighbors'.",
