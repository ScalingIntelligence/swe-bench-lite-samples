The relevant code spans are those dealing with the initialization and usage of the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `NearestNeighbors` class and its associated methods. The search results show several relevant sections, including the constructor of the `NearestNeighbors` class (`NearestNeighbors.__init__`) and the `kneighbors` method (`KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`). These sections will need to be modified to include the necessary validation checks. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method of the `LSHForest` class should also be considered, although it does not directly pertain to the `NearestNeighbors` class, it is part of the neighbors module and could impact the functionality if similar issues exist.
