This leads to a TypeError that should be caught earlier, possibly with a more informative error message. Additionally, the report suggests that \u201cneighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)\u201d should also work, possibly hinting at type coercion.\n\nGiven the file context and search results, the relevant parts of the codebase involve the NeighborsBase class in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', specifically the __init__ method where 'n_neighbors' is initially defined and the _check_algorithm_metric method where validation checks on parameters are performed. Additionally, the KNeighborsMixin class in the same file, particularly the kneighbors method, is pertinent as it deals directly with the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the context of the kneighbors function. Lastly, the check_array function in 'sklearn/utils/validation.py' likely has a role in type validation or coercion, although it's not directly invoked in the identified spans.\n\nTaking these into account, the identified spans from 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' seem relevant to address the issue at hand, focusing on where 'n_neighbors' is defined and used, and where validation/error handling might be improved. The span from 'sklearn/utils/validation.py' also hints at broader validation functionalities that might influence how the float handling could be addressed.\n\nThese observations help guide where modifications could be made to improve validation and error handling for the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the NearestNeighbors estimator.",
