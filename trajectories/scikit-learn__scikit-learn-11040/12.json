The error occurs when attempting to use a float value for `n_neighbors`, leading to a `TypeError`. The goal is to either improve error handling or convert the float to an integer. The search results include several relevant code spans:\n\n1. In `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, the `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class includes the `n_neighbors` parameter, which defaults to 5 but does not explicitly check or convert the type.\n\n2. In `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py`, the `__init__` method of the `LSHForest` class also includes `n_neighbors` without type checking or conversion.\n\n3. In `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, the `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class uses `n_neighbors` and checks if it is None but does not validate its type. The method also handles the case where `n_neighbors` is greater than the number of training samples, raising a `ValueError`.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly involve the `n_neighbors` parameter and how it is used or passed along in the classes that inherit or use it.

The relevant code spans include the NearestNeighbors class definition and its __init__ method from unsupervised.py, the LSHForest class and its __init__ method from approximate.py, and the KNeighborsMixin class with its kneighbors and kneighbors_graph methods from base.py.\n\nThe new search results confirm the presence of the KNeighborsMixin class and its kneighbors and kneighbors_graph methods in base.py. The kneighbors method is crucial as it directly involves the handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. There are no new files or methods in the search results that are directly related to the NearestNeighbors class or its __init__ method, which suggests that the primary focus for resolving the issue lies within the base.py file and the implementation of the KNeighborsMixin class.\n\nGiven the context and search results, the relevant code spans are those in the KNeighborsMixin class within base.py, particularly the kneighbors method, as this is where the parameter 'n_neighbors' is used and where the error handling or type casting should be implemented to address the issue.",
