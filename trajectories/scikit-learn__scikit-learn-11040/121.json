Therefore, the focus of the search should be on the NearestNeighbors class and its associated methods, especially _check_anti_slice and kneighbors.

The `_check_algorithm_metric` method checks various parameters including algorithm and metric but doesn't touch on `n_neighbors` type validation directly. The `kneighbors` method from the `KNeighborsMixin` class does some validation on the `n_neighbors` value to ensure it's not greater than the number of training samples, but it doesn't check its type (whether it's an integer).
