This lack of validation is causing errors downstream when `n_neighbors` is a float.\n3. **Propose a solution**: To address this, a type check should be added in the `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` to ensure that `n_neighbors` is an integer. If it is not, a meaningful error message should be raised.\n4. **Verify integration with other methods**: Given the extension of `NearestNeighbors` from several mixins and base classes, it is important to ensure this validation does not interfere with other functionalities such as `kneighbors`, which uses `n_neighbors`.\n\nGiven the provided search results, the specific spans of code that are relevant include the `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class and the corresponding base classes where `n_neighbors` is first defined and used. The approach to integrate this validation should be carefully considered to ensure it is both effective and does not introduce new issues.",

The issue mentions a TypeError due to incorrect type handling in the NeighborsHeap.__init__ method, which suggests that the validation or type casting for the 'n_neighbors' parameter is missing or inadequate in the NearestNeighbors class. The provided file context shows the __init__ method of the NearestNeighbors class and the abstractmethod of NeighborsBase class in base.py, revealing that no explicit type checking or conversion is performed on the 'n_neighbors' parameter. The new search results include the kneighbors method in KNeighborsMixin, which also deals with the 'n_neighbors' parameter. This method currently does not perform any explicit type checking or conversion, making it a likely candidate for the error mentioned in the issue. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans are the __init__ method of the NearestNeighbors class in for conducting proper type checking or conversion on the 'n_neighbors' parameter, as well as the kneighbors method in KNeighborsMixin for ensuring consistent handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the execution flow of the NearestNeighbors estimator.",
