The task is to either improve the error handling to provide a more informative error message or to accommodate the float input by casting it to an integer. The relevant code spans to look into should involve the initialization and use of the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the NearestNeighbors class and its related methods. From the search results, the following spans appear to be relevant: \n\n1. **NearestNeighbors class initialization (`NearestNeighbors.__init__`)**: This is where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is first defined and set. Modifying this part to include type checking or conversion could solve the issue at its root.\n2. **kneighbors method (`KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`)**: This method is used to find the k-nearest neighbors and also handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Ensuring this method can handle and possibly cast a float to an integer for 'n_neighbors' would address the immediate problem when calling this method with a float.\n\nThese spans are directly related to the handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter and should be the focus for addressing the current issue.

Specifically, it highlights that a float value for `n_neighbors` results in a TypeError, and it is suggested that this should be caught earlier with a more helpful error message or automatic casting to an integer. Additionally, the issue mentions that it should also work with the `kneighbors` method when `n_neighbors` is a float.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, there are several relevant code spans:\n\n1. The `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` where the `n_neighbors` parameter is defined without any validation.\n2. The `kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` within the `KNeighborsMixin` class. This method is directly related to the issue as it deals with the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n3. Another occurrence of the `kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py` within the `LSHForest` class, though this code snippet does not explicitly handle the validation of `n_neighbors`.\n4. The `kneighbors_graph` and `radius_neighbors` methods also in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` provide context but are not as directly relevant as the `kneighbors` method.\n\nTo address the issue, the most relevant code spans are those handling the `n_neighbors` parameter in `NearestNeighbors.__init__` and `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`. The next steps would involve adding parameter validation to these methods to ensure `n_neighbors` is an integer, either by raising a more informative error or by casting it to an integer while ensuring it does not lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nThe provided search results are sufficient to address the reported issue, as they contain the necessary code spans for both the initialization and the method invocation of the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `NearestNeighbors` estimator.",

These methods are crucial for understanding parameter handling and for implementing the necessary updates or validations.\n\nThe `check_array` function from `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is also relevant as it ensures that the input arrays adhere to certain properties and data types. Given the need to ensure 'n_neighbors' is an integer, this function could be utilized or adapted to include checking for integer types specifically for this parameter.\n\nFinding additional code that directly references the 'n_neighbors' attribute or validates its type would be beneficial.
