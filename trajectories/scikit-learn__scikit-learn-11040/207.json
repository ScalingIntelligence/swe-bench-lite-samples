The error occurs when attempting to interpret a float as an integer, leading to a TypeError. The solution should involve validating the n_neighbors parameter earlier in the process and providing a more informative error message when an invalid type is detected. Given this context, relevant sections of code need to be identified where n_neighbors is defined, validated, and used. After analyzing the provided code spans from 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', it's apparent that the NearestNeighbors class and related functions (like kneighbors, __init__, _check_algorithm_metric, etc.) are tasked with handling the initialization, fitting, and querying of neighbor searches. These spans must be examined for appropriate validation or modification to properly handle float inputs for n_neighbors and generate appropriate error messages or automatically convert to integer where necessary. The search results found in the 'approximate.py' file do not relate directly to the NearestNeighbors class handling or n_neighbors parameter validation. Therefore, the attention is focused on the 'base.py' file sections. None of the currently reviewed sections directly address the type checking issue for n_neighbors, suggesting this task requires further investigation or modification in the already identified sections, to implement the necessary type checks for n_neighbors in these functions.",

The error should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised. Additionally, the issue suggests that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should also work.\n\nReviewing the current context and search results, the relevant parts of the codebase are primarily in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, focusing on the `NeighborsBase`, `KNeighborsMixin`, and `RadiusNeighborsMixin` classes. These classes handle the initialization of `n_neighbors`, the parameter validation, and the `kneighbors` method.\n\nThe search results confirm the presence of the mentioned classes and their methods, providing a comprehensive view of how `n_neighbors` is handled. Specifically, the `NeighborsBase.__init__` and `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` methods are crucial for understanding how `n_neighbors` is managed and how the `kneighbors` method behaves with different types of `n_neighbors` values.\n\nGiven the existing context and the new search results, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue.

This issue leads to a TypeError because the 'n_neighbors' parameter should be an integer. The goal is to provide a more helpful error message or to cast the float to an integer. Additionally, the issue specifies that the following should work: `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.).` \n\nUpon reviewing the existing codebase, particularly within 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', it is observed that the `NeighborsBase` class initializes with `n_neighbors` but does not validate its type. The `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class also interacts with the `n_neighbors` parameter without checking its type.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code spans should include the initialization of the `NeighborsBase` class and the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class. These spans are necessary because they define how `n_neighbors` is handled and are likely where type validation and error handling should be added to resolve the issue.",
