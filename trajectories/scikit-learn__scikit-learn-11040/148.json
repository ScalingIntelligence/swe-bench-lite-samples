The objective is to ensure that either a more helpful error message is raised or the float is leniently cast to an integer, and that the function works with the given example. The search results include code spans from 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. The 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' file contains the NearestNeighbors class definition and its __init__ method, which initializes the 'n_neighbors' parameter. The 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py' file contains the LSHForest class, which also uses the 'n_neighbors' parameter in its __init__ and kneighbors methods. The 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' file contains the KNeighborsMixin class, which includes the kneighbors method used across several estimators, including NearestNeighbors and LSHForest. Given these findings, it's likely that modifications to the parameter handling in NearestNeighbors, especially around validation and type conversion, would be necessary. Additionally, adjustments in the base class method KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors might also be required to ensure consistency and proper handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter across different neighbor-based estimators.",
