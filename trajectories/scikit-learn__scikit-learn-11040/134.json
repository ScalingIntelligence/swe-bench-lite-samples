The error occurs when 'n_neighbors' is provided as a float, which should ideally be an integer. The goal is to either provide a more helpful error message or handle this case by casting to an integer. Relevant files and classes include NearestNeighbors, KNeighborsClassifier, RadiusNeighborsClassifier, KNeighborsRegressor, and LocalOutlierFactor, all of which inherit from NeighborsBase and have methods that involve 'n_neighbors'. Additionally, the base.py file contains the KNeighborsMixin class with the kneighbors method, which is directly related to this issue.",
