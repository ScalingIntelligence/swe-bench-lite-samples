Specifically, the issue arises when 'n_neighbors' is a float, leading to a TypeError. The task is to ensure that this type of error is caught earlier and a more helpful error message is raised. Additionally, it should support the 'n_neighbors' parameter as a float in the 'kneighbors' method. After analyzing the provided code spans, it is clear that the relevant sections are in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. The '__init__' method of 'NearestNeighbors' in 'unsupervised.py' and the 'kneighbors' method across the files should be examined and potentially modified to handle float values for 'n_neighbors' and perform appropriate type checking. The 'kneighbors' method in 'base.py' also needs to be inspected to ensure it handles the float 'n_neighbors' correctly without raising an error. Overall, these sections of code need to be updated to meet the requirements of the reported issue.",
