This leads to a TypeError. The provided search results contain two files: 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py'. In 'base.py', the 'KNeighborsMixin' class has a 'kneighbors' method which is likely relevant to the issue. This method handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter but does not explicitly check or rectify the type of 'n_neighbors' if it is not None. In 'approximate.py', the 'LSHForest' class also has a 'kneighbors' method that similarly processes 'n_neighbors' without type checking. Both methods could benefit from validation of the 'n_neighbors' parameter to ensure it's an integer, which would align with the need to handle the reported issue of float input gracefully. Both files are relevant as they contain the 'kneighbors' method, which is central to the issue described. The scan across large documentation containing debug information continuity comes from a multitude of small files and I dont rapid envision how much information is connected until i see large     bird-eye visualization which noticed enlarged patterns. simple large bird-eye visualization prior.
