The search results include relevant code spans from 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'.

In 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', the NeighborsBase class is identified with its __init__ and _check_algorithm_metric methods, which are foundational for neighbors-based learning methods. Additionally, the KNeighborsMixin class with its kneighbors method is relevant as it handles the neighbor search algorithm, though it does not validate the 'n_neighbors' parameter directly.

The issue suggests either catching the float value error earlier and providing a more helpful error message, or casting the float to an integer. I examined the code spans provided in both the current context and the new search results to identify the relevant code that deals with the initialization and usage of `n_neighbors`.\n\nFirstly, the `__init__` method in the `NearestNeighbors` class sets a default value for `n_neighbors` and passes it to the superclass `NeighborsBase`. The `NeighborsBase` class initializes `n_neighbors` and checks its validity using the `_check_algorithm_metric` method. This method is defined in the same class and checks the algorithm and metric parameters, but does not specifically validate the type of `n_neighbors`.\n\nSecondly, the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class uses `n_neighbors` for querying the nearest neighbors. It checks if the `n_neighbors` value provided is valid but does not check the type explicitly.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans to address the issue are in the initialization (`__init__` methods) and the `kneighbors` method, where `n_neighbors` is set and used, respectively. Further implementation or modification in these parts of the code would likely resolve the issue of handling non-integer `n_neighbors` values.\n\nI have identified the following spans as relevant to the reported issue:\n- `NearestNeighbors.__init__` for setting the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n- `NeighborsBase.__init__` for initializing `n_neighbors`.\n- `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` for using `n_neighbors`.\n\nThese spans cover the necessary parts of the codebase where modifications can be made to address the issue.",

From the provided file context, it is evident that the constructors of 'NeighborsBase' and 'NearestNeighbors' do not perform validation checks on the 'n_neighbors' parameter to ensure it is an integer. Additionally, the 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin' does not handle the case where 'n_neighbors' is a float either, which is in line with the reported issue. This suggests that the relevant code responsible for handling or validating 'n_neighbors' is indeed present in the file context, but currently lacks the functionality to address the issue.
