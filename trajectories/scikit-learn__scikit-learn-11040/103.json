The error occurs when using a float, and it should be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. Additionally, the issue also suggests making sure that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nThe current file context shows relevant parts of the NearestNeighbors class, including its __init__ method where 'n_neighbors' is defined. The search results provide further context about the NeighborsBase class, which NearestNeighbors inherits from, and the KNeighborsMixin class, which contains the kneighbors method.\n\nReviewing the search results:\n\n- NeighborsBase class contains the base implementation of '__init__' where 'n_neighbors' is set, and a method '_check_algorithm_metric' that checks the validity of the algorithm and metric.\n- KNeighborsMixin class contains the 'kneighbors' method where the logic for finding neighbors is implemented.\n\nBased on the issue description, the relevant code spans are in the __init__ method of the NeighborsBase class and the kneighbors method in the KNeighborsMixin class. Both of these methods need to ensure proper handling and validation of the 'n_neighbors' parameter to avoid the reported error. Specifically, the __init__ method should validate the type of 'n_neighbors' to be an integer and raise a helpful error message if it's not. The kneighbors method should handle floating-point 'n_neighbors' values gracefully if the validation in __init__ is not sufficient or direct.\n\nThese identified spans should help address the issue by improving parameter validation and handling in the NearestNeighbors estimator.",

The file context provided includes sections from `NearestNeighbors` and `base.py`, which interact closely with the `n_neighbors` parameter. The `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` does not explicitly validate the type of `n_neighbors`, which could lead to the issue observed when a float is passed. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class also does not check the type of `n_neighbors`. This suggests that the area for modification and validation is clearly identified within the provided context. However, there are potential dependencies and checks within the broader `NeighborsBase` class initialization and `_check_algorithm_metric` method that may also need to consider type-checking for `n_neighbors`, though these specific details are not shown in the given context.",
