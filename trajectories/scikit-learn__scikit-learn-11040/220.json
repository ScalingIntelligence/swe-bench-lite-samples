The relevant files to look into are sklearn/neighbors/base.py and sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py for the NearestNeighbors class and related mixins. It's also important to check the method where n_neighbors is used and validated, likely in the KNeighborsMixin methods.",

This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less\n        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.\n\n        Distance matrices are not supported.\n\n        Valid values for metric are:\n\n        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',\n          'manhattan']\n\n        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',\n          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',\n          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',\n          'yule']\n\n        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n        metrics.\n\n    p : integer, optional (default = 2)\n        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from\n        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this is\n        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance\n        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.\n\n    metric_params : dict, optional (default = None)\n        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.\n\n    n_jobs : int, optional (default = 1)\n        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.\n        If ``-1``, then the number of jobs is set to the number of CPU cores.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n      >>> import numpy as np\n      >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n      >>> samples = [[0, 0, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\n      >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(2, 0.4)\n      >>> neigh.fit(samples)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n      NearestNeighbors(...)\n\n      >>> neigh.kneighbors([[0, 0, 1.3]], 2, return_distance=False)\n      ... #doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n      array([[2, 0]]...)\n\n      >>> nbrs = neigh.radius_neighbors([[0, 0, 1.3]], 0.4, return_distance=False)\n      >>> np.asarray(nbrs[0][0])\n      array(2)\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    KNeighborsClassifier\n    RadiusNeighborsClassifier\n    KNeighborsRegressor\n    RadiusNeighborsRegressor\n    BallTree\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    See :ref:`Nearest Neighbors <neighbors>` in the online documentation\n    for a discussion of the choice of ``algorithm`` and ``leaf_size``.\n\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm\n    \"\"\"\n\n\\n    def __init__(self, n_neighbors=5, radius=1.0,\\n                 algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, metric='minkowski',\\n                 p=2, metric_params=None, n_jobs=1, **kwargs):\\n        if n_neighbors is not None:\\n            if not isinstance(n_neighbors, int) or n_neighbors <= 0:\\n                raise ValueError(\\\"n_neighbors must be a positive integer\\\")\\n            n_neighbors = int(n_neighbors)\\n        super(NearestNeighbors, self).__init__(\\n              n_neighbors=n_neighbors,\\n              radius=radius,\\n              algorithm=algorithm,\\n              leaf_size=leaf_size, metric=metric, p=p,\\n              metric_params=metric_params, n_jobs=n_jobs, **kwargs)\\n\n```.\n\nMake sure that you return the unchanged code in the replace tag exactly as it is.
