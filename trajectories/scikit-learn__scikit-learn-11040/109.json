In the `LSHForest` class, also an implementation of `KNeighborsMixin`, `n_neighbors` is similarly initialized. The `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` class is where `n_neighbors` is used, defaulting to `self.n_neighbors` if not provided directly in the method call. There's a check to ensure `n_neighbors` doesn't exceed the number of training samples, but no explicit type validation or handling for non-integer values such as floats. It seems the TypeError is likely happening within the internals of the methods or functions called, such as `pairwise_distances` or within the tree structures used for efficient neighbor searching.

In the `LSHForest` class, also an implementation of `KNeighborsMixin`, `n_neighbors` is similarly initialized. The `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` class is where `n_neighbors` is used, defaulting to `self.n_neighbors` if not provided directly in the method call.

The current implementation should catch such cases earlier and raise a more helpful error message, or cast the float to an integer. The search results provided include various classes and methods related to the `NearestNeighbors` estimator and its mixins. Notably, the `NearestNeighbors.__init__` and `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` methods are relevant as they deal directly with the `n_neighbors` parameter. Additional files like `base.py` and `classification.py` also provide context on how the `n_neighbors` parameter is handled in different scenarios, which could be useful for understanding the overall structure and for potential modifications. The search results do not appear to include specific error handling related to the type of `n_neighbors`, which could be necessary for resolving the issue.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the relevant code spans should focus on the `n_neighbors` parameter handling across different parts of the `NearestNeighbors` estimator and its mixins, particularly in the `__init__` and `kneighbors` methods. These regions will likely require updates to include type checking and appropriate error handling for non-integer values of `n_neighbors`.",
