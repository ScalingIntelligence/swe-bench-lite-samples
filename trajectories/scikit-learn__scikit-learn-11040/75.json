The provided code example indicates that a TypeError is raised when `n_neighbors` is a float, and it's not caught early enough. The goal is to either provide a more helpful error message or automatically cast the float to an integer.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`:\n1. In `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, the constructor of the `NearestNeighbors` class is identified where the `n_neighbors` parameter is initially set. This is the entry point where parameter validation could be added.\n2. In `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, the `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class is important. This method is where the `n_neighbors` value is used and checked. Enhancing the error handling or adapting the type here would directly address the issue.\n\nThese two code spans are crucial for addressing the reported issue because they cover both the initialization and the function usage of the `n_neighbors` parameter. The existing implementation lacks specific validation or casting for the `n_neighbors` parameter when it's a float, which leads to the TypeError described in the issue. Enhancing the validation in the constructor and the method where the parameter is used will resolve this issue.",
