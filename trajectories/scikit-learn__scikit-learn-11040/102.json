The search results provide relevant code spans across multiple files that define the NearestNeighbors class, its initialization, and the kneighbors method. The '__init__' method in NearestNeighbors and NeighborsBase sets up the 'n_neighbors' parameter, which needs to be validated. Additionally, the 'kneighbors' method in both NearestNeighbors and LSHForest potentially handles how 'n_neighbors' is used, making these code spans relevant for addressing the issue. To ensure the issue is resolved, we should validate the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the '__init__' method or at the point of usage in 'kneighbors'.
