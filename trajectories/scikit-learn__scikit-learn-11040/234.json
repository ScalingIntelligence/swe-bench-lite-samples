To address this, it's crucial to identify where 'n_neighbors' is defined and used within the NeighborsBase and KNeighborsMixin classes. From the search results, the following spans appear relevant: 'NeighborsBase.__init__' where 'n_neighbors' is initialized, 'NeighborsBase._fit' where 'n_neighbors' is used during fitting, and 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' where 'n_neighbors' is used in the kneighbors method. These spans will help in understanding and potentially modifying the code to prevent the TypeError and implement improved validation or error handling.",

The mixin's kneighbors method, where the error occurs, does not currently cast 'n_neighbors' to an integer or explicitly check its type before using it. However, the issue suggests a need for better error handling or type coercion around the 'n_neighbors' parameter, which could be implemented in the initialization of NeighborsBase or within the kneighbors method.
