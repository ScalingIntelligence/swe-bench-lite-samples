There are two primary tasks: 1) Ensure that an error is raised with a helpful message when n_neighbors is a float, and 2) Ensure that the kneighbors function can handle the n_neighbors parameter as a float in some cases. To address this, we should focus on the NearestNeighbors class and its related mixins in the sklearn/neighbors directory. The main classes and functions to check are NearestNeighbors and kneighbors.

Additionally, the issue mentions the need to confirm that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` works.\n\nFrom the current file context and search results, the relevant code spans are found in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. These files contain the definitions for the `NearestNeighbors` class and its base class `NeighborsBase`, as well as the `KNeighborsMixin` class with the `kneighbors` method. The `NeighborsBase.__init__` method and the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method are particularly relevant as they handle the initialization and implementation of the nearest neighbor search, respectively. The search results confirm the presence of these methods, indicating that further actions may involve adding or modifying validation checks for the `n_neighbors` parameter within these methods.",
