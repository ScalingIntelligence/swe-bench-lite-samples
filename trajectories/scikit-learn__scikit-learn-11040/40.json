In `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method where the `n_neighbors` parameter is initially defined.\n2. In `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py`, the `LSHForest` class and its `kneighbors` method where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used.\n3. In `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, the `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method, which is likely inherited by `NearestNeighbors`.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they involve the definition and usage of the `n_neighbors` parameter, which is central to the reported issue.
