Specifically, it needs to handle cases where 'n_neighbors' is provided as a float and ensure it either raises a helpful error message or converts it to an integer seamlessly. The relevant classes to focus on are NearestNeighbors, KNeighborsClassifier, RadiusNeighborsClassifier and their respective mixins like KNeighborsMixin and RadiusNeighborsMixin. The '_check_algorithm_metric' method in 'NeighborsBase', and the 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin' are likely places to start. Additionally, it's important to ensure that 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin' handles the float 'n_neighbors' appropriately.",
