The issue points out that the error should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised, or alternatively, the float could be cast to an integer. Furthermore, the issue suggests ensuring that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nReviewing the file context, we have identified that the NearestNeighbors class is located in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', inheriting from NeighborsBase and KNeighborsMixin located in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. The __init__ method of NearestNeighbors implicitly inherits the parameter validation logic from NeighborsBase's __init__ method, which sets the n_neighbors attribute without type checking.\n\nIn the new search results, pertinent spans include 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' which initializes the class and sets default parameters including n_neighbors. Additionally, from 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', 'NeighborsBase.__init__' and 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' are relevant since they define the parameter and the method where the error is encountered, respectively.\n\nAkin to the earlier identified spans, the new 'LSHForest.kneighbors' in 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py' does not directly pertain to the issue at hand as it pertains to a different class unrelated to the NearestNeighbors' n_neighbors parameter validation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans from both the file context and the new search results are pertinent to the issue, indicating where the necessary code changes should be made to address the issue. Specifically, adding parameter type validation or conversion to handle 'n_neighbors' as a float should be implemented in the '__init__' method of the classes outlined. However, no additional relevant spans were identified in the new search results other than those already noted. Thus, the search for relevant code spans can be considered complete based on current findings.",
