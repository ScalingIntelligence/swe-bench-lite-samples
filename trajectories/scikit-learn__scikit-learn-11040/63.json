While not directly related to the issue at hand, understanding how other neighbor-related classes handle similar parameters can be insightful.\n3. The `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` handle the `n_neighbors` parameter across different methods and provide insight into how the parameter is processed during the estimation process. This is highly relevant as it shows where and how the `n_neighbors` parameter is used in the neighbor search.\n\nBased on the report and reviewing relevant sections of the code, the relevant code spans are identified in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`.",
