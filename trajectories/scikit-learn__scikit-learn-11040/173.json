The NearestNeighbors class and its __init__ method are crucial as they define the parameter and its default value. Similarly, the KNeighborsClassifier class and its __init__ method are relevant because they also use the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Additionally, the KNeighborsMixin class and its kneighbors method are important as they handle the logic for finding the nearest neighbors, which directly involves the 'n_neighbors' parameter. These spans provide the necessary context to implement parameter validation and ensure that the input for 'n_neighbors' is correctly handled, potentially including type checking and conversion if appropriate.

This leads to a TypeError because the float is not interpreted as an integer, which should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. Additionally, the issue specifies the need to ensure that 'neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)' works correctly.\n\nReviewing the current context, the NearestNeighbors class is already identified, including its __init__ method where 'n_neighbors' is initially defined. The KNeighborsClassifier class and its __init__ method are also present, indicating where 'n_neighbors' is set for classification tasks.\n\nThe new search results introduce additional components of the NearestNeighbors functionality, including the NeighborsBase class and its methods like _check_algorithm_metric, _fit, and _pairwise. The KNeighborsMixin class, which includes the kneighbors method, is also detailed. This method directly relates to the functionality regarding the 'n_neighbors' parameter and its handling.\n\nRelevant code spans include the initial definitions of 'n_neighbors' in NeighborsBase and KNeighborsClassifier, and the functionality relating to 'n_neighbors' within the kneighbors method inside KNeighborsMixin. The _check_algorithm_metric method within NeighborsBase, while not directly validating 'n_neighbors', sets the stage for the conditions under which the algorithm is chosen, which is indirectly relevant to how 'n_neighbors' is treated.\n\nOverall, the provided code spans within base.py, unsupervised.py, and classification.py are relevant to address the issue, particularly those dealing with initialization and the kneighbors method.",

The error should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised, or the float value should be cast to an integer. Additionally, the issue mentions that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should also work.\n\nI have examined the current file context, which includes the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, and the `KNeighborsClassifier` class with its `__init__` method in `sklearn/neighbors/classification.py`. The `NeighborsBase` class, which both `NearestNeighbors` and `KNeighborsClassifier` inherit from, has been reviewed for common functionality and methods like `__init__`, `_check_algorithm_metric`, `_fit`, and `_pairwise` in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`.\n\nFrom the new search results, I revisited the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__`, `_check_algorithm_metric`, `_fit`, and `_pairwise` methods. Additionally, I examined the `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method to understand how `n_neighbors` is used.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are in the `NeighborsBase` class's `__init__` and `_fit` methods for handling the `n_neighbors` parameter, as well as in the `KNeighborsMixin` class's `kneighbors` method, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used in the context of finding neighbors. These sections need adjustments to either validate the type of `n_neighbors` or handle float values appropriately.",

The 'KNeighborsClassifier' class uses a utility function '_check_weights' to validate the 'weights' parameter, which suggests that there might be similar utility functions for other parameters. However, none of them directly address the validation of 'n_neighbors' or type coercion to handle float values.
