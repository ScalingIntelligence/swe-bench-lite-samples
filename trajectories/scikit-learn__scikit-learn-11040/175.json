The error is caught only during runtime, but it should ideally be caught during initialization with a more helpful error message. The provided search results primarily focus on the 'kneighbors' method in the 'KNeighborsMixin' class, but do not explicitly show checks for type validation of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. However, the 'NeighborMixin' class contains the method 'kneighbors' which directly involves the 'n_neighbors' parameter handling. It is evident that there is no immediate type checking or casting within this method. To resolve the issue, a type check or conversion should be implemented within the 'kneighbors' method or perhaps the initialization phase of the Neighbors estimator to ensure 'n_neighbors' is an integer. Given the relevance of the 'kneighbors' method in handling 'n_neighbors', this code span is identified as relevant. However, the search is not complete as it does not yet address where and how to implement the type checking to prevent the runtime error which the issue describes.",

The changes ensure that a `ValueError` is raised if the `n_neighbors` value cannot be safely cast to an integer, providing a more user-friendly error message and handling. With this implementation, the issue reported is fully addressed, and the code is now robust against the provided use case.",
