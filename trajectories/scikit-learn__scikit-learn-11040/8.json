This is currently causing a TypeError because it cannot be interpreted as an integer. Additionally, the issue suggests that either a more helpful error message should be raised or the float value should be cast to an integer.\n\nReviewing the current file context, we see the `kneighbors` method within the `KNeighborsMixin` class does handle the `n_neighbors` parameter but does not specifically address the float issue. This method checks if `n_neighbors` is `None`, sets it to `self.n_neighbors` if so, and then proceeds with further checks and operations without type validation.\n\nThe new search results show the `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is defined. This method sets up the initial state of the `NearestNeighbors` object but does not perform any validation on the `n_neighbors` parameter at this stage.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are critical for addressing the issue because the `kneighbors` method is directly involved in processing the `n_neighbors` parameter during runtime, and modifying this method to include type checking for `n_neighbors` could help in resolving the issue. Additionally, the `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class could also be a good place to add type validation if validation at initialization is preferred or necessary.",
