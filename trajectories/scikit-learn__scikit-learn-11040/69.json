The goal is to catch this error earlier and provide a more helpful error message or to allow for the float value to be cast to an integer silently.\n\nI analyzed the code spans provided in the search results. The 'NearestNeighbors' class and its '__init__' method are identified as potentially relevant since this is where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is defined and initialized. The 'NeighborsBase' class and its '__init__' method also appear relevant as it is the base class for 'NearestNeighbors' and the 'n_neighbors' parameter is set here.\n\nIn the 'NeighborsBase' class, the '_check_algorithm_metric' method was inspected, but it does not directly handle the type checking for 'n_neighbors'. The 'KNeighborsMixin' class and its 'kneighbors' method are also inspected, as this method uses the 'n_neighbors' parameter. However, no direct type checking or handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter is found here either.\n\nGiven the current search results, there isn't specific code identified that directly addresses the issue of validating or casting the 'n_neighbors' parameter from float to integer.
