The current implementation does not handle float values for 'n_neighbors', leading to a TypeError due to type mismatch. The task is to identify the relevant code spans where the parameter validation and possibly the assignment of 'n_neighbors' occur. In the provided search results, the 'NeighborsBase' class in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' contains the '__init__' method, which is a likely place where 'n_neighbors' is set and potentially validated. This spans the broad area where an update might be needed to either enforce integer type or provide a more informative error message. Furthermore, the '_fit' method within the same class is responsible for initializing the algorithm and setting up the parameters, which could also benefit from a type check for 'n_neighbors' to avoid runtime errors later. These observations suggest that updates to the '__init__' method of the 'NeighborsBase' class and possibly checks within the '_fit' method would be necessary to address the issue.",
