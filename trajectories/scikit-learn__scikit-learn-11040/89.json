The error occurs when a float is unintentionally passed as `n_neighbors`, leading to a `TypeError`. We need to ensure that appropriate checks are in place to handle this scenario with a more informative error message or auto-casting to an integer. There are two possible approaches: (1) add validation checks in the `NearestNeighbors` class or related mixins handling `n_neighbors`, or (2) modify the `kneighbors` method to handle float inputs more gracefully. Additional overarching validation utilities in `sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py` or `sklearn/utils/validation.py` might also be relevant for broader parameter validation checks.",
