This is directly relevant as it handles the initialization of the `n_neighbors` parameter which is at the core of the issue.\n   - **sklearn/neighbors/base.py**: Several spans were identified including `NeighborsBase`, `KNeighborsMixin`, and others. However, the focus should be on `NeighborsBase`'s `_check_algorithm_metric` method which seems to handle metric and algorithm validation but lacks specific parameter type validation.\n   - **sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py**: The `LSHForest` class and its `kneighbors` method were found. This is indirectly relevant as it also deals with nearest neighbors but is an alternative algorithm.\n\n   Based on the alignment with the reported issue, the `NearestNeighbors` class's `__init__` method in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and the `NeighborsBase` class's methods in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` are the most relevant as they directly involve handling the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The identified spans in `NearestNeighbors` and `NeighborsBase` provide the necessary context to implement or improve parameter validation for the `n_neighbors` parameter. Additional validation logic should be added in these classes to handle the case where `n_neighbors` is a float and ensure a helpful error message is raised or the float is automatically cast to an integer.",

The traceback indicates that the error is encountered downstream in the `NeighborsHeap` class, but the intention is to catch this error earlier and provide a more useful error message. The current context highlights code in `NearestNeighbors` and `NeighborsBase` that sets up the `n_neighbors` parameter. The new search results confirm that `NearestNeighbors` inherits from `NeighborsBase` and that both classes have an `__init__` method where `n_neighbors` is set without validation. This indicates the need to add validation logic to these classes to ensure that `n_neighbors` is an integer, handling potential float inputs in a user-friendly manner. To achieve this, additional code needs to be written or modified within these classes to include checks and/or conversions for the `n_neighbors` parameter. Due to the absence of specific code or methods to implement the validation or conversion logic in the provided context or search results, this task is not yet complete. More context or a strategy to implement the necessary validation or conversion is required.",
