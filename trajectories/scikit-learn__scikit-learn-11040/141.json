The goal is to either catch this type error earlier and provide a more helpful error message or to adapt the function to handle float values by casting them to integers. Given the context, it's essential to locate the implementation of the NearestNeighbors class and its `kneighbors` method to ensure proper parameter validation and handling.",

The current code results in a TypeError due to the float value not being interpreted as an integer. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that handle the initialization and usage of the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the NearestNeighbors class, and potentially in related classes and methods. From the provided search results, several spans are relevant, particularly those in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. These spans include the '__init__' method of the NearestNeighbors class, the 'kneighbors' method in LSHForest and KNeighborsMixin. These methods are directly involved in the setup and usage of the 'n_neighbors' parameter and hence are critical for addressing the issue. Therefore, the identified spans should include those that pertain to the initialization and method calls related to 'n_neighbors' in these classes and methods.",
