The goal is to catch this earlier and raise a more helpful error message, or cast it to an integer. Additionally, the issue mentions ensuring that 'neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)' also works. I will analyze the provided code spans to identify relevant sections that deal with parameter validation and initialization of 'n_neighbors'. From the provided context, the '__init__' method of 'NearestNeighbors' and 'NeighborsBase' classes initialize the 'n_neighbors' parameter. However, there is no explicit validation for the type of 'n_neighbors' in the provided code. In the 'kneighbors' method of 'KNeighborsMixin', the handling of 'n_neighbors' involves checking if it is None and then using the instance's 'n_neighbors' value, but again, no type validation is present. From the search results, the '__init__' method for 'NearestNeighbors' and 'NeighborsBase' confirm the initialization of 'n_neighbors' without type checking. The 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin' also confirms the use of 'n_neighbors' without checking its type. Given this analysis, I will identify the relevant code spans for further action.",
