The error occurs when trying to use a float value for `n_neighbors`, and it results in a `TypeError` due to the value not being interpreted as an integer. The focus should be on the initialization and validation of the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `NearestNeighbors` class. The relevant code spans in the search results involve the `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is defined and passed to the base class `NeighborsBase`. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class should be examined to ensure that it can handle the `n_neighbors` parameter correctly, especially if it is passed as a float.\n\n From the search results, the relevant files and spans are:\n 1. sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py: The `__init__` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is set.\n 2. sklearn/neighbors/base.py: The `__init__` method of the `NeighborsBase` class, which is called by `NearestNeighbors` to initialize `n_neighbors`.\n 3. sklearn/neighbors/base.py: The `kneighbors` method of the `KNeighborsMixin` class, which is responsible for finding the nearest neighbors and may need to handle the `n_neighbors` parameter if it is passed as a float.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they directly involve the initialization and usage of the `n_neighbors` parameter, which is at the core of the reported issue.",
