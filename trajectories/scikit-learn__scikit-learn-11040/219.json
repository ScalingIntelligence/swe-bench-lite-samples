This results in a TypeError because a float cannot be interpreted as an integer. The search results include relevant code spans in the `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, `sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py`, and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` files. In `unsupervised.py`, the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method are found, which is directly related to the initialization of the `n_neighbors` parameter. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method in the `base.py` file is relevant as it involves handling the `n_neighbors` parameter during querying. While `approximate.py` deals with a different estimator, the `LSHForest` class and its `kneighbors` method also handle the `n_neighbors` parameter, which could be relevant for implementing a consistent solution. Overall, these code spans provide a good starting point for addressing the issue by adding parameter validation or adjusting the handling of the `n_neighbors` parameter.",
