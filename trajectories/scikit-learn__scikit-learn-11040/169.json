The issue involves the need for better parameter validation or conversion to an integer to prevent TypeErrors during execution, as well as ensuring that the error message is more informative. Given this, the most relevant code spans are those within the NearestNeighbors class in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', particularly the __init__ method where parameter initialization occurs, and the kneighbors method in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', which is where the 'n_neighbors' manipulation in queries occurs.
