Specifically, the issue highlights that passing a float for 'n_neighbors' should ideally be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised. Additionally, it suggests that the `kneighbors` method should handle the case where 'n_neighbors' is a float. The current context provided includes relevant code spans from `NearestNeighbors` and its methods in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. The new search results provide additional context in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` and expand on the `NeighborsBase` class methods. Given the context, it's clear that validation of 'n_neighbors' currently occurs in `NeighborsBase.__init__` but does not explicitly check for the type of 'n_neighbors', which could be a float. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method also does not handle the case where 'n_neighbors' is float. The identified spans in these files are relevant to addressing the issue, as they allow for the implementation of type checking and potential float coercion.",
