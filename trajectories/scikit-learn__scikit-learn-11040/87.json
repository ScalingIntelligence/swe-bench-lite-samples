The current file context and newly provided search results contain key methods related to the 'NearestNeighbors' class and its 'kneighbors' method which are critical for addressing the issue. Relevant code spans include the '__init__' method of 'NearestNeighbors', the 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin', and validation checks in 'NeighborsBase' which could be extended or modified to solve the problem. Additionally, reviewing the 'NeighborsBase' class in the new search results shows potential for implementing the required validation, albeit it is currently marked as an abstract method, suggesting it might need to be defined further in derived classes. Overall, the identified code spans provide a base for addressing the issue by either adding input validation directly in these methods or by refining how input types are processed.",

The 'LSHForest' class in 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py' also deals with 'n_neighbors', but it's currently deprecated.\n\nGiven the issue, it appears that the validation should occur in the 'NeighborsBase' class during initialization or in a dedicated validation method.
