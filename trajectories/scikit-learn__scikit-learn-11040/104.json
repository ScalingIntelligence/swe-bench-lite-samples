This issue should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message, or possibly even interpreted correctly if cast to an integer.\n\nIn the provided search results, the `NearestNeighbors` class definition and its `__init__` method are found in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`. The `NeighborsBase` class, which `NearestNeighbors` inherits from, is also significant as it contains methods like `_check_algorithm_metric` and `_fit` which might be relevant if additional validation or handling is needed.\n\nThe `NeighborsBase.__init__` method includes assignments for `n_neighbors`, but there is no explicit validation checking its type or value. Similarly, in `NearestNeighbors.__init__`, the `n_neighbors` parameter is passed to the superclass's `__init__` but again, there's no validation. This lack of validation aligns with the issue reported, where a float value for `n_neighbors` bypasses expected handling of this parameter.\n\nFurthermore, the `KNeighborsMixin` class includes the `kneighbors` method, which takes `n_neighbors` as an argument but does not validate its type or value at this level. This method is critical for both using and testing the expected functionality related to `n_neighbors`.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans provide a clear direction for addressing the reported issue. Modifications would likely need to be made in both `NearestNeighbors` and `NeighborsBase` constructors to include appropriate type checking for `n_neighbors` before any operations that might cause TypeErrors due to its value or type.",

There is a utility method '_check_algorithm_metric' in 'NeighborsBase' that validates other parameters; this suggests adding a specific check in 'NeighborsBase' for 'n_neighbors' to ensure it's always cast as an integer and handle any exceptions stating that it should be an integer might be a solution.

The error occurs when trying to use a float value for `n_neighbors`, and it should be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. The relevant code spans need to be identified where the validation for `n_neighbors` should be added or improved. We have identified the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method, as well as the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` method, where the `n_neighbors` parameter is defined and set. We also identified the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class, which uses the `n_neighbors` parameter. Additional validation should be added in these areas to handle the case where `n_neighbors` is a float.",

There is a utility method '_check_algorithm_metric' in 'NeighborsBase' that validates other parameters; this suggests adding a specific check in 'NeighborsBase' for 'n_neighbors' to ensure it's always cast as an integer and handle any exceptions stating that it should be an integer might be a solution.
