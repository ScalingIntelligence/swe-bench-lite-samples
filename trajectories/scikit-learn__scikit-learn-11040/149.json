The specific problem is that the 'n_neighbors' parameter, which should be an integer, is being passed as a float, leading to a TypeError. The goal is to ensure that either a better error message is raised or the float value is cast to an integer before processing. Given the context, the most relevant files appear to be those in the neighbors module, particularly those that deal with the NearestNeighbors class and its methods. Also, focusing on areas where parameter validation or type casting might occur would be beneficial. The base.py file seems particularly relevant as it contains the base classes and methods that might be handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter.",

The relevant code spans to address this issue are in the `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` for parameter initialization and the `kneighbors` method in `KNeighborsMixin` for the implementation of the nearest neighbors search. These code spans need to be updated to handle float inputs for `n_neighbors`, either by converting them to integers or by raising a more informative error.
