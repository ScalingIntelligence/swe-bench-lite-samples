Additionally, it is suggested that the method should also work when the 'n_neighbors' parameter is passed directly to the 'kneighbors' method as a float.\n\nThe search results provide key sections of the code related to the NearestNeighbors class and its methods. The 'NearestNeighbors' class initiation (__init__) is found, which includes the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Additionally, the 'kneighbors' method in the 'KNeighborsMixin' class is also identified, which is crucial as it directly involves handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter during its execution. These are the main areas of interest as they directly involve the handling and processing of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. No other sections seem directly relevant to the issue at hand, focusing primarily on the parameter's handling in initialization and its use in querying neighbors.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the identified spans in 'unsupervised.py' (NearestNeighbors.__init__ and KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors) are deemed relevant as they directly affect how the 'n_neighbors' parameter is handled and interpreted by the NearestNeighbors estimator.",

The task is to ensure proper validation and potentially handle float input more gracefully or provide a better error message.\n\nIn the current file context provided, the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method are already identified, which is relevant as it initializes the `n_neighbors` parameter. The new search results include the `KNeighborsMixin` and `RadiusNeighborsMixin` classes, which provide the `kneighbors` and `radius_neighbors` methods, respectively. These methods are relevant because they interact with the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n\nBased on the analysis of the search results:\n- The `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method directly uses the `n_neighbors` parameter and is responsible for handling the querying logic.\nTherefore, this method is highly relevant to address the issue as the float `n_neighbors` is likely to cause an error here.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are crucial for addressing the issue reported.",

Additionally, the issue suggests ensuring that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nThe current context includes relevant files and spans related to the `NearestNeighbors` class and the `kneighbors` method. The new search results provide further context around these classes and methods.\n\nRelevant code spans are identified in the `NearestNeighbors.__init__` method for validation and type casting of `n_neighbors`, and in the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method where the `n_neighbors` parameter is handled. These spans are crucial for understanding how `n_neighbors` is currently processed and where improvements can be made to address the issue.\n\nThe identified spans include initialization code and the method where the parameter is used, which is sufficient to understand the current handling and to propose changes that would either cast the float to an integer or raise an appropriate error.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified, and the search task is considered complete as they cover the necessary aspects of the reported issue.",

The method currently relies on internal logic to handle `n_neighbors`, including checks for `n_neighbors` being larger than the number of samples, but does not explicitly check if `n_neighbors` is an integer. There is also no type validation in the `__init__` method of `NearestNeighbors` where `n_neighbors` is first initialized. This oversight could be the root cause of the error when a float is passed for `n_neighbors`. To address this, explicit type checking should be implemented in both the initialization of `NearestNeighbors` and within the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin` to ensure that `n_neighbors` is always an integer.",
