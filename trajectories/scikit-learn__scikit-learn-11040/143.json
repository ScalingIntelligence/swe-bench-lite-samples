This leads to a TypeError when the estimator is used with a float for 'n_neighbors'. The task is to ensure that a more helpful error message is raised or to make the conversion to integer internally. The search results provide relevant code spans from several files that are likely to be involved in handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter and the kneighbors method.\n\nFrom 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', the initialization of the NearestNeighbors class includes the 'n_neighbors' parameter, which is set to 5 by default but can be user-defined. This is the likely location for adding validation.\n\nFrom 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', the LSHForest class also has a kneighbors method, but this seems less directly relevant to the issue as it pertains to the NearestNeighbors class.\n\nFrom 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', there are multiple relevant code spans. The NeighborsBase class includes the 'n_neighbors' parameter in its initialization and also has a _check_algorithm_metric method that might be a suitable place to add validation logic. The KNeighborsMixin class contains the kneighbors method, which is the method called with the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the issue description and is thus highly relevant.\n\nConsidering these code spans, the NearestNeighbors.__init__ and NeighborsBase.__init__ code spans are particularly relevant because they deal directly with the initialization and setting of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Additionally, the KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors code span is relevant, as this method is where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is used.

Specifically, the 'check_array' and 'as_float_array' functions are useful for ensuring the correct data type. However, these functions are currently not used in the code spans provided in the context for 'NearestNeighbors' or 'KNeighborsMixin'.\n\nGiven the issue report, the identified code spans that need modification are in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' for 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' for 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors'. Both methods need to include checks ensuring that 'n_neighbors' is an integer before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, the '_assert_all_finite' function in 'sklearn/utils/validation.py' could be relevant for handling inf or nan values, but it's not directly related to the current issue. Therefore, no new spans directly address the issue of ensuring 'n_neighbors' is an integer.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no additional code span identified in the new search results that directly addresses the reported issue of missing parameter validation for 'n_neighbors' in the Neighbors estimator. Therefore, the search task for finding relevant code spans is not complete.",
