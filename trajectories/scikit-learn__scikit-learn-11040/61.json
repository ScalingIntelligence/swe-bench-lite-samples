The goal is to ensure proper type checking and helpful error messages for 'n_neighbors' to avoid this TypeError, and perhaps to extend support for float values where appropriate.",

The provided code example results in a `TypeError` because `n_neighbors` is set as a float, which causes the algorithm to fail. The task is to catch this error earlier and provide a more informative error message. Upon reviewing the search results, the relevant code spans can be identified. The constructor of the `NearestNeighbors` class (`NearestNeighbors.__init__`) initializes `n_neighbors` without type checking. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin` uses `n_neighbors`, which also should be checked to handle float values correctly if it wasn't validated at initialization. In terms of utility functions, `check_array` from `sklearn.utils.validation` is used to validate arrays throughout the codebase and could be used to add type checking on `n_neighbors` or provide a more detailed error message if a float is not allowed. Thus, the critical spans of code to handle the reported issue are the constructor of `NearestNeighbors` and the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin`.",
