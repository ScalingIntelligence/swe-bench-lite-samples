This should ideally be caught earlier with a more helpful error message or possibly cast to an integer. To address this, we need to locate the relevant code where n_neighbors is handled, specifically in the classes that are part of the NearestNeighbors estimator hierarchy, including the base class and any mixins that might handle this parameter. A specific focus should be on the `kneighbors` method as indicated in the issue. Additionally, since the goal is to ensure comprehensive parameter validation, it would be beneficial to also look at utility or helper functions related to parameter validation or type checking across all related classes and functions.",

This should ideally raise an error early with a helpful message or automatically cast to an integer. 2. Reviewing the current file context: No relevant files have been identified yet. 3. Processing new search results: 3.1. `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` - This file contains the `NearestNeighbors` class and its `__init__` method which initializes `n_neighbors`. This is directly relevant as it is where parameter validation or conversion should occur. 3.2. `sklearn/utils/validation.py` - This file contains utility functions for parameter validation such as `check_array` and `check_consistent_length`. These functions are used throughout the codebase for validation, which makes this file relevant if we need to enhance parameter validation. 3.3. `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` - This file contains base classes for neighbors-based learning. Exploring if there is a place in these base classes for parameter validation or if the issue might propagate through here. 3.4. Other files (`classification.py`, `regression.py`, `lof.py`, `estimator_checks.py`) also contain classes extending or using the `NeighborsBase` and related mixins. While they are not directly modifying `n_neighbors`, they should be reviewed to ensure that changes made will not impact their functionalities or if there are supportive functions needed in validation.",
