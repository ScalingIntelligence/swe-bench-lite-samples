'NearestNeighbors.__init__' in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py': This method initializes the NearestNeighbors class and sets the 'n_neighbors' parameter without any type checking.\n2. 'NeighborsBase.__init__' in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py': This is the base class for NearestNeighbors and also initializes 'n_neighbors' without type checking.\n3.

It also raises an error if 'n_neighbors' is greater than the number of samples, which is relevant to the issue.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the codebase does not currently validate the type of 'n_neighbors'.
