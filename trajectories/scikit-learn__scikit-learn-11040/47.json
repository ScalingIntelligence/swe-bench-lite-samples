When 'n_neighbors' is a float, it results in a TypeError because 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer. The goal is to catch this error earlier and provide a more helpful error message or cast the float to an integer. Additionally, it is mentioned that 'neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)' should also work.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py'. In 'base.py', the 'NeighborsBase' class contains the '__init__' method where 'n_neighbors' is initialized, but there is no validation for its type. The '_fit' method also processes 'n_neighbors' without type-checking. The 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin' class also handles 'n_neighbors' but does not check for its type.\n\nIn 'unsupervised.py', the 'NearestNeighbors' class is defined, which inherits from 'NeighborsBase' and 'KNeighborsMixin'. The '__init__' method in 'NearestNeighbors' also initializes 'n_neighbors' without validation. This indicates that the core functionality related to 'n_neighbors' is in 'base.py', and any changes for validation should probably be made there to ensure consistency across different estimators like 'NearestNeighbors'.\n\nGiven the identified code spans, it suggests that the existing implementations do not include explicit type-checking for 'n_neighbors', which aligns with the reported issue. These spans cover the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be addressed to fix the issue.",
