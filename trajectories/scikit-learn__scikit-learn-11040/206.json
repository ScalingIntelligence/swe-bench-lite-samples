The error occurs during the call to 'kneighbors', which suggests that the type check and potential conversion (or error handling) for 'n_neighbors' should be done before this method is invoked. From the search results, it's evident that the 'NearestNeighbors' class and the 'KNeighborsMixin' class both play a role in how 'n_neighbors' is handled. Specifically, the '__init__' method of 'NearestNeighbors' sets the default and accepted values for 'n_neighbors', and the 'kneighbors' method of 'KNeighborsMixin' actually uses this parameter to find neighbors. These two methods are likely where improvements are needed to ensure that 'n_neighbors' is always an integer, either by converting it silently or by raising an appropriate error if it's not. The 'LSHForest' class, which also includes a 'kneighbors' method, seems less relevant as it pertains to a deprecated and different part of the codebase not mentioned in the issue.",

Currently, if 'n_neighbors' is a float, it causes a TypeError because it expects an integer. The goal is to either enforce stricter validation to catch this error earlier with a more helpful message or to automatically cast the float to an integer. The search results provide relevant code spans in the 'NearestNeighbors' class and the 'KNeighborsMixin' class, specifically in the '__init__' method of 'NearestNeighbors' and in the 'kneighbors' method of 'KNeighborsMixin'. These are the areas where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is defined and used, respectively. The 'check_array' function from 'sklearn.utils.validation' also appears relevant for potential validation enhancements.",
