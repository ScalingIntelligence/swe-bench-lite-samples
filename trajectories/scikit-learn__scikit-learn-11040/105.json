The provided file context and search results contain critical sections of the code relevant to the NearestNeighbors class and its methods, especially concerning the initialization and the kneighbors method. These sections handle the setting and use of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. The task is to identify the most relevant code spans that directly relate to the handling and validation of the 'n_neighbors' parameter to address the issue effectively. By analyzing the search results, especially the spans from 'NearestNeighbors.__init__', 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors', and the validation functions in 'sklearn/utils/validation.py', we can pinpoint areas where parameter validation or type checking should be improved to enforce that 'n_neighbors' is always treated as an integer within the NearestNeighbors class.",

A validation mechanism does exist in 'sklearn.utils.validation' by the 'check_array' function, but it does not directly address the specific type requirements for 'n_neighbors'. Therefore, new validation should be added to use either a decorator or explicit check in the constructor of 'NeighborsBase' class or within methods directly involving 'n_neighbors'. Given the file context provided lacks any such specific validation checks for 'n_neighbors', this task is incomplete till additional file context that shows how 'n_neighbors' gets initialized and used in a broader scope, especially in those methods that require it to be an integer is unearthed.
