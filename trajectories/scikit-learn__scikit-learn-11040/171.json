The issue also suggests that a type check or conversion should be implemented to handle float values gracefully or provide a more informative error message. Upon examining the search results, I have identified the relevant code spans in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` where the `NearestNeighbors` class is defined, including its constructor (`__init__` method) where `n_neighbors` is initially set. This is the primary location where parameter validation should be added to ensure `n_neighbors` is an integer, or to handle float inputs appropriately. Thus, the relevant file and code span have been identified as needed to address the reported issue.",

The current implementation does not explicitly check for the type of n_neighbors, which leads to a TypeError when the float value is used due to an internal method expecting an integer. The task is to ensure that either a more helpful error message is raised when a float is passed or that the float is cast to an integer for the sake of leniency. Also, the functionality of neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.) should be supported.\n\nReviewing the provided file context, there is a definition for the NearestNeighbors class and its __init__ method in 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py'. While this is relevant, the implementation of the n_neighbors parameter assignment and validation is not fully covered in the provided spans.\n\nTurning to the search results, key sections include the NeighborsBase class, particularly the __init__ method where the n_neighbors parameter is assigned without validation. Additionally, the _check_algorithm_metric method does some checks but does not validate the type of n_neighbors. Furthermore, the KNeighborsMixin class's kneighbors method is where the n_neighbors parameter is used, but again, there is no type validation there either. This suggests that the relevant code spans are those in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' that deal with the n_neighbors parameter across different classes and methods.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive solution, it is recommended to focus on the __init__ methods of NeighborsBase and NearestNeighbors, as well as the kneighbors method in KNeighborsMixin for potential type checks or transformations on the n_neighbors parameter.",

These sections are crucial for understanding how `n_neighbors` is set and used within the class.
