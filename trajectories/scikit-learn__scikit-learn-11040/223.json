The traceback indicates a TypeError because a float cannot be interpreted as an integer. To address this, we need to identify the parts of the code where 'n_neighbors' is initialized and used. The search results provide valuable context:\n1. In 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', the 'NearestNeighbors' class is initialized with 'n_neighbors' as a parameter. This initializes the class, but we need to check if it handles float values correctly.\n2. In 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', the 'LSHForest' class also has an 'n_neighbors' parameter, but it is somewhat unrelated as it involves a deprecated feature.\n3. In 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', the 'KNeighborsMixin' class has a 'kneighbors' method that directly uses 'n_neighbors'. This method is likely where the error is triggered.\nThe primary focus should be on the 'NearestNeighbors' initialization and the 'kneighbors' method in 'KNeighborsMixin'. These sections are critical for understanding and addressing the issue of type validation for 'n_neighbors'.",
