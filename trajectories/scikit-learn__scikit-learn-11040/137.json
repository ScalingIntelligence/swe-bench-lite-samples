The issue also mentions handling the error with a more helpful message or casting the float to an integer. The search results focus on three files: 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', 'sklearn/neighbors/approximate.py', and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. The NearestNeighbors class and its __init__ method are found in 'unsupervised.py', which initializes the 'n_neighbors' parameter without any validation on its type. The KNeighborsMixin class in 'base.py' contains the kneighbors method, which is also relevant as it directly involves the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Both these classes and methods are directly implicated in handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. The LSHForest class in 'approximate.py' is also relevant due to its inheritance from KNeighborsMixin, but as it is deprecated, its relevance is secondary. Based on the analysis, the identified spans are from 'unsupervised.py' for the NearestNeighbors class and __init__ method, and from 'base.py' for the KNeighborsMixin class and kneighbors method. These are key areas where parameter validation and error handling for 'n_neighbors' can be implemented.",
