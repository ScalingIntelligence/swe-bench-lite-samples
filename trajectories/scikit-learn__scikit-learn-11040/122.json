The error should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised. Additionally, it mentions that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should also work.\n\nFrom the provided file context, the relevant code spans include the initialization of the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` method, which sets the `n_neighbors` parameter. There's also the `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class, which handles the `n_neighbors` parameter during the `kneighbors` call.\n\nIn the new search results, additional relevant code spans are identified:\n1. The `_check_algorithm_metric` method in the `NeighborsBase` class, which checks the validity of the algorithm and metric.\n2. The `_fit` method in the `NeighborsBase` class, which handles the fitting of the model.\n3. The `kneighbors` method in the `KNeighborsMixin` class, which is crucial for the `kneighbors` functionality.\n4. The `radius_neighbors` method in the `RadiusNeighborsMixin` class, although not directly related to the issue, is part of the mixins used by `NearestNeighbors`.\n5. The `fit` method in the `SupervisedIntegerMixin` and `UnsupervisedMixin` classes, which are part of the mixins used by `NearestNeighbors`.\n\nThese additional code spans provide a more complete context for understanding how the `n_neighbors` parameter is handled and how the model is fitted.
