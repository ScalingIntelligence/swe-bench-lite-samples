The error trace indicates that a TypeError occurs when 'n_neighbors' is a float, suggesting that it should either be caught earlier or cast to an integer. The issue also mentions that even though the error is caught, a more helpful error message should be raised.\n\nFrom the file context, we can see that there are already identified relevant files and spans dealing with the initialization of the 'n_neighbors' parameter and its usage within the kneighbors method. These spans include initializations and checks during the fitting process and the execution of the kneighbors method.\n\nIn the new search results, there are additional spans of code that provide more context around the 'n_neighbors' parameter. These include the initialization of the parameter in the NeighborsBase class, the _check_algorithm_metric method which ensures the correctness of the algorithm and metric, and the _fit method which handles the fitting of the model. Also present are spans related to the kneighbors method in the KNeighborsMixin class, which is responsible for finding the nearest neighbors.\n\nGiven the additional context from the new search results, the identified spans appear to be relevant to the reported issue as they deal with the initialization, validation, and usage of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. These spans will help in addressing the issue by providing places where the parameter can be validated or type-casted to ensure compatibility and to enhance error handling with more informative messages.",
