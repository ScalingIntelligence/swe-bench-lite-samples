The current error is caught too late in the execution, leading to a less helpful error message. The task is to ensure that similar inputs, such as float values for 'n_neighbors', are either cast to integers or a more informative error message is provided before the operation proceeds. The provided search results include the 'kneighbors' method in the KNeighborsMixin class and the __init__ methods of NearestNeighbors and LSHForest classes. These code spans are relevant because they involve the handling of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Specifically, the 'kneighbors' method in KNeighborsMixin directly deals with the 'n_neighbors' parameter and could be the location where a type check and appropriate action should be integrated. Similarly, the __init__ method of the NearestNeighbors class also involves the 'n_neighbors' parameter setting, making it another relevant location for parameter validation. The LSHForest class, despite being deprecated, similarly handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter, showing a pattern and reinforcing the need for consistent validation across different implementations.",

The provided search results include multiple relevant sections of code in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py'.\n\nIn 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py', there are several spans that are relevant:\n- 'NeighborsBase.__init__' initializes the 'n_neighbors' parameter without checking its type.\n- 'NeighborsBase._check_algorithm_metric' checks the algorithm and metric but does not address the type of 'n_neighbors'.\n- 'NeighborsBase._fit' method fits the model but also does not check the type of 'n_neighbors'.\n- 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors' method is where the 'n_neighbors' is used, and it raises an error if 'n_neighbors' exceeds the number of samples.\n\nIn 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py', the 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' method initializes the NearestNeighbors class, setting 'n_neighbors' among other parameters. This is relevant as it is the entry point for setting 'n_neighbors'.\n\nThe identified spans are critical as they touch upon the initialization, fitting, and usage of 'n_neighbors'.
