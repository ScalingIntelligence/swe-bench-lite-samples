Additionally, the issue suggests that the `kneighbors` method should accept `n_neighbors` as a float and handle it appropriately.\n\nExamining the provided search results, the following key sections of code are identified as relevant:\n\n1. **NeighborsBase class initialization (`NeighborsBase.__init__`)**: This is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is initially defined and set. The current implementation does not check the type of `n_neighbors`.\n\n2. **NeighborsBase class's `_check_algorithm_metric` method**: This method could potentially be used to add a type check for `n_neighbors` before any computations begin.\n\n3. **KNeighborsMixin class's `kneighbors` method (`KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`)**: This method is used to find the nearest neighbors, and it should ideally handle the `n_neighbors` parameter appropriately if it is passed as a float.\n\n4. **NearestNeighbors class initialization (`NearestNeighbors.__init__`)**: This class inherits from NeighborsBase and provides a real implementation of neighbor search. This is also a critical place to ensure `n_neighbors` is handled correctly.\n\nThese sections of code are crucial as they directly involve the `n_neighbors` parameter and would need updates to include type validation and possibly type casting. The search appears complete as the identified sections cover the necessary areas to address the issue.",
