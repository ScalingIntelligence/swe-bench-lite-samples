The task is to ensure that parameter validation is added, and possibly to provide a more informative error message or handle the type casting internally.\n\nFrom the search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n1. In `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`, the `NearestNeighbors` class definition and its `__init__` method are found. This class inherits from `NeighborsBase` and other mixins, and it initializes with `n_neighbors`, which defaults to 5. This is where parameter validation for `n_neighbors` should be added to ensure it is an integer.\n2. In `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, the `KNeighborsMixin` class with its `kneighbors` method is relevant. This method is used to find the neighbors for each point in the data set X (or neighborhood excluding X if it is the training data). The method should also handle the `n_neighbors` parameter, and since it is called within `kneighbors`, it could be a suitable location to implement type checking or casting for `n_neighbors`.\n\nThese two files and their relevant methods are critical for addressing the issue as they directly deal with the `n_neighbors` parameter, its initialization, and usage. Additional validation or error handling should be implemented in these methods to resolve the issue.",

This results in a TypeError. The goal is to catch this error earlier and provide a more helpful error message or automatically cast the float to an integer. The provided search results include multiple files and spans, but the most relevant ones are in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`. Specifically, the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` method are critical as they define the `n_neighbors` parameter and could be where the validation logic should be added. Additionally, the `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method are relevant as they handle the `n_neighbors` parameter during neighbor search. These methods should be reviewed to ensure they handle the parameter correctly and provide meaningful error messages or automatic casting if necessary.",
