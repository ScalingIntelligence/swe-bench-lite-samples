Additionally, the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` method are responsible for the base initialization of this parameter across various neighbor estimators. Furthermore, the `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method are relevant as they handle the `kneighbors` functionality which is directly impacted by the `n_neighbors` parameter. These code spans provide a good starting point to identify where the validation for the `n_neighbors` parameter could be implemented or where a more informative error message could be raised.
