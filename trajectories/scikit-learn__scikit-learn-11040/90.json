The search results provide the relevant code within the 'KNeighborsMixin' class, specifically its 'kneighbors' method. This method is responsible for handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Analyzing the code, it's evident that the method does not currently perform any validation or type conversion on the 'n_neighbors' parameter before using it. It allows a float value to pass through, which eventually leads to a TypeError when attempting to use it as an index. This aligns with the reported issue. The solution should involve adding validation or type conversion to ensure that 'n_neighbors' is always an integer, and if it's a float, a helpful error message should be raised.
