The search results provided contain the 'kneighbors' method within the 'KNeighborsMixin' class in 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py'. This method directly relates to the functionality described in the issue, as it handles the 'n_neighbors' parameter. Specifically, the method checks if 'n_neighbors' is None and sets it to the class attribute 'n_neighbors'. However, it does not enforce the type of 'n_neighbors', which could lead to issues when a float is passed. This method is thus highly relevant for addressing the issue by potentially adding type checks or adjustments to accept and handle float input for 'n_neighbors' appropriately.",
