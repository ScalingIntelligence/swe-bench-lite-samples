Reviewed the reported issue: The issue pertains to missing parameter validation for the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the NearestNeighbors estimator, specifically when a float value is passed. The expected behavior is to either cast it to an integer or raise a more helpful error message.\n\n2. Analyzed the current file context: No relevant code has been identified yet in the provided context.\n\n3. Processed new search results:\n  a. Identified the relevant code spans in the 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' file, specifically within the 'NearestNeighbors' class and its '__init__' method, which handles the initialization of the 'n_neighbors' parameter.\n  b. Identified the relevant code spans in the 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' file, specifically within the 'KNeighborsMixin' class and its 'kneighbors' method, which could be relevant for handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter during the k-nearest neighbors search.\n\n4. Conclusion: The identified spans in the 'NearestNeighbors' and 'KNeighborsMixin' classes are directly relevant to the reported issue, as they involve handling the 'n_neighbors' parameter.
