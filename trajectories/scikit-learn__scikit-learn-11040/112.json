This should ideally be caught earlier, possibly in the '__init__' method of the NearestNeighbors or NeighborsBase class, and a more helpful error message should be raised. Additionally, there is a request for ensuring that 'neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)' should also work. The search results provide relevant code spans in the 'sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py' and 'sklearn/neighbors/base.py' files. The '__init__' method of the NearestNeighbors class initializes the 'n_neighbors' parameter, and the '_check_algorithm_metric' method in the NeighborsBase class currently does not validate or handle the case when 'n_neighbors' is a float. Therefore, implementing the validation logic in these methods should address the issue. The 'kneighbors' method in the KNeighborsMixin class also does not have specific checks for float types for 'n_neighbors' and might need adjustments to handle such cases gracefully.",
