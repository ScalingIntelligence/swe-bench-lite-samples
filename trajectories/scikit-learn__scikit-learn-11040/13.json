The current error is not informative and occurs later in the process. The issue suggests either catching the error earlier or casting the float to an integer. The provided file context and search results contain relevant code spans that need to be reviewed to identify where parameter validation can be added or improved for the `n_neighbors` parameter. The relevant files and spans to focus on are `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` and `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py`. In `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`, the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` method are defined, which initializes the `n_neighbors` parameter. Additionally, the `_check_algorithm_metric` method should be reviewed for potential checks on the `n_neighbors` parameter. The `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method should also be reviewed to ensure that the `n_neighbors` parameter is handled correctly when passed to the method directly. The `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` file defines the `NearestNeighbors` class, which inherits from `NeighborsBase` and `KNeighborsMixin`. The `NearestNeighbors` class needs to ensure that its `__init__` method initializes and checks the `n_neighbors` parameter correctly.\n\nSteps for identification:\n1. Review the `NeighborsBase.__init__` span in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` to identify if any checks are missing for the `n_neighbors` parameter when it is a float.\n2. Check if the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors` method in `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` correctly handles the `n_neighbors` parameter when passed to the method directly.\n3. Ensure that `NearestNeighbors.__init__` in `sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py` correctly initializes the `n_neighbors` parameter, possibly including additional checks if necessary.\n\nAfter reviewing these spans, it is evident that enhancements are needed in the parameter validation for `n_neighbors`, especially to handle float values more gracefully. The identified spans are crucial for implementing these changes.",
