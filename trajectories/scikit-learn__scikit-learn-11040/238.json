To address this, the following steps should be taken: 1. Validate the 'n_neighbors' parameter during initialization to ensure it is an integer. 2. Modify the 'kneighbors' method to handle float inputs for 'n_neighbors' gracefully, either by converting them to integers or by raising a helpful error message.
