The task is to improve parameter validation to either provide a more helpful error message or handle the conversion gracefully. The current search results do not include the specific validation checks for the 'n_neighbors' parameter; however, they do include relevant code from the 'KNeighborsMixin' class where the 'kneighbors' method is defined, suggesting that modifications here might address the issue. Additionally, there are other relevant parts of the codebase that revolve around handling and checking arrays, though these do not directly address the float to int issue. Further, in 'base.py', the 'kneighbors' method does not currently cast floats to int but immediately uses 'check_array', implying that additional validation or type handling before this point might be necessary.",
