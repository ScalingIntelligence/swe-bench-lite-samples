The issue specifically points out that a TypeError occurs when `n_neighbors` is a float, and suggests that this should be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. Additionally, the issue asks to ensure that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` also works.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided search results, we focus on the `NeighborsBase` class and its `__init__` method where `n_neighbors` is initialized. We also look at the `KNeighborsMixin` class and its `kneighbors` method, which is where the `n_neighbors` parameter is used in the context of finding nearest neighbors. The `NearestNeighbors` class, which inherits from `NeighborsBase` and `KNeighborsMixin`, also initializes `n_neighbors`. These are foundational parts of the scikit-learn's neighbors module that need to be adjusted to handle float `n_neighbors` appropriately.\n\nGiven the context, the identified spans 'NeighborsBase.__init__', 'KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors', and 'NearestNeighbors.__init__' are directly related to handling and using the `n_neighbors` parameter. These spans will need to be modified to either validate the type of `n_neighbors` during initialization or adjust how they process `n_neighbors` in the `kneighbors` method to handle float values by casting them to integers or raising an appropriate error.\n\nBased on the analysis, the provided code spans are relevant to addressing the issue, and no additional spans are needed from the search results to get a comprehensive view.",
