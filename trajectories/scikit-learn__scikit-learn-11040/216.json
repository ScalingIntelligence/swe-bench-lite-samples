Additionally, we should verify if similar checks are in place for other relevant parameters within the class or mixins.",

The error message suggests that the float value is causing a TypeError when interpreted as an integer. The task is to implement better error handling for this parameter or to allow it to be cast to an integer. To identify the relevant code spans, I will focus on the NearestNeighbors class and its associated methods, particularly the __init__ method for parameter setting and the kneighbors method where the parameter is used. I will also review the base class NeighborsBase for potential parameter validation checks. Examining the search results, I observe that the NearestNeighbors.__init__ and NeighborsBase.__init__ methods are present, which are relevant for initial parameter validation. The KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors method is also provided, which is crucial as it directly involves the use of the 'n_neighbors' parameter. These methods should contain the necessary code spans to address the issue.",

Additionally, the issue also requires ensuring that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` works properly by either raising a more informative error or converting the float to an integer.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided file context and search results, I have identified that the initialization of `NearestNeighbors` and `NeighborsBase` classes are relevant. These classes contain the parameters `n_neighbors` which are essential for the functionality that needs parameter validation. Additionally, the `kneighbors` method has been identified, which is directly related to the functionality where the float `n_neighbors` should be handled or raise an appropriate error.
