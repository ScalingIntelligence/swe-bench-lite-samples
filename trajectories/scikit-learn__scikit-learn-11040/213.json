But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about missing parameter validation for the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the Neighbors estimator, specifically when 'n_neighbors' is a float. The issue provides an example where the error is not caught early, leading to a less informative error message. The solution suggests either raising a more helpful error message or being lenient and casting the float to an integer. The provided context and search results focus on the 'NearestNeighbors' and its related methods. The current context includes the '__init__' method of 'NeighborsBase' and the 'kneighbors' method of 'KNeighborsMixin'. The search results extend this with the 'radius_neighbors' method of 'RadiusNeighborsMixin'. To address the issue, we need to ensure that the 'n_neighbors' parameter is checked for type 'int' in the '__init__' method of 'NeighborsBase' and possibly in the 'kneighbors' method of 'KNeighborsMixin' to handle the case where 'n_neighbors' might be provided as a float within the 'kneighbors' method itself. However, the provided search results do not directly address the type checking for 'n_neighbors'. It seems necessary to add this validation to ensure the reported issue is resolved adequately.",
