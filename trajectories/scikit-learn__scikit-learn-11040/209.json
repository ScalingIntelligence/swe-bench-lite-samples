Additionally, the KNeighborsMixin class contains the kneighbors method which is defined to use 'n_neighbors' but lacks specific type validation. This suggests that deeper in the implementation, probably within the tree structures or during the actual neighbor search, the float value leads to a TypeError. This error handling could be improved by adding explicit type checks within the NearestNeighbors class's initializer or within the kneighbors method in the KNeighborsMixin.

Additionally, the KNeighborsMixin class contains the kneighbors method which is defined to use 'n_neighbors' but lacks specific type validation. This suggests that deeper in the implementation, probably within the tree structures or during the actual neighbor search, the float value leads to a TypeError. This error handling could be improved by adding explicit type checks within the NearestNeighbors class's initializer or within the kneighbors method in the KNeighborsMixin.

This leads to a TypeError when the float value is interpreted as an integer. Additionally, the issue mentions that the error should be caught earlier with a more helpful error message. The current file context shows relevant parts in 'base.py' where the NeighborsBase class is defined with its __init__, _check_algorithm_metric, and _fit methods. Further, in 'unsupervised.py', the NearestNeighbors class is found, extending from NeighborsBase. The search results include 'validation.py' which has utility functions like check_array, check_X_y, and check_consistent_length that could be used to validate inputs.\n\nBased on the issue, the relevant code spans should include parts of 'base.py' and 'unsupervised.py' that deal with the initialization and fitting of the NearestNeighbors estimator, especially where the 'n_neighbors' parameter is handled. The 'validation.py' could provide utility functions to integrate into the 'n_neighbors' handling for better input validation. Considering the analysis, it is estimated that the relevant spans are those dealing with the 'n_neighbors' parameter and initialization/fitting methods.",

This specific validation does not currently exist in the provided context, indicating a clear area for improvement to prevent runtime errors when 'n_neighbors' is not an integer. While the utility module sklearn/utils/validation.py is not directly included in the context, it is likely that helper functions for parameter validation exist there and should be integrated to enhance the NearestNeighbors class.
