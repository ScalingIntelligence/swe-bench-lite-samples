The differences include the use of 'n_components' instead of 'n_clusters', the absence of storing 'labels_' of training data, and the lack of a 'fit_predict' method. To investigate if making mixture models more clusterer-like is feasible, focus on the classes and methods related to mixture models and clusterers. Specifically, look into the GaussianMixture, _GMMBase, and BaseMixture classes, and check if methods like 'fit_predict' can be incorporated without disrupting their current functionality. Also, examine the BaseMixture and ClusterMixin classes to understand the interface differences more clearly.",

This means MMs should align their API with that of clusterers, addressing key differences such as having an `n_clusters` parameter instead of `n_components`, storing `labels_`, and having a `fit_predict` method. In analyzing the search results: The `_GMMBase` class in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` has an `n_components` parameter which aligns well with the desire for clusterer compatibility by having a parameter similar to `n_clusters`. Additionally, the class includes a `fit_predict` method which is another key aspect for compatibility, making the existing method relevant. On the other hand, `sklearn/base.py` contains the `ClusterMixin` class, which features a `fit_predict` method and `labels_` attribute, demonstrating how these aspects should be incorporated into mixture models for full clusterer compatibility. Based on these findings, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they cover the necessary API changes towards making mixture models clusterer-compatible.",

Key points of the issue include having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, ensuring the MMs store `labels_`, and implementing a `fit_predict` method. Examination of the provided code spans reveals that `_GMMBase` class does indeed have an `n_components` parameter in its `__init__` method, akin to `n_clusters` but lacks the `labels_` attribute. Additionally, it has a partially implemented `fit_predict` method which differs from conventional clusterers. The search results also include `BayesianGaussianMixture` and `GaussianMixture` classes, both part of the Mixture Models, showcasing different implementations of initialization and handling of components and prediction. These findings strongly indicate relevant code spans that align with the reported issue's requirements for making MMs more clusterer-like. Therefore, the task is complete with identified relevant spans.",

Mixture models have an `n_components` parameter, analogous to `n_clusters` in clusterers.\n2. Mixture models do not store `labels_` of the training data.\n3. Mixture models lack a `fit_predict` method.\n\nGiven this context, I reviewed the provided file context and search results to identify relevant code spans that address these points. I focused on: \n\n- The presence of `n_components` or `n_clusters` parameter in the initialization of mixture models.\n- The absence of `labels_` in the state attributes of these models.\n- The implementation of the `fit_predict` method.\n\nFrom the search results, I identified several relevant code spans. Notably, both `BayesianGaussianMixture` and `GaussianMixture` models have an `__init__` method with an `n_components` parameter that parallels the `n_clusters` parameter in clusterers. These models do not store `labels_` in their attributes, aligning with the issue's concern. Additionally, the issue's lack of `fit_predict` method is clearly demonstrated by the absence of such a method in the provided code spans for these mixture models.\n\nFinally, I ensured that all relevant code spans are considered, not just isolated parts, to confirm their relevance to the reported issue. Based on this analysis, the provided search results sufficiently address the reported issue concerning the interface differences between mixture models and clusterers.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
