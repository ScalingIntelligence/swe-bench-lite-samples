Key points include the need for an 'n_components' parameter similar to 'n_clusters', lack of 'labels_' in training data, and absence of 'fit_predict' method in MMs. Relevant code spans in 'gaussian_mixture.py' show the GaussianMixture class with its 'n_components' parameter and several methods relevant to estimation and computation. In 'gmm.py', the _GMMBase class has 'n_clusters', 'labels_', and 'fit_predict' which are currently missing in MMs. The BayesianGaussianMixture in 'bayesian_mixture.py' also uses 'n_components'. This indicates that modifications or additions to these classes could bring MMs closer to the clusterers' interface, addressing the reported issue.

The key differences include the presence of an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`, omission of `labels_` storage, and lack of a `fit_predict` method. Analysis of the provided file context and search results reveals that the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes are essentially not dissimilar from clustering algorithms in behavior, notwithstanding their probabilistic nature and differences in method names. Nevertheless, they can be considered as sitting in a blurred line between typical clustering approaches and traditional Gaussian mixture models. To achieve more uniform API compatibility with standard clusterers, the `GaussianMixture` class should ideally incorporate a `fit_predict` method and possibly offer direct access to assigned `labels_` after fitting. Moreover, the `_GMMBase` class already demonstrates a similar approach with a `fit_predict` method but should still conform to the mixture model layout proposed. The search results show that the classes in `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` and `sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py` do not currently have methods directly mirroring the standard clusterer interface, presenting an opportunity to adjust the classes to this interface.",
