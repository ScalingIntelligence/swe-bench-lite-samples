The analysis of the search results indicates that both `VBGMM` and `GaussianMixture` classes from `sklearn/mixture` directly relate to the probabilistic aspect of mixture models, especially with parameters like `n_components` (which corresponds to `n_clusters` in clusterers). The absence of `labels_` in training data and the missing `fit_predict` method is evident in these classes, which align with the issues stated. The `BayesianGaussianMixture` class also shows similar characteristics and differences from standard clusterers, particularly in its methods and parameters. Considering these, the identified code spans provide a strong basis for understanding and potentially adapting the MM classes to have a more clusterer-compatible interface, as suggested by the issue. However, it's noted that while these classes offer insights, the complete solution might also necessitate adaptations in other parts of the codebase, such as the general clusterer interface in `sklearn.cluster`.",
