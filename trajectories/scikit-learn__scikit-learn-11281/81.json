The search results reveal several relevant classes and methods within `sklearn/mixture/`, which are likely part of the implementation of mixture models in the codebase. Specifically, the `_GMMBase`, `GaussianMixture`, `_DPGMMBase`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes all appear to implement key functionalities related to mixture models, such as parameter initialization, fitting, and prediction. Notably, the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes do not currently implement a `fit_predict` method, which is one of the differences highlighted in the issue. These classes also have methods for initializing and manipulating parameters relevant to the model, such as `n_components` and various covariance types. The results suggest that modifying these classes to include `fit_predict` and store `labels_` could align their API more closely with traditional clusterers, as proposed in the issue.",
