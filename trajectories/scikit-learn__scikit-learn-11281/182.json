Evaluating the provided code spans, we find that both 'GaussianMixture' and 'DPGMM' classes have an 'n_components' parameter, which is directly related to the number of clusters. However, neither store 'labels_' in their training data, nor do they have a 'fit_predict' method. The 'BaseMixture' class in 'base.py' also includes 'n_components' among its parameters but does not implement 'fit_predict'. The '_GMMBase' class in 'gmm.py' does implement 'fit_predict', making it relevant for comparison or as potential source code for implementing this method in MMs. Therefore, the identified code spans might help in understanding where changes could be made or additional features added to make MMs more compatible with clusterers.",

Key points from the issue include the presence of an `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), the absence of a `labels_` attribute in the training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MM classes. Reviewing the provided search results and context, the most relevant piece is the `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py`, which notably includes both the `__init__` method with an `n_components` parameter mirroring the `n_clusters` parameter in typical clusterers, and a `fit_predict` method. This class serves as a good basis for understanding the changes needed to make MMs more clusterer-like. However, the context does not show any attributes that store `labels_`, suggesting that this would be a new addition if MMs were to be made more consistent with clusterers. Since the `GaussianMixture`, `BaseMixture`, and `DPGMM` classes in the context do not have a `fit_predict` method, this highlights the specific aspect that would need adaptation or addition across these classes to align them with clusterer APIs. Additionally, the `_GMMBase` class from the search results, despite not being a part of the previous context, further emphasizes the need for the `fit_predict` method in the classes like `GaussianMixture` to bridge the API gap. Therefore, focusing on adding these missing components could significantly enhance the consistency with clusterers.",

Key points include having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_`, and having a `fit_predict` method. After analyzing the provided code context and search results, I identified several relevant files and code spans. In `gaussian_mixture.py`, the `GaussianMixture` class has the `n_components` parameter and its initialization. In `dpgmm.py`, the deprecated `DPGMM` class is also relevant because it likely influenced past designs. In `base.py`, the `BaseMixture` class sets many of the shared parameters among mixture models. Lastly, in `gmm.py`, `_GMMBase` class includes a `fit_predict` method that could potentially be integrated into the mixture models. These selections align with the requirements to make mixture models more clusterer-like.",
