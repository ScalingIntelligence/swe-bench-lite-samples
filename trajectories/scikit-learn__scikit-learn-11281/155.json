Introduce an `n_clusters` parameter as an alias for `n_components`. 2. Store the `labels_` attribute for training data. 3. Implement a `fit_predict` method. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the mixture models' base classes and methods, which can be leveraged to implement these changes. By examining the `_GMMBase` class, we can identify that the `n_components` parameter is already present but could be extended to include `n_clusters`. Additionally, the `labels_` attribute is not stored, and the `fit_predict` method is absent. The `fit`, `predict`, and `predict_proba` methods are present and can potentially be adapted to support the new requirements. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant for addressing the issue.",

Key points include the presence of an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`, absence of `labels_` in MM training data, and the absence of `fit_predict` method in MMs. The analysis involved checking the codebase to find relevant code spans discussing these differences.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, several key pieces of code are identified as relevant. These include the `_GMMBase` and `_DPGMMBase` classes which contain the `n_components` parameter in their initialization methods (`__init__`). Additionally, the `_GMMBase.fit_predict` method is seen as an attempt to introduce the missing `fit_predict` functionality, though it doesn't store `labels_` as seen in the `ClusterMixin` class's `fit_predict` method.\n\nFurther investigation in the search results confirms the presence of these elements mentioned in the issue across multiple files such as `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, `sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py`, and `sklearn/mixture/base.py`. These files contain the core implementation of GMMs where changes could be made to align the API more closely with that of clusterers.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the relevant code spans from the search results are extracted to highlight the parts that address the concerns outlined in the issue. This includes the initialization method where `n_components` is defined, and the `fit_predict` method in both `_GMMBase` and `_DPGMMBase` classes as well as in the `ClusterMixin` class.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
