The search results provided include classes like `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` from `gaussian_mixture.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py`, respectively, which have an `n_components` parameter, aligning with the issue's point about MMs. Additionally, the `BaseMixture` class in `base.py` also includes this parameter, indicating a base implementation for these models. The `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` includes a `fit_predict` method, which is currently missing in the mixture models but is crucial for aligning with clusterers. Therefore, the relevant code spans relate to the `n_components` parameter in the mixture models and the missing `fit_predict` method.",

Key differences include the presence of `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`, absence of `labels_`, and lack of `fit_predict` method. Given the search results, several relevant code spans can be identified across the GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture classes: Initialization (`__init__`), parameter checking (`_check_parameters`, `_check_weights_parameters`), and methods relevant to transformation and prediction (`_estimate_log_prob`, `_estimate_log_weights`, `_get_parameters`, `_set_parameters`). These methods are crucial for understanding the internal workings of the current implementation and may need adaptations to align with the clusterer interface. For instance, it might be necessary to add a `fit_predict` method and manage `labels_` attribute to these classes.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers.
