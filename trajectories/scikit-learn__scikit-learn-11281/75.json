The primary focus is on features like the presence of `n_components` versus `n_clusters`, the absence of `labels_` in MMs, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MMs. The search results reveal the existence of a `GaussianMixture` class in 'sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py' which includes an `n_components` parameter similar to the described issue, but lacks a `fit_predict` method and storage of `labels_`. Additionally, there's a `_GMMBase` class in 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py' that includes a `fit_predict` method but lacks `labels_`. The 'BayesianGaussianMixture' in 'sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py' and the 'BaseMixture' class in 'sklearn/mixture/base.py' also align with the issue as they handle parameters and methods that could potentially be modified to include `labels_` and `fit_predict` methods. The task is to identify these key areas in the code where the API differences can be addressed to make MMs more clusterer-compatible.",
