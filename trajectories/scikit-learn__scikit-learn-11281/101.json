Specifically, it mentions three differences: the presence of an 'n_components' parameter, the absence of a 'labels_' attribute, and the lack of a 'fit_predict' method in mixture models. To address this, we should search for classes related to mixture models and identify where these specific differences occur. We should also look for any base classes or mixins that might be relevant to both mixture models and clusterers.",

The search results provide two key files: `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` and `sklearn/base.py`, which contain the `_GMMBase` class and the `ClusterMixin` class, respectively. The `_GMMBase` class includes the `n_components` parameter and a method `fit_predict`, which aligns with the issue's discussion about MM's API differences. This code span is highly relevant as it directly addresses the issue's concerns about MM's current functionalities and their divergence from typical clusterer interfaces.",
