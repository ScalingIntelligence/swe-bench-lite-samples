The key differences highlighted include the lack of `labels_`, absence of `fit_predict` method, and the use of `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`. To address this issue, it is necessary to search for the classes and methods related to Mixture Models and evaluate their interfaces against those of clusterers. The focus should be on files related to mixture models and their base classes.",

Key points include the absence of `labels_` storage and `fit_predict` method in mixture models, even though they have an `n_components` parameter analogous to `n_clusters`. The provided search results encompass the base classes and methods for mixture models and clusterers, which align with the issue's concerns. Specifically, the `BaseMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` defines common attributes like `n_components` and methods such as `fit` and `predict`, but lacks the `fit_predict` method and storage for `labels_`. In contrast, the `_GMMBase` class in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` includes the `fit_predict` method, suggesting it is more aligned with the clusterer interface. The `ClusterMixin` class in `sklearn/base.py` explicitly defines the `fit_predict` method, which is a standard for clusterers. These code spans suggest that restructuring mixture models to more closely resemble clusterers could involve incorporating the `fit_predict` method and ensuring storage of `labels_`. This involves altering the `BaseMixture` class and possibly extending the `ClusterMixin` to include mixture models. The relevance of these code spans to the issue is clear as they illustrate where changes would need to be made to align mixture models with the clusterer interface.",

The key points of the issue are the presence of `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`, absence of `labels_` storage, and lack of `fit_predict` method. In the provided context and search results, we have several relevant code spans detailing the `BaseMixture` class, the `_GMMBase` class, and other mixture model classes such as `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`. These classes currently do not include `labels_` in their attributes and lack the `fit_predict` method, which are central to the issue. Analyzing the new search results, we find that `BaseMixture` still does not have `labels_` stored in it, and although `_GMMBase` has a `fit_predict` method, it's not implemented in a way that stores the cluster labels within the instance for later access. The search results also reveal new functionalities like `_initialize_parameters` in `BaseMixture` that could be relevant if we were to implement modifications to make MMs more clusterer-like. However, none of the current code spans directly address the storage of `labels_` or the addition of a `fit_predict` method with the capability to store these labels. Therefore, the search task is not yet complete based on the initial assessment.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
