We need to find files and code snippets that would help us understand the current implementation and what needs to be changed, such as the addition of `fit_predict` method, and adjusting the handling of parameters like `n_components` for consistency. Reading through the files we have, especially those in sklearn/mixture/, will be crucial to identify where modifications are necessary for the mixture models to better align with clusterers.",

The key points noted are the presence of an `n_components` parameter that serves a similar purpose to `n_clusters`, the absence of a `labels_` attribute in training data storage, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MMs. Currently, MMs are documented and treated separately, which suggests a need for unification. Examining the search results, several key files (`gmm.py`, `gaussian_mixture.py`, `base.py`, and `dpgmm.py`) and their respective code spans are found to be directly related to these concerns. These files contain definitions of classes and methods that are pivotal for MMs, such as `_GMMBase`, `GaussianMixture`, `BaseMixture`, and `_DPGMMBase`. Significant methods like `__init__` with `n_components`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, and others that could potentially be adapted to include missing functionalities such as storing labels and implementing `fit_predict` are identified. This analysis suggests that the identified code spans in these files are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue, indicating that efforts should focus on modifying these interfaces to more closely align with those of clusterers.",
