There are several differences pointed out, such as the absence of a `labels_` attribute and the `fit_predict` method in mixture models compared to traditional clusterers. The main classes to focus on are `GaussianMixture` and `_GMMBase`. Additionally, the presence of the `ClusterMixin` class in `sklearn/base.py` suggests that implementing `fit_predict` might be a significant change to consider. It is important to review these classes and the `BaseMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` to understand the current state and identify potential areas for alignment with clusterers.",

Although the names are different, their role is equivalent.\n2. **Training Data Labels**: MMs currently do not store the `labels_` attribute which is common in clusterers. This could be a point of divergence.\n3. **Method Availability**: MMs do not have a `fit_predict` method, which is standard in clusterers. Adding this method would align the APIs better.\n4. **Documentation**: MMs are documented separately, which might lead to confusion or inefficiencies in understanding and using these models.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans in the search results:\n- The `_GMMBase` class in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` already has a `fit_predict` method (`span id='_GMMBase.fit_predict'`), which is a positive sign towards aligning with clusterers.\n- The `GaussianMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` and the `BaseMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` provide foundational elements for mixture modeling but lack specific interface features like `labels_` storage and more unified documentation.\n\nConsidering these points, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue primarily revolve around the classes already mentioned, focusing on enhancing their interface towards a more clusterer-like API, particularly by adding missing methods and ensuring comprehensive documentation.",

Specifically, the issue notes that MMs have an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`, do not store `labels_`, and lack a `fit_predict` method. Furthermore, MMs are documented separately. The search results contain a relevant span in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` that defines the `fit_predict` method for the `_GMMBase` class, demonstrating that at least part of the functionality to make MMs more clusterer-like is already implemented but not consistently across all mixture model implementations. Given these differences and the existing partial implementation in `_GMMBase`, it is reasonable to consider further aligning MMs with clusterers to enhance consistency and usability.",

Additionally, while `BaseMixture` and `GaussianMixture` do not explicitly mention `labels_`, the framework within `BaseMixture` could potentially support the addition of such an attribute. The `ClusterMixin` class in `sklearn/base.py` does indicate that implementing `fit_predict` should return `self.labels_`, which currently seems to be missing in the mixture models. Therefore, the next steps involve identifying where and how the `labels_` attribute can be introduced in `_GMMBase`, `GMM`, or `GaussianMixture` to align them more closely with clusterers, and ensuring that the `fit_predict` method is properly implemented in alignment with clusterer functionalities, possibly by following the pattern established in `ClusterMixin`.",
