These classes include the `n_components` parameter and, notably, `_GMMBase` has a `fit_predict` method. While `labels_` attribute is not directly mentioned, reviewing these classes and methods can help identify where such an attribute might be added or changed to align with clusterer APIs.

I examined the code spans in the search results to see if these characteristics are present or can be implemented. The relevant code spans identified are the initialization of the Mixture Models classes which include the `n_components` parameter, and the `fit_predict` method implementations.
