Across the provided code spans, I found instances of the `n_components` parameter in the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes, both located in the `gaussian_mixture.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py` files respectively. However, neither class demonstrated a `fit_predict` method or storage for `labels_`. These findings are directly related to the dissimilarities between mixture models and typical clusterers as outlined in the issue. Thus, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the issue's concern about making mixture models more clusterer-like.",

The `_GMMBase` class, however, does have a `fit_predict` method, which is a strong candidate for making mixture models more cluster-like.

Notable findings include the inheritance from BaseMixture indicating shared functionality. The `_GMMBase` class already includes a `fit_predict` method which could serve as a model for adding such functionality to the more modern Mixture Model classes. The search results largely confirm the structure and methods found in the file context, emphasizing the need for structured integration rather than isolated code changes.

The 'fit_predict' method implementation from the GMM class could serve as a template for adding this functionality to the current implementations.
