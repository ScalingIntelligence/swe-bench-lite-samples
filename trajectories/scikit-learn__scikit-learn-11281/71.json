The search results provide several relevant code spans in the `sklearn.mixture` module, particularly in `base.py`, `gaussian_mixture.py`, and `bayesian_mixture.py`. These files contain the core classes and methods for mixture models such as `BaseMixture`, `GaussianMixture`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture`, which currently do not store `labels_` or have a `fit_predict` method. To align with the suggested changes, modifications would need to be made to these classes to include these missing functionalities. Additionally, the search results include `ClusterMixin` in `sklearn/base.py`, which provides the `fit_predict` method that could be integrated into the mixture models.",

The current file context already provides relevant files and spans in 'sklearn/mixture/base.py', 'sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py', and 'sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py'. The new search results confirm the existence of these files and provide additional context on how mixture models are initialized and used. Notably, the GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture classes inherit from BaseMixture, which initializes the 'n_components' parameter similar to 'n_clusters' in clusterers. There is, however, no mention of 'labels_', indicating they are not stored, and no 'fit_predict' method. These observations suggest that the mixture models indeed differ from traditional clusterers in their interface, backing the issue's description. To potentially align these models with the clusterer interface, one could consider adding 'labels_' storage and implementing 'fit_predict'. This would likely require modifications across classes like GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture and possibly their base class, BaseMixture.",
