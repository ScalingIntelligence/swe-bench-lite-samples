Key differences include the `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), the absence of `labels_` in training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. To address this, we should search for the implementation of these mixture models and potentially the base classes they inherit from to identify where adjustments can be made.",

Specifically, it notes that MMs have an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, do not store `labels_`, and lack a `fit_predict` method. The task is to evaluate whether MMs should be made more like clusterers. The search results include several classes (_GMMBase, BaseMixture, GaussianMixture, BayesianGaussianMixture) which implement MM functionalities. These classes contain methods such as `__init__`, `score_samples`, `score`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, and `_fit`. Notably, `_GMMBase` and `GaussianMixture` have `fit_predict` methods, which align with the clusterer interface. These methods are relevant as they indicate the current state of the MM implementation and serve as a base for determining the modifications necessary to align MMs more closely with the clusterer interface. The `BaseMixture` class, which is inherited by `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`, provides a foundational structure for MMs, including shared methods and attributes. The `ClusterMixin` class provides a `fit_predict` method, which is a key component missing in the MM interface as per the issue. This method is essential for making MMs more clusterer-compatible. Therefore, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding the current MM implementation and for planning any modifications to make MMs more like clusterers.",
