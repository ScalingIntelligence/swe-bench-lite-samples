The presence of an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`.\n2. The absence of `labels_` storage for training data.\n3. The lack of a `fit_predict` method.\n4. Separation in documentation.\n\nThe search results reveal code that could be relevant to resolving these disparities. The classes `_GMMBase`, `GMM`, `BaseMixture`, `GaussianMixture`, `DPGMM`, `VBGMM`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture` were encountered, which either directly or through inheritance, address aspects of mixture modeling. \n\nNotably, `_GMMBase` and its deprecated version `GMM` implement methods like `predict`, `fit_predict`, and `fit`, which are typically seen in clusterers. This indicates that the codebase already has some elements that could form the basis for making mixture models more clusterer-like. Additionally, distinct implementations such as `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` extend `BaseMixture`, suggesting customization options for different types of mixture modeling.\n\nThis preliminary analysis suggests that the current codebase has the necessary infrastructure to begin aligning mixture models more closely with clusterers by potentially introducing additional properties or methods where they are currently missing. Further detailed inspection and possibly code refactoring would be needed to fully align the functionality and API as per the reported issue.",
