The MMs currently differ in several ways: they use `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`, do not store `labels_`, and lack a `fit_predict` method. Given these differences, I will focus my search on the `sklearn.mixture` package, looking specifically for classes related to mixture models and checking if they implement methods typical of clusterers, such as `fit_predict` and storing `labels_`. This will help identify whether the existing implementations support or need adjustments to align with a clusterer-compatible interface.",

The current context and search results show that both `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes in the `gaussian_mixture.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py` files respectively, use an `n_components` parameter, which aligns with the issue's point about `n_clusters`. These classes do not appear to store `labels_` or implement `fit_predict` methods, confirming the other stated differences.

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
