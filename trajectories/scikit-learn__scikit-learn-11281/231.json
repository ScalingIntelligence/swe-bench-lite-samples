Key points are: 1) MM should have `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, 2) MM should store `labels_` of training data, 3) MM should have a `fit_predict` method. The search results show relevant files such as `gmm.py`, `dpgmm.py`, `bayesian_mixture.py`, `gaussian_mixture.py`, and `base.py`. These files contain classes like `_GMMBase`, `_DPGMMBase`, `BayesianGaussianMixture`, `GaussianMixture`, and `BaseMixture`. Relevant methods include `__init__` with `n_components`, `score_samples`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, `sample`, `fit_predict`, `fit`, and `_fit`. However, missing from the current implementation is the storage of `labels_` in the training data and ensuring `fit_predict` is appropriately implemented across all relevant classes. Given the provided search results, the identified spans cover most of the relevant code but do not address the storage of `labels_` directly.",
