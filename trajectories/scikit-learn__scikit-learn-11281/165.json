Mixture models have parameters and methods that suggest they could align more closely with the clusterer interface. Notably, they lack certain methods like `fit_predict` and do not store `labels_` after training. To address the issue, we should search for classes implementing mixture models, focusing on their methods and parameters to understand how they currently differ from clusterers.",

Key points include the presence of an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, the absence of `labels_` in training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. The search results contain relevant classes and methods within the sklearn.mixture package that could be modified to align with clusterer interfaces. Notably, `_GMMBase` and `GaussianMixture` classes have parameters and methods that could be adapted to better match clusterer interfaces, such as adding a `fit_predict` method and potentially storing training data `labels_`. Additionally, the `BaseMixture` class provides a foundational structure that other mixture models inherit from, suggesting modifications here could propagate changes consistently across all mixture models.",
