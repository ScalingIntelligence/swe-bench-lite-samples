The main points of contrast include the `n_components` vs `n_clusters` parameter, the absence of `labels_` in MMs, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MMs. The search results provide relevant code spans in `gaussian_mixture.py`, `base.py`, and `gmm.py`. These spans include the `init` methods from the `GaussianMixture` and `BaseMixture` classes, which involve the `n_components` parameter. Additionally, the `gmm.py` file contains a `fit_predict` method in the `_GMMBase` class. This method could be a starting point for implementing similar functionality in the mixture models. Overall, these code spans are relevant to addressing the issue by making the MMs more like clusterers.",

Key points mentioned are the addition of an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_` for training data, and implementing a `fit_predict` method. The search results provide insights into how these features are implemented in existing clusterers like KMeans and DBSCAN, as well as the current state of the mixture models, specifically GaussianMixture and its base class BaseMixture. The analysis shows that BaseMixture is more abstract and does not currently implement `fit_predict`, while GaussianMixture has more concrete implementations but also lacks `fit_predict`. These observations suggest that the relevant code spans would be those related to initializing and setting parameters like `n_components`, as well as methods that could be adapted or introduced to support cluster-like functionality in the mixture models.",

This suggests that aligning `GaussianMixture` with clusterer standards would involve integrating this method.

Key points include having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, absence of `labels_` attribute, and lack of a `fit_predict` method. We analyzed the existing code and reviewed new search results to identify relevant code spans.\n\nThe results showed relevant classes and methods, particularly `GaussianMixture` and `BaseMixture`, which represent the current mixture models. These classes lack `fit_predict` methods and do not store `labels_`.\n\nThe search results provided the `fit_predict` method for `_GMMBase`, which can be a model for adapting mixture models to have a clusterer-like interface. Similarly, the `fit` method and `score` method implementations in `KMeans` and `_GMMBase` classes respectively can serve as references for extending mixture models.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans within `gaussian_mixture.py` and `gmm.py` will be useful in addressing the issue, especially those related to initialization, fitting, and prediction methods which are crucial for compatibility with clusterer interfaces.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
