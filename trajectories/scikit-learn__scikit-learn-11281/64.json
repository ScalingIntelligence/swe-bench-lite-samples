Key points are the lack of 'labels_', the peculiar use of 'n_components' instead of 'n_clusters', and the absence of a 'fit_predict' method. Analyzing the given search results, several critical components are identified that are related to the points mentioned in the issue. In 'gaussian_mixture.py', the 'GaussianMixture' class inherits from 'BaseMixture' and includes an 'n_components' parameter in its '__init__' method, mirroring the issue's concern about model components. Additionally, the 'BaseMixture' class in 'base.py' also includes 'n_components' in its '__init__' method, indicating it might be a base for clusterer-like models. In 'gmm.py', the 'GMM' class has a deprecated 'fit_predict' method, addressing the missing functionality in the current MMs. However, the class 'GaussianMixture' lacks this method. Thus, the identified code spans exemplify the necessary aspects to align MMs more closely with traditional clusterers, suggesting potential areas for integration or modification in the API. Notably, the absence of 'labels_' and 'fit_predict' functionality in 'GaussianMixture' presents clear opportunities for enhancement.",
