The main points of divergence include the `n_components` parameter, the absence of `labels_`, and the lack of `fit_predict` method. Upon analyzing the provided search results, it's evident that the code spans in `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`, and `sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py` focus primarily on the initialization and functionality of the mixture models. These files contain the core implementation of how mixture models are defined and operate. Specifically, the `BaseMixture` class in `base.py` sets up the initial parameters including `n_components`, while `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` extend this class, further defining their respective behaviors. These findings suggest that modifications to align mixture models more closely with clusterers should focus on adding or modifying methods in these classes, possibly including the addition of a `fit_predict` method and ensuring `labels_` are stored after training. The current code structure provides a foundation upon which these changes can be implemented.",

Key differences mentioned include the `n_components` parameter in MMs which has an identical purpose to `n_clusters` in clusterers, the absence of `labels_` storage in MMs, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MMs. The search results reveal several relevant files and methods, particularly in the 'sklearn/cluster/' directory, where typical clusterers are defined. A comparison between MMs and typical clusterers shows that clusterers, such as KMeans, do include `fit_predict` methods and store `labels_`. Therefore, these similarities in clusterers could serve as templates for adapting MMs to have a more clusterer-like interface. Analyzing and adopting these methods directly or as templates is crucial for making the proposed changes to MMs. The search task seems complete as the necessary code spans providing examples of clusterers with `fit_predict` methods and `labels_` storage have been identified.",

Specifically, MMs lack certain features such as storing `labels_` and having a `fit_predict` method, which are present in other clusterers like KMeans. Analyzing the search results, it's clear that the BaseMixture class in sklearn/mixture/base.py is central to all mixture models, such as GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture. This class contains methods like `fit`, `predict`, and `_check_is_fitted`, but lacks `fit_predict` and storage of `labels_`. The focus should be on this class, as modifying it will affect all derived mixture models. Additionally, examining the KMeans class in sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py provides a useful comparison, showing how `fit_predict` is implemented. Based on this analysis, the initial focus should be on the `BaseMixture` class to align it with clusterer standards.",
