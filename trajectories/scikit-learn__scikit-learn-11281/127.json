Specifically, it mentions three key differences: the `n_components` parameter, the absence of `labels_`, and the lack of `fit_predict` method. The search results reveal the relevant code spans in the `gaussian_mixture.py`, `gmm.py`, and `base.py` files. These files contain classes such as `GaussianMixture`, `_GMMBase`, and `BaseMixture`, which define the methods and parameters that are currently different from the clusterers. Relevant code spans include the definitions of `n_components`, the methods for parameter checking and estimation, and the absence of `fit_predict` method in `GaussianMixture`. This analysis suggests these code spans are relevant for addressing the issue of making MMs more clusterer-compatible, particularly in aligning their parameters and methods with those of clusterers.",
