The relevant files identified so far include classes like GMM, GaussianMixture, DPGMM, and VBGMM. These classes should be inspected for differences in parameters, methods, and attributes compared to clusterers. The goal is to identify the necessary changes to make mixture models more consistent with clusterers. Notable differences include the absence of a `labels_` attribute, lack of `fit_predict` method, and the naming of the `n_components` parameter as opposed to `n_clusters` in clusterers. The search should focus on these specific differences and assess whether aligning them with clusterers is feasible and beneficial.",

The search results provide relevant code snippets in the `sklearn/mixture` directory.
