            "scratch_pad": "The issue suggests that mixture models in the sklearn library should have a clusterer-compatible interface. This involves aligning their API with the typical clustering models, which includes having an `n_components` parameter corresponding to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_` for training data, and having a `fit_predict` method. Currently, mixture models differ in these aspects. The goal is to identify all relevant mixture model classes in the sklearn library and their methods to evaluate if adjusting their API can align them better with clustering models.",

Key points include the presence of `n_components` (similar to `n_clusters`), the absence of `labels_` in training data storage, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. The search results show relevant classes like `_GMMBase`, `GMM`, `GaussianMixture`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture`. These classes contain methods such as `__init__`, `score_samples`, `score`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, `sample`, `fit_predict`, `_fit`, `fit`, and `_do_mstep`, among others. Notably, `GMM` and `GaussianMixture` classes have `n_components` as a parameter, which aligns with the issue's focus on making MMs more clusterer-like. The presence of `fit` and `predict` methods also supports the goal of interface similarity. The identified spans are relevant to understanding and potentially modifying the API of mixture models to better align with clusterer standards.",
