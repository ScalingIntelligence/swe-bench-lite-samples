Mixture models, despite being similar to clusterers, have notable API differences such as the absence of 'labels_' and 'fit_predict' method, and a different parameter 'n_components' instead of 'n_clusters'. Given the provided context, we should focus on the mixture model classes and potentially a base class if they exist. We should search for these classes to understand their current state and assess the feasibility of aligning their API with clusterer-like interfaces. Specific classes to look for include GaussianMixture, GMM, _GMMBase, and potentially BaseMixture if it serves as a base class for mixture models. Additionally, look for any mention of 'n_components', 'labels_', and 'fit_predict' to determine the extent of changes needed.",
