Specifically, it mentions that MM have an `n_components` parameter, lack a `labels_` attribute, and do not have a `fit_predict` method, unlike clusterers. The search results include code related to GaussianMixture and its base class, GMM, which is deprecated. Notably, GMM has a `fit_predict` method, which is absent in GaussianMixture. This discrepancy directly relates to the issue discussed. The analysis shows that while both classes have an `n_components` parameter, the modern GaussianMixture could be adaptively made more clusterer-like by implementing a `fit_predict` method and potentially storing `labels_` if needed. This would align it more closely with traditional clusterers. The relevance of these code spans to the issue is clear: 1) `GaussianMixture` for understanding the current state and potential changes needed to make it more clusterer-like. 2) `GMM` for referencing an older implementation with the `fit_predict` method that could be adapted for the newer GaussianMixture.",

Key points include having an `n_components` parameter as in `n_clusters`, not storing `labels_`, and lacking a `fit_predict` method. The provided file context and search results include relevant code spans: `_check_weights`, `_check_means`, `_check_precisions` in `gaussian_mixture.py`, and `__init__` methods in `GaussianMixture` class in both `gaussian_mixture.py` and `gmm.py`. The newer `GaussianMixture` class lacks the `fit_predict` method present in the deprecated `GMM` class from `gmm.py`. To make MMs more clusterer-like, it seems important to consider implementing the `fit_predict` method in the `GaussianMixture` class and ensuring the `n_components` parameter is consistently used. Also, checking existing methods for label storage or generation and aligning those with clusterer behavior is crucial. The search results confirm the presence of the `fit_predict` method in `_GMMBase` and `GMM`, which can be a guide for implementing this in the newer `GaussianMixture` class.",
