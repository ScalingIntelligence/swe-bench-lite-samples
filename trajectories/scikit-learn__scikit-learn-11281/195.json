Identify the key requirements mentioned in the reported issue: 'n_components' parameter, no 'labels_' storage, and no 'fit_predict' method.\n2. Compare these requirements with the provided code spans in the search results.\n3. Look for code sections that address or could be modified to address these requirements.\n\nThe search results include several classes that implement mixture models (GaussianMixture, BayesianGaussianMixture, _GMMBase, GMM, VBGMM). These classes use an 'n_components' parameter consistently, which matches the reported issue's mention of having an identical purpose to 'n_clusters'. Also notably, none of the classes store 'labels_', which aligns with the second point.\n\nThe classes _GMMBase and GMM include a 'fit_predict' method, which is absent in other classes. This suggests that the 'fit_predict' method might be a focus for aligning the mixture models API with clusterers, as it is present in clusterer APIs.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant files and spans are:\n- sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py for its implementation of GaussianMixture without a 'fit_predict' method.\n- sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py for providing a similar implementation in BayesianGaussianMixture.\n- sklearn/mixture/gmm.py for showing an example with a 'fit_predict' method that could potentially be added to other mixture models.\n\nThese selections are based on how closely the code spans address the specific points raised in the reported issue about the mixture models API.",

Notably, MMs lack a `labels_` attribute and a `fit_predict` method, which are standard in clusterers. The search results provide a detailed look into the `BaseMixture` class and its methods, which could potentially house the changes to align MMs more closely with clusterers. Key methods identified include `fit`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, and `score_samples` among others. These methods could be adapted to include the missing functionalities such as storing `labels_` and implementing a `fit_predict` method. The `BaseMixture` class also includes abstract methods that would need to be concretely defined in subclasses like `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`, which are already referenced in the file context. This comprehensive review sets the stage for making MMs more clusterer-compatible by implementing the identified changes in the relevant methods and classes.",

I examined the code spans in the provided search results, focusing on the `BaseMixture`, `GaussianMixture`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes. I looked for parameters similar to `n_clusters`, methods for storing labels (`labels_`), and the absence of `fit_predict`. I also considered the presence of abstract methods that might indicate the need for implementation adjustments to align with clusterer-like behavior. Based on this analysis, I identified the relevant spans in the `BaseMixture` and `GaussianMixture` classes, which include `__init__`, `fit`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, and other method signatures that need to be adapted or implemented to closer resemble clusterer API features.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
