The absence of a `fit_predict` method.\n\nThe search results reveal implementations of GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture classes which are part of the mixture models discussed. These classes indeed include an `n_components` parameter rather than `n_clusters`. They also lack a `labels_` attribute to store the labels of the training data. Furthermore, these classes do not implement a `fit_predict` method.\n\nOn the other hand, the GMM class (marked as deprecated) does implement the `fit_predict` method, which could be a useful reference if considering making the mixture models more like clusterers. Additionally, the DPGMM and VBGMM classes, also deprecated, might provide insights into potentially problematic implementations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans include the initialization of `n_components` in both GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture, and the method implementations in the deprecated GMM class that could serve as a guide for potentially needed changes, such as adding a `fit_predict` method.",

In examining the search results, the BaseMixture class does not have a `fit_predict` method, while the _GMMBase class in gmm.py does. This suggests a likely addition based on the interface discrepancy mentioned in the issue. Also, the current mixture models don't store `labels_` directly; however, they do predict labels using `predict` or `predict_proba` methods from BaseMixture, but these predictions aren't stored during the fitting process. The issue highlights the need for the mixture models to be more in line with clusterers in API design, including the suggested modifications like adding a `fit_predict` method and some way to store or expose the training data labels directly after fitting. The current search results indeed confirm the absence of a direct implementation for `fit_predict` in GaussianMixture or BayesianGaussianMixture, aligning with the issue's concerns. Nevertheless, the internal methods in BaseMixture could be utilized or modified to include such functionality without major architectural changes.",

Add a `labels_` attribute to store the labels of the training data. 3.
