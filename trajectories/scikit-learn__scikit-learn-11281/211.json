Key points include: MMs have an 'n_components' parameter analogous to 'n_clusters' in clusterers, they lack 'labels_' and 'fit_predict' methods that are standard in clusterers, and they are documented separately. To address this, we should focus on identifying and possibly modifying existing MM classes in the codebase to incorporate or align with clusterer-like features. This involves searching for classes related to mixture models and clusterers to assess interface differences and similarities.",

The search results include two files: 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py' and 'sklearn/base.py'. In 'gmm.py', the `_GMMBase` class includes an `n_components` parameter in its `__init__` method, which aligns with the `n_clusters` parameter similarity mentioned in the issue. Additionally, a `fit_predict` method is defined in 'gmm.py', suggesting that the addition of this method could address the missing API element in the mixture models. In 'sklearn/base.py', the `ClusterMixin` class provides a standard `fit_predict` method, which could serve as a blueprint for implementing this method in the mixture models. These code spans are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue as they directly relate to the lacking features in the mixture models' API when compared to clusterers.",

Key points in the issue are the absence of 'labels_' and 'fit_predict' methods in MMs, and the separate documentation of MMs. To address these, relevant code spans should include those related to the initialization of MM classes (to potentially add 'n_clusters' equivalent), and methods like 'fit_predict'. From the search results, 'GaussianMixture' and 'BayesianGaussianMixture' classes in 'sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py' and 'sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py' respectively, have constructors ('__init__' methods) which include 'n_components' parameter, a direct parallel to 'n_clusters' in clusterers. These classes also extend 'BaseMixture', which might need similar modifications. Additionally, 'GMM' and '_GMMBase' classes in 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py' also exhibit similar 'n_components' usage and a specific 'fit_predict' method, which can serve as a model for modifications. The 'sklearn/base.py' file defines 'ClusterMixin' which includes a 'fit_predict' method, indicating potential modifications for MMs to address the issue.",
