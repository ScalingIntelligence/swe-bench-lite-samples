Given the provided context, we should search for classes and methods related to mixture models and check if they implement these specific features.",

This includes having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_` of the training data, and having a `fit_predict` method. The search results provide several relevant code spans across different files. In `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, `_GMMBase` has a `fit_predict` method, which is relevant. In `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`, `GaussianMixture` initializes with `n_components`, which is similar to `n_clusters`. In `sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py`, `BayesianGaussianMixture` also initializes with `n_components`. In `sklearn/base.py`, `ClusterMixin` has a `fit_predict` method, which aligns with the needed functionality. In `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, `BaseMixture` contains a `score` and `predict` method, which are relevant but lack `labels_` storage. Overall, the code spans provide a good starting point to make MMs more like clusterers, but modifications are needed to store `labels_` and potentially conform more closely to the clusterer API.",

Additionally, the `ClusterMixin` class in `sklearn/base.py` provides a blueprint for the `fit_predict` method and uses the `labels_` attribute.
