Reviewing the search results, several relevant code sections were identified:\n\n1. **sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py** - Contains the `GaussianMixture` class which has an `n_components` parameter, aligning with the first point of the issue.\n2. **sklearn/base.py** - Contains `ClusterMixin` which includes a `fit_predict` method. This is relevant as MMs currently lack this method.\n3. **sklearn/mixture/gmm.py** - Deprecated `GMM` class, but shows a previous implementation of `fit_predict`.\n4. Other clusterer classes (e.g., DBSCAN, KMeans) which have `fit_predict` methods, suggesting that implementing such a method for MMs is in line with standard clusterers.\n\nThese findings indicate that modifying MMs to include `fit_predict` and perhaps storing `labels_` would bring them into closer alignment with common clusterer interfaces. The deprecated `GMM` class in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` suggests such modifications were previously considered but not fully implemented for the newer `GaussianMixture` class.\n\nThe search results are relevant to the issue, covering the necessary components and parameters discussed. However, further analysis of the entire code sections might be required to fully evaluate implementation feasibility and potential impact.",
