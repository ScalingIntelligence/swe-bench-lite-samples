Currently, mixture models have some differences compared to typical clusterers: they lack a `fit_predict` method, don't store `labels_`, and use `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`. To address this, we should search for the relevant classes and methods in the mixture models subdirectory, focusing on `GaussianMixture`, `_GMMBase`, and `BaseMixture` classes, as well as investigating the presence of `fit_predict` method. Additionally, it's important to check if these models appropriately handle or need to handle the `labels_` attribute and the `n_components` parameter.",

Key points include the absence of a `fit_predict` method and the `labels_` attribute in MMs. The search results reveal code spans in `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes that do not currently include a `fit_predict` method or store `labels_`. These classes also include a `n_components` parameter, similar to `n_clusters` in clusterers. The relevance of these spans to the issue at hand is clear: they are part of the Mixture Model implementation that needs to be aligned with the clusterer interface. Specifically, enhancing these classes by adding `fit_predict` and ensuring `labels_` storage would address the issue's concerns.",
