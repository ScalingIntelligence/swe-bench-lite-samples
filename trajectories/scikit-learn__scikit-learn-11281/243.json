The main points are the absence of a `labels_` attribute and a `fit_predict` method in mixture models, despite their similarities in functionality to clusterers. To align mixture models more closely with clusterers, we should look into the relevant classes and methods in the `sklearn/mixture` directory, especially those related to `BaseMixture`, `GaussianMixture`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture`, as well as the base classes like `BaseEstimator` and mixins like `ClusterMixin`.",

Key points mentioned include having an `n_components` parameter, lack of `labels_` storage, and absence of `fit_predict` method. The search results reveal relevant code spans that address these concerns. The `BayesianGaussianMixture` and `GaussianMixture` classes in `bayesian_mixture.py` and `gaussian_mixture.py` respectively, both inherit from `BaseMixture` and have an `n_components` parameter, similar to `n_clusters` in clusterers. Additionally, the `BaseEstimator` class in `base.py` provides methods for handling parameters, which is a common feature across estimators. However, neither `BayesianGaussianMixture` nor `GaussianMixture` directly address the storage of `labels_` or the `fit_predict` method, which are essential for aligning with clusterers. The `ClusterMixin` class in `base.py` defines the `fit_predict` method and is marked as a clusterer, indicating it's a candidate for adding these functionalities. Thus, while the current code provides a foundational structure for mixture models, additional implementations are needed to fully align with the clusterer interface.",
