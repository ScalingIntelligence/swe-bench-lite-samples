Key points of the issue include: 1) MMs have an `n_components` parameter analogous to `n_clusters` in clusterers, 2) MMs do not store `labels_` of training data, and 3) MMs lack a `fit_predict` method. The search results provide insights into the current implementation of mixture models in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` and `sklearn/mixture/base.py`. Here, we see class definitions for `_GMMBase` and `BaseMixture` which encompass the `n_components` parameter along with methods like `fit`, `predict`, `predict_proba`, and `fit_predict`, though only `_GMMBase` currently implements `fit_predict`. There's also a reference in `sklearn/base.py` to `ClusterMixin`, which is the base class for clusterers and includes the `fit_predict` method. Given these discrepancies highlighted in the issue, it makes sense to look for the pieces of code that could be altered or extended to align the API of MMs more closely with that of clusterers.",
