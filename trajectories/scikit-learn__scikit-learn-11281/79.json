MMs have similarities and differences compared to traditional clusterers. They share the `n_components` parameter with clusterers' `n_clusters`, but MMs lack `labels_` and `fit_predict` methods. The goal is to decide if MMs should adopt a more clusterer-like API. Relevant files include those defining the MM classes, their base classes, and the clusterer mixin. Focus should be on identifying or adapting MM classes to include `labels_` and `fit_predict` methods, and potentially reconciling documentation.",

Key points include having similar parameters (e.g., 'n_components' in GMMs vs 'n_clusters' in clusterers), storing 'labels_' of the training data as clusterers do, and implementing a 'fit_predict' method. In the provided search results from 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py', the '_GMMBase' class already contains an 'n_components' parameter which serves a similar purpose to 'n_clusters' in clusterers. Additionally, the 'fit_predict' method is present, albeit it returns the argmax of the fitting rather than storing 'labels_'. Therefore, these code spans address two of the three issues directly. It's notable that storing 'labels_' is not currently implemented within these spans, indicating that this aspect of the functionality would need additional development if the decision is made to align GMMs more closely with clusterers.",
