In the provided code span, we see that the `_GMMBase` class already has an `n_components` parameter, which aligns with the request to address this issue. Additionally, the class includes a `fit_predict` method, suggesting that this part of the issue is already somewhat addressed in the codebase.

The provided context shows that the _GMMBase class has a specific implementation for fit_predict, but it does not directly handle a 'labels_' attribute.

Key points from the issue include the need for MMs to have an `n_components` parameter that is equivalent to `n_clusters`, the absence of a `labels_` attribute for training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. The current context shows the `_GMMBase` class in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, which has the `n_components` parameter but lacks the `fit_predict` method and the `labels_` attribute. The search results provide various code spans in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, `sklearn/base.py`, `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`, and others, detailing classes like `_GMMBase`, `GMM`, `GaussianMixture`, `ClusterMixin`, etc. Relevant spans are those that either directly impact the API of MMs (like the `_GMMBase.__init__` with `n_components`, and the `fit_predict` from `ClusterMixin`) or could be used as examples or templates for adding missing functionalities (like `fit_predict` methods in other classes such as `KMeans`, `MiniBatchKMeans`, and `DBSCAN`). These findings align with the requirements to make MMs behave more like standard clusterers while also considering their probabilistic and inductive nature.",

The key points from the issue are: having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_` of the training data, and including a `fit_predict` method. The search results provide insights into the GMM class implementation in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, the base class in `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, and the GaussianMixture class in `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`. These files contain relevant code spans that can be analyzed to determine how closely they align with the clusterer interface requirements. The `_GMMBase` class, for example, already has a `fit_predict` method suggesting potential compatibility in method naming though not in data storage (it lacks `labels_`). The `GaussianMixture` class, which inherits from `BaseMixture`, seems to be designed more like an estimator than a clusterer, lacking methods related to cluster labelling. This analysis indicates areas in the search results, like the `_GMMBase.fit_predict` and the constructor of `GaussianMixture`, to review for improving its compatibility with clusterers as per the issue requirements.",

The _GMMBase class, which is a superclass for the deprecated GMM class, also does not directly manage a 'labels_' attribute, but its fit_predict method returns the component with the maximum responsibility for each data point, which could be interpreted as a form of labeling.
