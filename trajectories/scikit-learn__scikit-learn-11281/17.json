Key points from the issue include: 1) having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, 2) storing the `labels_` of the training data, and 3) including a `fit_predict` method. The search results show multiple files related to mixture models. Notably, sklearn/mixture/gmm.py contains a class `_GMMBase` with a method `fit_predict` that could be relevant for integrating a `fit_predict` method. The issue also mentions the lack of storing `labels_` which could be addressed by adding this functionality to the classes found such as `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`. The `n_components` parameter is already present and used across multiple classes, which aligns with one of the main suggestions from the issue. Therefore, it appears that making the mixture models more clusterer-like would involve integrating missing methods like `fit_predict` and possibly adding the `labels_` attribute. The provided search results are relevant as they show the foundational components needed to begin implementing these changes.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
