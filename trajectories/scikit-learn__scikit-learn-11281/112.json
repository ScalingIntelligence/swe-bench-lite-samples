However, it does not store the `labels_` attribute that is typically present in clusterers. Given that the `GMM` class inherits from `_GMMBase` and serves as a wrapper, it implies that other classes may also inherit from `_GMMBase` to form different types of mixture models.

The `fit_predict` method is indeed implemented, suggesting that at least part of the required functionality for making mixture models more like clusterers is present. Additionally, the `n_components` parameter is used similarly to `n_clusters` in other clusterers, which addresses one of the points mentioned in the issue. However, the issue mentions that mixture models do not store `labels_` of the training data, which is not explicitly shown in the provided context. Additionally, the file context does not show the documentation details or how the models are documented separately, which is another concern in the issue. Given these observations, while some relevant code is identified, not all aspects are fully covered. Further investigation into other subclasses of `_GMMBase` and related documentation would be beneficial.",
