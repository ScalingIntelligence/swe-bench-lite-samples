Key points involve having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, the absence of `labels_` storage and `fit_predict` method. Analyzing the provided code, I found several relevant areas: \n1. In `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`, the `GaussianMixture` class has the `n_components` parameter, which aligns with the mentioned parameter in the issue. This is crucial as the starting point for making mixture models more similar to clusterers.\n2. In `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, the `BaseMixture` class implements the `fit` method but lacks the `labels_` attribute and `fit_predict` method. This is indicative of where these additions or changes could be made to address the issue.\n3. In `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, the `_GMMBase` class has `predict` and `fit_predict` methods, which are relevant because the issue mentions the lack of a `fit_predict` method in mixture models. This shows a precedent for implementing this type of method.\n4. Lastly, `sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py` contains the `_DPGMMBase` class, which also extends `_GMMBase` showing further extensions where API changes might be considered.\nThese sections are all pertinent because they directly relate to the core functionalities and interfaces of mixture models that need to be adjusted or enhanced to be more compatible with clusterers as described in the issue. The identified code spans are good starting points for any modifications or additions needed to make mixture models more clusterer-like.",

However, neither class includes 'labels_' in their attributes nor have a 'fit_predict' method, as noted in the issue. Despite this, the GMM class, even though deprecated, does demonstrate a 'fit_predict' method, suggesting it was once considered but later deprecated. Thus, the current GMM implementation aligns with the issue's stated discrepancies from conventional clusterers. Regarding the API difference and the lack of 'fit_predict' in other mixture model implementations like GaussianMixture and BaseMixture, this confirms the current state described in the issue. While we see 'n_components' used similarly to 'n_clusters', the absence of 'labels_' and 'fit_predict' methods reinforces the distinction between mixture models and clusterers.

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
