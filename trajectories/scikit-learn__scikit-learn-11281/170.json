Key points include having an `n_components` parameter analogous to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_` of training data, and implementing a `fit_predict` method. The search results reveal that mixture models like GMM, GaussianMixture, and BayesianGaussianMixture do indeed have an `n_components` parameter with a similar purpose to `n_clusters`. However, they lack storing the `labels_` attribute and the `fit_predict` method in their current implementation. Specifically, in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, the `_GMMBase` class is shown with an `n_components` parameter in its constructor, but lacks `labels_` and `fit_predict` method. Similarly, the `GaussianMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` uses `n_components` but does not store `labels_` and lacks a `fit_predict` method. The `BayesianGaussianMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py` exhibits the same pattern. These findings confirm the issue's observation and suggest that the relevant code spans are the classes themselves and their initializers, specifically to inspect and possibly modify to include the missing features.",
