They should have an `n_components` parameter, similar to `n_clusters`.\n2. They should store the `labels_` of the training data.\n3. They should have a `fit_predict` method.\n\nFrom the search results, we can identify relevant code spans that align with these requirements. Specifically, in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, the `_GMMBase` class includes `n_components` in its `__init__` method, providing a parameter with a purpose similar to `n_clusters`. Additionally, the class has a `fit_predict` method and a `predict` method, which are necessary for compatibility with clusterers. The `_GMMBase` class also lacks the storage of `labels_`, which is a clear point of improvement according to the issue.\n\nSimilarly, in `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, the `BaseMixture` class provides a `fit` method and a `predict` method, closely aligning with functionality needed for a clusterer. If the goal is to make mixture models more like clusterers, one possible enhancement would involve adding a property to store `labels_` after they are computed. It's worth noting that both classes utilize common attributes like `n_components` and have fit and predict methods, making them strong candidates for integrating these changes to match a clusterer interface.\n\nThe identified spans point towards necessary functionality but may need further modifications or additions to address the `labels_` storage and possibly to enhance documentation to reflect their use as clusterers.\n\n",

Key points include the `n_components` parameter present in MMs but missing in clusterers, the lack of `labels_` in MMs, and the absence of `fit_predict` in MMs. The search results involve various components of the mixture models, including GaussianMixture and BayesianGaussianMixture. After analyzing the provided code spans, it is apparent that the relevant code spans for the reported issue primarily lie within the `GaussianMixture`, and `BaseMixture` classes in the `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` and `sklearn/mixture/base.py` files, as these are central to the functionality and interface of mixture models. These classes contain methods such as `__init__`, `predict`, and significant parameters like `n_components`, which directly relate to the issues mentioned. Additionally, the `GaussianMixture` class being a subclass of `BaseMixture` and implementing similar interfaces supports the idea of making MMs more clusterer-like without much additional complexity. Hence, the identified code spans should provide enough insight into how to address the reported issues regarding the interface differences between MMs and clusterers.",
