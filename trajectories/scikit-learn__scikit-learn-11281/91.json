The search results include a relevant section from `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` that contains the `_GMMBase` class. This class includes the `__init__` method defining the `n_components` parameter, similar to `n_clusters` in clusterers. Additionally, it has a `fit_predict` method, which aligns with the requirement of having a `fit_predict` method similar to clusterers.

Key points include: 1) MMs have an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`. 2) MMs lack `labels_` storage for training data. 3) MMs lack a `fit_predict` method. The issue suggests aligning MMs more closely with clusterers.\n\nGiven this, there are several relevant code sections in the search results:\n- `_GMMBase` class defines `n_components` similarly to `n_clusters` in clusterers, indicating a straightforward API alignment possibility.\n- The `fit_predict` method is defined in `_GMMBase` but is not part of its base implementation, suggesting it could be integrated to align with clusterers.\n- `GaussianMixture` class initialization mirrors that of `_GMMBase`, showing a consistent approach to handling `n_components` and other parameters.\n\nThese findings suggest that the codebase has the foundational elements needed to address the issue by integrating missing clusterer-like features into the mixture models.",

I then examined the provided file context and search results for code spans that address these elements. The main focus was on `_GMMBase`, `GaussianMixture`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes and their methods. From the search results, `_GMMBase.fit_predict` was found, which corresponds to the missing `fit_predict` method in the issue. Also, `_GMMBase.__init__` and `GaussianMixture.__init__` show the `n_components` parameter along with their implementations, suggesting they address the comparable parameter issue. Additionally, `BayesianGaussianMixture._set_parameters` potentially deals with the `labels_` attribute if labels are reachable through model parameters. These findings imply the search may be nearing completion as significant aspects of the issue (API discrepancies) are represented in the search results.",
