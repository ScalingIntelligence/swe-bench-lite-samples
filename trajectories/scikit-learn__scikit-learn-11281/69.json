We also need to ensure that these changes align with the existing clusterer API. From the search results, we find classes like `_GMMBase`, `BaseMixture`, `_DPGMMBase`, `VBGMM`, `BayesianGaussianMixture`, and `GaussianMixture` that handle different aspects of mixture models. Specifically, `_GMMBase` and its subclasses have methods like `fit`, `predict`, `score_samples`, and `fit_predict` which are crucial for making the mixture models more clusterer-like. The `BaseMixture` class provides a base for all mixture models and includes methods like `fit`, `score_samples`, `predict`, and `predict_proba` that are essential for the clusterer interface. The `_DPGMMBase` and `VBGMM` classes inherit from `_GMMBase` and implement specific functionalities for mixture models. The `BayesianGaussianMixture` and `GaussianMixture` classes also inherit from `BaseMixture` and provide more specialized implementations. These classes and methods are relevant to the reported issue as they address the necessary changes to make mixture models more compatible with clusterers.",

Key points of the issue are directly addressed in the file context: 1. The `n_components` parameter is indeed present across multiple classes with similar functionality to `n_clusters` in clusterers. 2. The lack of storage for `labels_` is not explicitly addressed in the provided code; however, the methods and properties are focused on probabilities and responsibilities, which aligns with the nature of mixture models. 3. The `fit_predict` method is identified in the code of `_GMMBase` and `GaussianMixture`, which provides compatibility with the clusterer interface expectations. Given the comprehensive nature of the code samples, it appears that the relevant file context for addressing the issue is mostly complete, though the exact implementation of `labels_` is missing.

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
