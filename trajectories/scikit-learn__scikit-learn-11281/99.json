The key points from the issue are: 1) MMs have an `n_components` parameter, similar to `n_clusters`. 2) MMs lack `labels_` storage and a `fit_predict` method. 3) MMs are documented separately. This implies a need to align MMs more closely with the API of clusterers.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant code spans are identified: \n\n1. `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` - This file contains the `GaussianMixture` class, which is a type of mixture model and includes the `n_components` parameter in its constructor (`__init__`), which aligns with the issue's mention of `n_clusters`. It is the primary class involved in mixture modeling.\n\n2. `sklearn/mixture/base.py` - The `BaseMixture` class, from which `GaussianMixture` inherits, also includes the `n_components` parameter, indicating that this parameter is central to all mixture models.\n\n3. `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` - This file contains the `_GMMBase` class, which is another example of a mixture model. Notably, it includes a `fit_predict` method (something missing in the `GaussianMixture` class), showing a relevant implementation that could help in aligning mixture models with clusterers.\n\nThese three files and their relevant spans are crucial for addressing the issue, as they cover the critical aspects of mixture models as mentioned in the issue.",
