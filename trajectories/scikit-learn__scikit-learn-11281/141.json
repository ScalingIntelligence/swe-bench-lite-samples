Key differences include the absence of a `labels_` attribute and `fit_predict` method in MMs, despite their clusterer-like nature. The search results contain code from `sklearn/mixture/base.py` and `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, revealing the implementation of MMs in Scikit-learn. Notably, the `BaseMixture` class and its methods are relevant, especially regarding the `n_components` parameter, which mirrors the `n_clusters` parameter in clusterers. Additionally, `_GMMBase` from `gmm.py` includes an implementation of `fit_predict`, which is currently absent in `BaseMixture`. These pieces of code are crucial for understanding how MMs can be aligned with the clusterer API. Therefore, the identified spans from `BaseMixture` and `_GMMBase` are relevant to the issue, suggesting potential areas for modification to align MMs more closely with the clusterer interface.",
