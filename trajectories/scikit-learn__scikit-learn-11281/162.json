From the search results, the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes in `gaussian_mixture.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py` respectively have the `n_components` parameter, similar to what is described. Additionally, the `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` has a `fit_predict` method which could be a reference for implementing this functionality in the mixture models. Therefore, these classes and their methods are relevant to the reported issue as they directly deal with the aspects mentioned. It seems the search task is not complete as the current search results do not include code spans where `labels_` are stored or used, which might indicate where changes would need to be made to align with the required clusterer interface.",

The key aspects of clustering are discussed: the use of `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), the absence of `labels_` attribute, and the absence of a `fit_predict` method in current mixture models. Analyzing the provided file context and search results, we can identify relevant code spans that align with these aspects. Notably, `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes from `gaussian_mixture.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py` files, respectively, both extend `BaseMixture` and initialize with `n_components` (mapping to `n_clusters` in clusterers). The search results do not directly provide `labels_` or `fit_predict` methods for these mixture models. However, the `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` does have a `fit_predict` method, indicating a possible template for implementing this functionality in modern Gaussian mixture models. The presence of `weight_`, `means_`, and `covariances_` attributes also suggests data members typically associated with clustering methods, further reinforcing the potential for alignment with the clusterer interface.",

Specifically, mixture models should have an `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), store `labels_`, and include a `fit_predict` method. Reviewing the new search results, it's clear that the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes currently do not store `labels_` nor have a `fit_predict` method, which are key requirements to be more clusterer-like. However, the `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` does have a `fit_predict` method, suggesting that this functionality might be present but not exposed in the more recent mixture model implementations. To address the issue, the relevant code spans would need to be identified and possibly extended or modified to include the missing functionalities, particularly focusing on adding the `fit_predict` method to the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes. Additionally, storing the `labels_` attribute should be considered.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
