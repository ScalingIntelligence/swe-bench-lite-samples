Key points include having an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, not storing `labels_`, and lacking a `fit_predict` method. The provided search results include a class `_GMMBase` from 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py', which has an `n_components` parameter and includes a method `fit_predict`. This class is likely part of the implementation for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which are a type of mixture model. The other search result is from 'sklearn/base.py' and defines a `ClusterMixin` class, which includes a `fit_predict` method. This suggests that making mixture models more like clusterers could involve integrating the `ClusterMixin` in the `_GMMBase` class. Based on these findings, the relevant code spans to address the issue are from the `_GMMBase` class in 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py', particularly the constructor where `n_components` is defined and the `fit_predict` method.",

From the provided search results, we can identify key code spans in the `gmm.py` file that relate to these aspects. The `_GMMBase` class includes both the constructor (`__init__`) where `n_components` is defined and the `fit_predict` method. This indicates that making MMs clusterer-compatible involves adjustments in these specific areas. Additionally, the `GMM` class, which is a deprecated version of the `_GMMBase` class, also defines `n_components` in its constructor and inherits from `_GMMBase`, further confirming the relevance of this file. In contrast, other files like `gaussian_mixture.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py` did not explicitly highlight key attributes or methods tied to the clusterer interface as significantly as `gmm.py` did. Consequently, the identified spans in `gmm.py` serve as a foundation to start implementing changes to align MMs with the clusterer interface as described in the issue.",
