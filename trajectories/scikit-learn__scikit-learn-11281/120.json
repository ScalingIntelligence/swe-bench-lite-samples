The search results provide a relevant class `_GMMBase`, which currently uses `n_components` and has a `fit_predict` method. Although it does not store `labels_` in the provided code, these results are highly relevant as they directly address the requirement for `n_components` and `fit_predict` method, making the MMs more clusterer-like.

Key points include the `n_components` parameter in MMs equivalent to `n_clusters` in clusterers, the absence of `labels_` in MMs, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MMs. The task is to determine if MMs should be made more like clusterers. To address this, it's crucial to identify code spans in existing clusterers that could serve as a template for changes in MMs. After analyzing the search results, it's clear that the `KMeans` class from `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py` is the most relevant, as it possesses the `n_clusters` parameter and both `fit` and `fit_predict` methods, which are absent in the current MMs. Therefore, the focus should be on these methods and parameters within the `KMeans` class to guide the modification of MMs.",
