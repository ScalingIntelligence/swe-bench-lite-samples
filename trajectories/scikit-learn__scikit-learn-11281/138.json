Specifically, mixture models lack a `labels_` attribute, a `fit_predict` method, and use `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`. The analysis of the search results reveals several relevant spans of code within the `BaseMixture` class and its subclasses, which manage the core functionalities and parameters of mixture models. These functionalities, such as initialization, fitting, and prediction methods, are key to the similarities and differences described in the issue. The identification of these code spans is crucial for understanding and potentially aligning the API with clusterers' characteristics.\n\nConsidering the nature of the task, the identified spans cover the essential features discussed in the issue. This includes the parameters `n_components` and `n_clusters`, the methods `fit` and `fit_predict`, and the lack of storing `labels_` in training data. The spans are relevant because they encapsulate the current structure and functionalities that define the mixture models and their deviations from traditional clusterers. The evaluation concludes that these spans are pertinent to addressing the issue and understanding the necessary modifications or enhancements.",

Key differences include the absence of `labels_`, no `fit_predict` method, and the use of `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`. The search results contain various cluster classes such as AffinityPropagation, Birch, DBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering, KMeans, and SpectralClustering, which have methods like `fit`, `predict`, and in some cases, `fit_predict`. These methods and attributes are relevant to address the issue by making MMs more clusterer-like. The search results do not directly include MM-related code but provide context on how clusterers are implemented in scikit-learn, which can guide the modifications needed for MMs. Therefore, further implementation would involve integrating these features into the MM class. Specifically, the identified spans in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` and `sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py` should be updated to include `labels_`, implement a `fit_predict` method, and ensure consistent handling of parameters like `n_components` and `n_clusters`.",

Relevant code spans include the `BaseMixture` class, which defines the basic interface for mixture models, and its methods such as `fit`, `predict`, and `score_samples`. Additionally, the `VBGMM` and `DPGMM` classes are relevant, as they are specific implementations of mixture models. The search results also cover other classes like `GaussianMixture` but are less directly relevant to the issue of making MMs more clusterer-compatible.
