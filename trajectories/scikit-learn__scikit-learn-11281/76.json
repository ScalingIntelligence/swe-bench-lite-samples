The key points identified are: 1) the `n_components` parameter should function similarly to `n_clusters`, 2) the inclusion of `labels_` for the training data, and 3) the addition of a `fit_predict` method. Reviewing the search results, we find several relevant code spans: \n\n- In `gaussian_mixture.py`, the `GaussianMixture` class definition includes the `n_components` parameter within its `__init__` method. This is a direct match for the issue's requirement.\n\n- In `gmm.py`, the `_GMMBase` class includes a `fit_predict` method, which is exactly what the issue is suggesting to add. This method could be a template for implementing a similar method in the mixture models.\n\n- In `base.py`, the `BaseMixture` class includes a `fit` method, which is relevant for understanding the fitting process within the mixtures.\n\n- In `bayesian_mixture.py`, the `BayesianGaussianMixture` class also uses the `n_components` parameter similarly to `GaussianMixture`, showing consistency in how the parameter is handled in different mixture model classes.\n\n- In `dpgmm.py`, the deprecated `VBGMM` class includes a `_fit` method that might be useful for understanding the fit process, though its use is discouraged due to deprecation.\n\nFrom these findings, it appears that the essential components for addressing the issue are present within the search results. However, further work is needed to integrate the `labels_` attribute and ensure that `fit_predict` methods are appropriately defined across the various mixture model classes.",
