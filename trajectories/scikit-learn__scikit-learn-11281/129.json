The main points of difference are the lack of `labels_` in mixture models, the absence of a `fit_predict` method, and variations in parameter naming (e.g., `n_components` vs `n_clusters`). To address this, it's necessary to investigate how these differences can be reconciled. The search should focus on the mixture model classes and their base classes to identify methods and attributes that should be added or modified for compatibility with clusterers.",

Key points include having an `n_components` parameter akin to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_`, and possessing a `fit_predict` method. The search results display multiple relevant code spans within classes like `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`. Notably, `GaussianMixture` already has an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, but lacks `labels_` storage and `fit_predict` method. Conversely, `_GMMBase` in `gmm.py` has a `fit_predict` method, though this specific class is not seen in the search results. To align MMs more closely with clusterers, implementing missing features such as `labels_` and `fit_predict` in `GaussianMixture` (as seen in `_GMMBase`) would address the reported issue.\n\nRelevant code spans from the search results are identified where `n_components`, relevant parameter checks, and core functionalities of MM modeling are defined. However, the specific spans lacking in the MM codebase that could be implemented to close the gap identified in the issue are `fit_predict` (needs creating) and `labels_` attribute (needs inclusion).",

From the search results, it's evident that the `GaussianMixture` class is missing a `fit_predict` method and does not store `labels_`. However, the `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` already has a `fit_predict` method, suggesting that it could serve as a model for implementing this in `GaussianMixture`. Additionally, both `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` need to ensure they store and possibly return the labels of the training data. Integration of these features from `_GMMBase` into `GaussianMixture` would align its API more closely with clusterers. Furthermore, the parameters `n_components` should be treated similarly to `n_clusters` in clusterers.",

This method applies the `_fit` method and then finds the argmax along axis 1, which implies that the data is being categorized, but the labels are not stored as a dedicated `labels_` attribute. To enhance compatibility with clusterers, it may be necessary to introduce a `labels_` attribute to store the results of the categorization.

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
