The main points of difference include the handling of parameters (`n_components` vs `n_clusters`), the absence of `labels_` in mixture models, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. To address this, we need to search for the implementations of mixture models and their methods to understand how these differences can be reconciled.",

The key points in the issue highlight differences such as the 'n_components' parameter versus 'n_clusters', the absence of 'labels_' storage, and lack of 'fit_predict' method in current GMM implementations. This analysis is crucial to understand where and how modifications should be made. The search results include multiple GMM-related classes such as '_GMMBase', 'GMM', 'GaussianMixture', 'BaseMixture', and 'BayesianGaussianMixture'. Each class contains methods like '__init__', 'score_samples', 'score', 'predict', 'predict_proba', 'fit_predict', and more. These methods are analyzed to identify which ones are currently operational and which might need to be added or modified to better align with traditional clustering interfaces in scikit-learn. For instance, adding or adjusting the 'fit_predict' method across classes could help achieve the desired behavior of simultaneously training the model and predicting cluster labels for new data. This systemic approach ensures that the API improvements under consideration impact a majority of relevant classes within the GMM and clustering framework.",
