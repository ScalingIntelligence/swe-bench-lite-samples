The analysis of the code spans reveals sections of the code for BaseMixture, GaussianMixture, and GMM classes within the sklearn/mixture/ directory. These classes already have an 'n_components' parameter in their constructors, and GaussianMixture class contains methods like '_check_parameters', '_estimate_log_prob', '_estimate_log_weights', etc., which are relevant for implementing MM functionality. However, none of the identified code spans directly implement the 'fit_predict' method or the storing of 'labels_' in the GaussianMixture class itself.

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
