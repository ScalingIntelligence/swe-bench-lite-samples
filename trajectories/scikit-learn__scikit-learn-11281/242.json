The key points to consider are: the presence of an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, the absence of `labels_` in the training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` file. Specifically, the `_GMMBase` class contains the `__init__` method where the `n_components` parameter is defined, which corresponds to the `n_clusters` in clusterers. Additionally, the class also contains the `_fit` method that involves the EM algorithm, essential for understanding the fitting process. Furthermore, the `distribute_covar_matrix_to_match_covariance_type` function is relevant as it handles covariance matrices, another critical aspect of the Mixture Models' functionality. Thus, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue of making MMs more like clusterers, as they address major dissimilarities.",

Additionally, the `_fit` method within this class is where the initial parameters are estimated using KMeans clustering, which could be an appropriate place to store the `labels_` as an instance variable. The current implementation does not explicitly store `labels_` but uses responsibilities during the EM iterations, which can be considered a form of soft labeling. This is a significant step towards making GMMs more clusterer-like. However, the absence of `labels_` as an explicit attribute suggests that further code may be needed in the `_fit` method to store these labels after the KMeans initialization or EM iterations. Thus, while significant parts of the required functionality are present, the complete implementation of `labels_` as an attribute might not yet exist in the provided file context.",
