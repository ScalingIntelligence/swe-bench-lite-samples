The issue mentions three key differences: 1) The presence of `n_components` in MMs, analogous to `n_clusters` in clusterers. 2) MMs lack a `labels_` attribute to store training data labels. 3) MMs do not implement a `fit_predict` method.\n\nReviewing the search results, the code spans provided in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` and `sklearn/mixture/base.py` are relevant to the issue. The `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` has `n_components`, lacks `labels_`, and the `fit_predict` method differs from typical clusterers. The `BaseMixture` class from `base.py` shows a similar structure. These files and their spans align with the reported differences in API, making them suitable candidates for adjusting MMs to be more clusterer-compatible.\n\nThe `sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py` file, though it contains mixture model classes, does not directly address the API concerns raised in the issue. Therefore, this file and its spans are less relevant for the immediate task of aligning MMs with clusterers.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans are from `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` and `sklearn/mixture/base.py`.",

Key points from the issue include the presence of an `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), the absence of `labels_` in training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. The provided file context and search results reveal relevant sections of code where these aspects are either implemented or can be adjusted to better align with clusterers.\n\n1. **GMM and BaseMixture classes** in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` and `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` contain methods and attributes like `n_components`, `fit`, `predict`, and `score_samples`, which are essential for clustering tasks. These are identified as relevant based on their function and the similarity to clusterers.\n\n2. The absence of `fit_predict` in some classes, as noted in the issue, suggests that relevant code spans involving methods like `fit` and `predict` should be considered, as implementing `fit_predict` would likely involve utilizing these methods. However, specific instances of `fit_predict` are not present in the provided code sections, indicating a potential area for improvement.\n\n3. Other classes like `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` also include similar methods, reflecting the modular design and inherent similarity between mixture models and clusterers. These classes are identified as relevant due to their close relationship with the functionality discussed in the issue.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they demonstrate the current implementation of key features and potential areas for adapting the mixture models' API to be more like clusterers. Further implementation or modification of specific methods like `fit_predict` could significantly align the two.",

Key points from the issue include having a 'fit_predict' method, storing 'labels_' for training data, and using 'n_clusters' instead of 'n_components'. Reviewing the provided codebase, we see that the mixture models currently do not implement a 'fit_predict' method and do not store 'labels_'. Additionally, they use 'n_components' instead of 'n_clusters'. Examining the new search results, we can identify several relevant code spans that could be modified to align mixture models more closely with the clusterer interface. For example, adding a 'fit_predict' method in the 'GaussianMixture' class could address one of the main concerns. However, the current codebase lacks a direct implementation of this method in the relevant classes. Modifying the 'predict' method and adding 'fit_predict' could be the approach to align the classes better with the clusterer interface as it would provide similar functionality. Furthermore, given the issue's focus on aligning mixture models with clusterers, it might also require changes to documentation to reflect these interface enhancements. The provided search results do not directly contain all the necessary changes but offer sufficient context and starting points for further development and modification to achieve the goal of making the mixture models more like traditional clusterers in terms of interface and functionality.",
