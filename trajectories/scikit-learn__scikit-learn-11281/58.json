The key points identified are the presence of an `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), the absence of `labels_` storage, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method. The mixture models are also documented separately. The goal is to determine if these models should be made more similar to clusterers in terms of interface.\n\nReviewing the provided code and search results, several relevant sections are identified:\n\n1. The `BaseMixture` class initialization (`BaseMixture.__init__`) where `n_components` is set, similar to `n_clusters` in clusterers. This parameter is highly relevant to the discussion.\n\n2. The `GaussianMixture` class initialization (`GaussianMixture.__init__`) which also sets `n_components`. This class inherits from `BaseMixture` and further customizes the initialization.\n\n3. The `_GMMBase.fit_predict` method, which is present in the `_GMMBase` class but not in the more modern `GaussianMixture` class. This method is a key feature in clusterers but missing in the current mixture models.\n\n4. The `BaseMixture.predict` method, which is relevant as it relates to the output of the model, typically needed in clustering but currently absent from the mixture models.\n\n5. The `GaussianMixture._check_parameters` method, which ensures the parameters are correctly set and validates the covariance type. This ensures that the model parameters are in line with the clusterer-like interface being discussed.\n\nThese sections of code are directly related to the interfaces and functionalities discussed in the reported issue. The identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the potential areas for alignment between mixture models and clusterers, suggesting that the search results are relevant to addressing the issue.",
