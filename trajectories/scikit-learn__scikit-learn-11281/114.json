Analyzing the provided code spans, the `GaussianMixture`, `BayesianGaussianMixture`, and older models like `GMM`, `DPGMM`, and `VBGMM` demonstrate varying degrees of alignments with these issues. Notably, `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` directly mention `n_components`, which is analogous to the desired `n_clusters` parameter. Furthermore, `GMM` includes a deprecated `fit_predict` method, suggesting a template for what could be implemented in more recent models. Given these observations, the relevant code spans are located in `gaussian_mixture.py`, `gmm.py`, and `bayesian_mixture.py` which focus on `n_components` or `n_clusters` equivalents and the potential to add methods like `fit_predict` to modern implementations.",

The `GMM` class, though deprecated, has a `fit_predict` method, which is a step towards the desired interface.

It specifically notes the absence of `labels_` and `fit_predict` methods in mixture models compared to clusterers. Additionally, it mentions the `n_components` parameter, which serves a purpose similar to `n_clusters` in clusterers. Given this context, I analyzed the new search results to find relevant code spans that could help address these discrepancies. In 'sklearn/mixture/base.py', the 'BaseMixture' class indeed lacks `fit_predict` and methods to store `labels_`, which are critical points in the issue. In 'sklearn/base.py', 'ClusterMixin' and 'OutlierMixin' both have `fit_predict` methods but do not define `labels_` directly within their classes. This suggests that for making mixture models like clusterers, we might need to either add or refactor these methods in the 'BaseMixture' class. The new search results provide a comprehensive look at the base class and mixins that could form the basis for aligning mixture models with clusterer functionality.",

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers.
