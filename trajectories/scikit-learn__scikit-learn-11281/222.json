The main points to consider are the `n_components` parameter, the absence of `labels_` in training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in mixture models. These aspects indicate that there are API differences that need to be aligned if we aim to make mixture models more like clusterers. The search should focus on identifying classes and methods within the mixture models that handle these aspects, particularly in the `sklearn/mixture` directory.

Notably, '_GMMBase' in 'gmm.py' has a 'fit_predict' method, which is a crucial element missing in the initial description of MMs. The 'GMM' and 'GaussianMixture' classes in their respective files also contain initializers with 'n_components', marking them as relevant for unifying the MM interface with clusterers. Additionally, 'BayesianGaussianMixture' in 'bayesian_mixture.py' implements more advanced parameters but still adheres to 'n_components'.

They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers.
