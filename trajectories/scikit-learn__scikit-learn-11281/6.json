Key differences include the absence of `labels_` and `fit_predict` method in mixture models, despite their function being very similar to clusterers. The files provided show various mixture model classes and their methods, but mainly focus on specific implementations like GMM, GaussianMixture, DPGMM, etc. To address the issue, we need to examine these classes and potentially the BaseMixture class for common interfaces. The goal is to assess whether these classes should implement methods like `fit_predict` and properties like `labels_` to align more closely with clusterers.",

From the search results, several relevant code spans are identified. In `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, the `_GMMBase` class and its `fit_predict` method are relevant. The `GMM` class, which is deprecated, also inherits from `_GMMBase`. In `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`, the `GaussianMixture` class is relevant, along with its `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. The `BaseMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` also contains relevant methods like `fit_predict`.

Key points include the presence of an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`, the absence of `labels_` for training data, and the lack of a `fit_predict` method in MMs. To make MMs more like clusterers, adjustments would need to align these aspects. From the provided search results, the code spans related to GMMs and GaussianMixtures have been identified as relevant. These spans include the `__init__`, `fit_predict`, and other method implementations. The additional search results confirm the presence of these methods and parameters, emphasizing their role in modifying the behavior of mixture models. Based on the analysis, the identified spans in `gmm.py`, `gaussian_mixture.py`, and `base.py` contain the necessary components to consider for implementing changes that would bring mixture models closer to the clusterer interface.",
