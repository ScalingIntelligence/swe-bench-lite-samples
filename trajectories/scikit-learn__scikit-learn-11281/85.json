Key points include the lack of a `fit_predict` method, absence of `labels_` attribute, and the use of `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`. The task is to identify code spans that might be relevant for aligning MMs with clusterers. Our analysis of the search results reveals several key points:\n\n1. `sklearn/base.py` contains the `ClusterMixin` class, which defines the `fit_predict` method, a critical element missing in MMs.\n2. `sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py` contains deprecated classes `DPGMM` and `VBGMM`, which have an `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`.\n3. `sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py` and `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` contain `BayesianGaussianMixture` and `GaussianMixture` classes, respectively, which are actively used and could benefit from the introduction of clusterer-like API features such as `fit_predict`.\n4. `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` contains a deprecated `GMM` class which also has an `n_components` parameter.\n\nBased on these findings, it is clear that modifications to the `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes could bring MMs closer to the clusterer interface by incorporating methods and attributes found in `ClusterMixin`. This would involve adding a `fit_predict` method and ensuring the `n_components` parameter is handled in a manner consistent with clusterers. The deprecated classes provide useful reference points but are not directly relevant for current implementations.",

Reviewing the provided file context and new search results, I identified the following relevant code spans: The `BaseMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` shares common parameters relevant to both mixture models and clustering, indicating a potential base for common functionality. Both `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture` classes in `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` and `sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py`, respectively, inherit from `BaseMixture` and define their own `__init__` methods, addressing the `n_components` parameter. This setup provides a foundational structure for integrating clustering-like features. Additionally, the `_GMMBase` class in `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` contains a `fit_predict` method, which is directly relevant to the missing feature in the current MM implementation, suggesting a potential reference or model for adding this functionality to the MMs. These findings align with the request to make MMs more like clusterers, providing crucial elements that can be expanded or modified to meet the desired interface alignment.",

Key points to address are the presence of an `n_components` parameter, the absence of `labels_` storage, and the missing `fit_predict` method. The current codebase has several relevant files, including `base.py`, `gaussian_mixture.py`, `bayesian_mixture.py`, and `gmm.py`. From the provided context, mixture models do have an `n_components` parameter akin to `n_clusters` in clusterers. The `BaseMixture` class serves as a base for `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`, which do not store `labels_` or implement `fit_predict`. The search results suggest the `_GMMBase` class in `gmm.py` does implement `fit_predict`, which aligns with the clusterer interface. Additionally, `ClusterMixin` in `base.py` defines the `fit_predict` method, further confirming the clusterer interface convention. Thus, making mixture models more like clusterers could involve adopting the `ClusterMixin` and implementing or adjusting methods like `fit_predict` and storing `labels_`.",

Furthermore, the `BaseMixture` class, which is a common superclass for `GaussianMixture` and `BayesianGaussianMixture`, does not implement the `fit_predict` method, nor does it define the `labels_` attribute.
