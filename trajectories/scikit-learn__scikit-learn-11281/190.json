Key points of divergence include the absence of a `labels_` attribute and `fit_predict` method in MM implementations like `GaussianMixture`. The issue suggests that MM should be more like clusterers by adopting their API, which includes these features. The search results provide examples from the codebase that could serve as a template for modifying Mixture Models to more closely resemble clusterers. Relevant files and methods identified include `KMeans` with its `fit_predict` method in `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py`, native `fit_predict` implementations in `BaseMixture` and `_GMMBase` in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` and `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, respectively. Additionally, examples from other clustering and mixture model-related classes show the presence of `fit_predict` methods, suggesting that implementing such methods in Mixture Models would align more closely with the standard clusterer API in scikit-learn. This would involve not only adding methods but also possibly storing the training data labels in a `labels_` attribute, similar to what is done in the `KMeans` class. However, it's important to note that there might be complexities due to the probabilistic nature of Mixture Models, which may require careful handling in their implementation of 'cluster' functionality while maintaining their unique traits.",
