Mixture models, while functionally similar to clusterers in some aspects (like the use of `n_components`), have significant API differences such as the absence of `labels_` and `fit_predict` methods. To address this, the search should focus on the `sklearn/mixture/` directory, targeting classes like `GaussianMixture`, `GMM`, and their base classes to find the code responsible for these differences. This will help in assessing whether these methods or attributes can be added or modified to bring mixture models closer to the clusterer interface.",

The provided code in the search results includes '_GMMBase' and 'GaussianMixture' classes which have similar parameters and methods to those suggested by the issue. For instance, both classes have an 'n_components' parameter akin to 'n_clusters'. They also have methods like 'predict', 'predict_proba', 'score', and 'fit', which align with typical clusterer behaviors. The 'GaussianMixture' class does not currently have a 'fit_predict' method, which could be added to more closely resemble clusterers. However, '_GMMBase' does have a 'fit_predict' method. Both classes should also consider adding 'labels_' attribute to store the training data labels. The analysis of the provided code suggests that the 'sklearn/mixture/gmm.py' and 'sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py' files are highly relevant to the issue. Thus, the focus should be on enhancing these classes to include the missing clusterer features. If these enhancements are made, the MMs will be more in line with typical clusterers without deviating from their probabilistic and inductive nature.",

The key points to focus on are: the presence of `n_components` parameter (akin to `n_clusters`), the lack of `labels_` storage, and the absence of `fit_predict` method in MMs. The analysis indicates that both `GaussianMixture` and `_GMMBase` classes in the provided code spans should be considered relevant as they associate with MM functionalities. Notably, `_GMMBase` class addresses the concern of missing `fit_predict` method by containing an implementation of the same (span id: '_GMMBase.fit_predict'). Additionally, the `KMeans` class from `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py` provides a comparison point with its own `fit_predict` method (span id: 'KMeans.fit_predict'), illustrating how clusterers typically handle this method. Thus, these spans are crucial for understanding the potential changes needed to align MMs more closely with clusterers.",
