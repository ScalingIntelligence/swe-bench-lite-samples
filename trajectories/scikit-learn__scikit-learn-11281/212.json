Currently, mixture models differ in several ways from typical clusterers, such as having an 'n_components' parameter instead of 'n_clusters', not storing 'labels_' and lacking a 'fit_predict' method. To address this, we should focus on identifying classes related to mixture models and checking for implementations of 'fit_predict', 'n_components', and 'labels_'.",

Key points to address are the presence of `n_components` parameter similar to `n_clusters`, the absence of `labels_` attribute, and the lack of `fit_predict` method. The provided search results include several files which potentially contain relevant code spans. Notably, we see BaseMixture, GaussianMixture, and other clusterers with similar patterns, such as DBSCAN, KMeans, and Hierarchical clustering methods, which all provide `fit_predict` methods and store `labels_`. This context suggests that making MMs more clusterer-compatible would likely involve modifying these classes to include a `fit_predict` method and possibly adding a `labels_` attribute. We also see _GMMBase and Pipeline as examples of where these changes might be applied, though not exhaustive of all necessary actions. This analysis indicates that the search results are relevant to the issue as they show where implementations may diverge and should align for consistency.",

The key points are: having `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), storing `labels_`, and having a `fit_predict` method. From the provided file context and search results, I have identified relevant code spans that address these points. In `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, the `_GMMBase` class and its `__init__` and `fit_predict` methods are relevant as they deal with `n_components` and provide a `fit_predict` method. In `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, the `BaseMixture` class and its `__init__` method are relevant for initializing `n_components` and other parameters. In `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py`, the `GaussianMixture` class and its `__init__` method are relevant for initializing parameters, including `n_components`. Additionally, the `ClusterMixin` class in `sklearn/base.py` is relevant as it provides the `fit_predict` method, suggesting a reference implementation that could be adapted. The search results confirmed the presence of `BaseMixture` and `GaussianMixture` classes and their initialization methods, which align with the issue's requirements. Overall, the identified code spans are relevant and suggest potential points for integrating clusterer-like functionality into mixture models.",

  "initial_message": "Should mixture models have a clusterer-compatible interface\nMixture models are currently a bit different. They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\r\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\r\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\r\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\r\n\r\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\r\n\r\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n"
