This behavior differs from matplotlib version 3.4.3, where it works fine. The search results provided contain relevant code spans that might explain or be related to the issue. Specifically, the '_apply_style' function is responsible for applying a style, and the 'use' function includes a `fix_style` function that handles style aliases and deprecation warnings. The 'fix_style' function includes a section that specifically handles 'seaborn-colorblind' and other related styles, issuing a deprecation warning and modifying the style name to 'seaborn-v0_8-<style>'. This suggests that 'seaborn-colorblind' is indeed deprecated in version 3.6.1, which would explain the KeyError. The 'context', 'update_user_library', 'read_style_directory', 'update_nested_dict', and 'reload_library' functions likely manage how styles are loaded and updated within the library, but as per the input details, these are not directly related to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to investigate further for a fix or workaround are 'use' and specifically the 'fix_style' function handling of 'seaborn-colorblind'.",
