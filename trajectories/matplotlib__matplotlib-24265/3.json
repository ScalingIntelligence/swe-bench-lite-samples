This function checks if the style is in the 'style_alias' dictionary or directly in the 'library'. It also includes a warning message indicating that seaborn styles are deprecated in version 3.6 and provides a new format for these styles. This section of code is highly relevant as it directly addresses the issue of style handling and specifically mentions 'seaborn-colorblind'. Additionally, the '_apply_style' function is relevant as it updates the matplotlib rcParams, which could be where the key error originates. The other functions such as 'read_style_directory', 'update_user_library', and 'reload_library' are also relevant as they deal with loading and updating the style library, which is directly related to the issue at hand.",

The code snippets in the file context seem sufficient to infer that the 'seaborn-colorblind' style should be managed appropriately if all style handling mechanisms are intact.
