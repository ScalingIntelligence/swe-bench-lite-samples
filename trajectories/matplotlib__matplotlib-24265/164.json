In examining the provided file context and new search results, it appears that the '_apply_style' and 'use' functions in the core.py file are particularly relevant. The 'use' function contains logic that handles the modification of style names like 'seaborn-colorblind' and includes a deprecation warning starting from version 3.6. This functionality directly relates to the issue, as it suggests that styles like 'seaborn-colorblind' have been deprecated and possibly removed from the library in version 3.6.1, which would explain the KeyError. The analysis of both the file context and search results consistently points to these sections of the code as the most relevant to the reported issue.",

I recently installed my code on a machine with matplotlib version 3.6.1 and upon importing my code, this generated a key error for line `the_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]` saying \"seaborn-colorblind\" was a bad key.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nthe_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nKeyError: 'seaborn-colorblind'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nseaborn-colorblind should be set as the matplotlib library style and I should be able to continue plotting with that style.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- Bug occurs with matplotlib version 3.6.1\r\n- Bug does not occur with matplotlib version 3.4.3\r\n- Tested on MacOSX and Ubuntu (same behavior on both)\n\n### Operating system\n\nOS/X\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.1\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nMacOSX\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9.7\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
