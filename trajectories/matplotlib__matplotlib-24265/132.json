This works in version 3.4.3 but fails in 3.6.1, suggesting a change in the library handling of styles. The goal is to locate the relevant code in the matplotlib package that manages style libraries. Given the error, it's reasonable to focus on the 'core.py' and '__init__.py' files in the matplotlib/style directory, which are suspected to contain the logic for style handling. Additionally, since the issue is version-specific, it might be useful to inspect any version-related configurations or changes in the setup.py.",

The search results provided include parts of the setup.py file, which is responsible for configuring and building the matplotlib package. Key sections include version checks, backend settings, and style management during the build process. Specifically, the 'update_matplotlibrc' function modifies the matplotlibrc file to set the backend during the build. This function and its context could be relevant to understanding how styles like 'seaborn-colorblind' are handled in different versions. The results do not directly show functionality related to style libraries or specific style inclusion, which could support understanding the change in behavior between versions.

This works fine with v3.4.3 but fails with v3.6.1. The relevant code spans should focus on where the style library is defined, loaded, and accessed. The `setup.py` context suggests it might involve how styles are configured or updated. From the search results, `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py` seems highly relevant as it contains definitions for `library`, which could directly relate to the KeyError experienced involving the 'seaborn-colorblind' style. Additionally, `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` contains general initialization and version checking which might indicate broader inconsistencies within version-specific behaviors. The `pyplot.py` file also appears relevant due to its direct interaction with styles and possibly deprecated or changed functionalities across version updates.",

It suggests a need to verify where else these style mappings or deprecations are handled and ensure they are reflected correctly throughout the package.

Alternatively, examining past commit histories around the version in question (matplotlib 3.6.1) or scrutinizing modification logs for style handling features could offer detailed insights and more context onto the problem at hand.

I recently installed my code on a machine with matplotlib version 3.6.1 and upon importing my code, this generated a key error for line `the_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]` saying \"seaborn-colorblind\" was a bad key.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nthe_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nKeyError: 'seaborn-colorblind'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nseaborn-colorblind should be set as the matplotlib library style and I should be able to continue plotting with that style.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- Bug occurs with matplotlib version 3.6.1\r\n- Bug does not occur with matplotlib version 3.4.3\r\n- Tested on MacOSX and Ubuntu (same behavior on both)\n\n### Operating system\n\nOS/X\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.1\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nMacOSX\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9.7\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
