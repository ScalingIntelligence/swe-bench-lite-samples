Given this, the relevant code spans should directly relate to the management and availability of styles in matplotlib.

The 'use' span in this file contains logic for applying styles, including a deprecation warning for certain seaborn styles, which aligns with the behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the '__getattr__' span in 'style/core.py' contains module-level deprecations, which could explain why 'seaborn-colorblind' might no longer be available as expected in version 3.6.1.

        "message": "From the file context provided, it appears that the handling of styles in `matplotlib` has undergone changes, particularly with the deprecation warning for seaborn styles in version 3.6.1. The `fix_style` function inside the `use` function shows that 'seaborn-colorblind' and other seaborn styles are being replaced with 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind'. This suggests that the direct use of 'seaborn-colorblind' is deprecated and has been renamed. To address the original issue, the user should update their code to use the new style name or consider using the seaborn API directly.",
