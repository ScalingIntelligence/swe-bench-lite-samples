This discrepancy suggests a change in the library's handling of styles between these versions. To diagnose this, we should focus our search on the code related to matplotlib's style handling, especially in the core module where styles are managed. We should specifically look for the definition and management of the style library and how styles like 'seaborn-colorblind' are handled or included.",
