The reported issue specifically mentions that this works in matplotlib version 3.4.3 but fails in version 3.6.1. This indicates a change in behavior between these versions. Examining the search results, I found relevant code spans in 'lib/matplotlib/style/core.py' that deal with handling styles and their updates. Specifically, the '_apply_style', 'use', 'context', 'update_user_library', 'read_style_directory', 'update_nested_dict', and 'reload_library' functions are directly involved with managing styles. The code includes a deprecated warning for seaborn styles in version 3.6, which suggests that these styles are no longer supported in the same way as they were in previous versions. This aligns with the reported issue's description of a key error in version 3.6.1. The function 'fix_style' in 'use' also shows the replacement of 'seaborn' styles with 'seaborn-v0_8', which could explain why 'seaborn-colorblind' is no longer a valid key in version 3.6.1. Furthermore, the 'reload_library' function reinitializes the library, which might be necessary to reflect the changes in available styles between versions. Overall, these code spans provide a clear understanding of how styles are managed and why the 'seaborn-colorblind' style might not be available or treated differently in version 3.6.1.",

The function '_apply_style' is relevant as it is responsible for updating the matplotlib settings according to the chosen style. Additionally, the handling of the 'seaborn-colorblind' and related styles within the 'use' function indicates that there is recognition of these styles. However, there is a deprecation warning for these styles in version 3.6.1, suggesting that these styles might no longer be directly supported. Given this information, I believe the file context is relevant, but due to the deprecation, further investigation should be done to understand how styles from external libraries (like seaborn) are integrated and handled differently in version 3.6.1 compared to previous versions.
