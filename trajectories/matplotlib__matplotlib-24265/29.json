This suggests that the 'seaborn-colorblind' style might have been removed or changed in the newer version of matplotlib. We should start by looking for changes related to the 'style.library' in the matplotlib codebase, especially in files that handle styles and their library. Since the error occurs in version 3.6.1, looking at the differences between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1 might be helpful. The 'core.py' and '__init__.py' files in the style directory are likely places to start.",

Specifically, the `use` function includes a deprecation warning for seaborn styles and renames 'seaborn-colorblind' to 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind'. This suggests that the 'seaborn-colorblind' style was deprecated and replaced, which would explain the KeyError in version 3.6.1.
