This suggests a potential change in the library or its configuration setup between versions. The relevant code snippet that throws the error is `the_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]`. Since the error occurs when accessing `plt.style.library`, it's crucial to focus on the `style` module in matplotlib, particularly `core.py`, as well as the file where `library` is defined or initialized. Additionally, the `pyplot.py` file should be examined as it might call or define aspects related to `plt.style`.",
