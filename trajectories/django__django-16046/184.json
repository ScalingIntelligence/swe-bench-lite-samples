Specifically, the issue arises when the 'if str_number[0] == \"-\"' condition encounters a null number field, leading to an 'IndexError: string index out of range'. This error is likely to occur in the 'format' function, a central part of this module. The search results confirm the presence of the 'format' function and the problematic condition within it, exactly as described in the issue. The attention should focus on the 'format' function as the relevant location where the issue manifests. All checks to identify negative numbers should include safeguards against null values to prevent such errors. Therefore, the span containing the 'format' function is directly relevant to the reported issue. Furthermore, considering the immediate need to resolve this bug, adding a null check before accessing any array elements will be essential for the fix.",
