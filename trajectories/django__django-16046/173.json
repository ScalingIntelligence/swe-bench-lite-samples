This line is causing an 'IndexError: string index out of range' when `str_number` is null or empty. The proposed fix involves checking if `str_number` is empty before attempting to access its first character. The relevant code spans in the search results are within the `format` function where this condition is checked. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are: 1. the entire function definition of `format` which encapsulates the problematic line and surrounding logic. This will allow for a comprehensive context of where and how to apply the fix.
