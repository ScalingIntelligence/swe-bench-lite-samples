The issue is likely occurring when str_number is an empty string or None, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the first character. The relevant code spans are in the 'format' function within django/utils/numberformat.py. Specifically, the check if str_number[0] == '-' needs to be safeguarded against the possibility of str_number being None or empty, which could be caused by a null input. Additionally, the display_for_field function in django/contrib/admin/utils.py should be reviewed to ensure it properly handles null values before passing them to the format function, although it seems to handle None cases appropriately at a high level.",
