Additionally, the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file contains functions like `display_for_field` and `display_for_value` which might be relevant for how the admin list_display handles formatting of values. The fix might involve checking for null values before attempting to format them.

This function deals with formatting numbers, including checking for negative signs at the beginning of the string representation of the number.
