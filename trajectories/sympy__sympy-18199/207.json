Specifically, when `a % p == 0`, `x = 0 mod p` should be considered a root. The provided search results include several functions that are relevant, such as `sqrt_mod`, `sqrt_mod_iter`, and `_nthroot_mod1`. The `nthroot_mod` function itself is also present in the search results, which is central to resolving the issue. The analysis focuses on identifying the areas where the condition `a % p == 0` might be missing or where a check for the root `0 mod p` might be needed. Additionally, considering that the issue relates directly to handling specific conditions in modular arithmetic, other functions like `n_order`, `primitive_root`, and `discrete_log` are also reviewed to ensure comprehensive understanding for potential needed modifications. The identified spans of code are those where modifications might be necessary to address the outlined issue effectively.\n\n1. **nthroot_mod Function**: This is the primary function where the issue of missing roots needs to be addressed. The code block includes the handling of specific cases related to prime and non-prime conditions, which directly influence how roots are computed.\n\n2. **_nthroot_mod1 Function**: A helper function used within `nthroot_mod` to handle the calculation of nth roots under specific conditions, especially where the order and prime characteristics are directly used. This function has conditional execution based on properties of `p-1`, which is crucial for understanding how roots, including `0 mod p`, are managed.\n\n3. **sqrt_mod and sqrt_mod_iter Functions**: These functions deal with square roots in modular arithmetic, which are similar to the nth roots problem mathematically. The methods used in these functions, especially around the concept of modular square roots, can provide insights into handling nth roots in a similar modular context.\n\nBy analyzing these sections of the code, we can determine where additional checks or modifications might be required to ensure that when `a % p == 0`, `x = 0 mod p` is correctly identified as a root within the `nthroot_mod` function.",

Specifically, when `a = 0 mod p`, the function should return a root `0 mod p`, but it doesn't. The current context includes functions like `sqrt_mod`, `discrete_log`, and `nthroot_mod`, all of which could be relevant. The new search results also contain these functions, plus `n_order` and `mobius`, but the core functions `sqrt_mod`, `discrete_log`, and `nthroot_mod` are the most directly relevant to the issue. The `nthroot_mod` function itself is present, so it's likely that the adjustment to address the issue will be made within this function. Based on the pattern of code usage in the provided context and the specific issue mentioned, it seems that the search results are relevant and sufficient to address the issue. The only concern is whether the existing code within `nthroot_mod` properly handles the case where `a % p == 0`, which might require an additional check and the inclusion of `0` as a root in such cases.",
