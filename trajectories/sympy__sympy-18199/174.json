To address this, it's crucial to identify the section of the code responsible for handling these cases. Here are the key points considered:\n\n1. **Function Analysis**: We need to locate the exact point where the function should check for `a % p == 0` and handle the condition where `x = 0 mod p` should be a valid root.\n2. **Relevant Code Spans**: The provided search results include the `nthroot_mod` function, as well as its internal functions like `_nthroot_mod1` and `_nthroot_mod2`. These functions are prime candidates because they involve calculations to find `n`-th roots modulo `p`.\n3. **Needs Addition**: There doesn't appear to be explicit handling of the case where `a % p == 0`. Given the issue description, it seems we need to add a check for this condition.\n\n### Considerations and Decisions:\n- I did not include the `mobius` function and its internal methods (`mobius.eval`) as they are unrelated to root calculations.\n- The `discrete_log` and its associated functions (`_discrete_log_pohlig_hellman`, `_discrete_log_trial_mul`, etc.) are also excluded as they deal with discrete logarithms, not roots.\n- Similarly, functions like `n_order`, `primitive_root`, `sqrt_mod_iter`, etc., although dealing with modular operations, are not directly related to the specific issue at hand.\n- I included the `nthroot_mod` function and its two internal functions (`_nthroot_mod1` and `_nthroot_mod2`) because they are expected to be the places where changes might be needed to fix the identified issue.\n\nIncluded: `nthroot_mod` and its two internal functions, which are the primary code spans dealing directly with the function's purpose and logical errors.\n\nBy concentrating on these specific functions, I aim to provide a more targeted and effective solution to the issue at hand.",
