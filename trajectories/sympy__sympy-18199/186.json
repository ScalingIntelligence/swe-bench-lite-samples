The search results provided include several functions and portions of code that are relevant to nth roots and modular arithmetic, which are likely places where the issue could be addressed. The `nthroot_mod` function itself is identified, and its logic seems to rely on helper functions like `_nthroot_mod1`, which could be inspected in more detail. Additionally, the `sqrt_mod` and `sqrt_mod_iter` functions, which deal with square roots in modular arithmetic, are also included. Given the complexity of the code, it would be prudent to not only focus on the `nthroot_mod` function but also to look into the supporting functions involved in calculating nth roots in modular arithmetic.",
