After examining the file context and the search results, it appears that there is no existing code that directly addresses this issue within the `nthroot_mod` function itself. However, the search results do contain functions related to root finding in polynomials, which might be relevant for implementing or modifying the `nthroot_mod` function to include the missing check for x = 0 mod p. Specifically, functions like `roots_linear`, `roots_quadratic`, and `roots` are relevant as they deal with finding roots of polynomials, which directly relates to the root-finding logic that could be missing in `nthroot_mod`. These functions could provide insights or even directly support the modification necessary to ensure `nthroot_mod` correctly identifies the root x = 0 mod p when applicable.",
