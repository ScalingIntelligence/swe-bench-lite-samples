These functions deal with modular roots and could be relevant to addressing the issue. Additionally, the `primitive_root` function, which is used in the calculation of roots, could also be relevant for understanding the underlying logic in `nthroot_mod`.

This suggests that the code might miss handling this condition explicitly. Given the complexity of the function and its dependencies, it's crucial to ensure that the condition `a % p == 0` is addressed to guarantee that all roots are considered, particularly when `x = 0 mod p` is a valid root. Since the file context covers the primary function and its supporting logic, it provides a complete view necessary to understand and potentially fix the issue, even though the exact check for `a % p == 0` might be implicit or require additional introspection within the function's logic.",
