This specifically happens when `a % p == 0` in the equation `x**n = a mod p`. The search results provide various relevant functions and spans, especially around the `nthroot_mod` and auxiliary functions used within it. The spans '_nthroot_mod1', '_nthroot_mod2', and 'nthroot_mod' are directly related to the calculation of nth roots modulo p. Additionally, functions like 'sqrt_mod' and 'sqrt_mod_iter' are relevant as they handle square roots modulo p, which shares similarities with the nth root case when n equals 2. Overall, the search results contain essential functions and logic intertwined with the core issue, providing a thorough starting point for examining the current implementation. The provided code spans reveal existing checks and calculations related to residue calculations, modular arithmetic, and prime number theory, which are crucial for resolving the missing root issue.",
