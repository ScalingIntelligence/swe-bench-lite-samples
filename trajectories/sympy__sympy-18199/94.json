Specifically, when x = 0 mod p, this should be a root, but the current implementation of `nthroot_mod` does not check for this condition. The provided code snippet includes the `nthroot_mod` function, which is the primary focus for addressing the issue. The function `nthroot_mod` calls `_nthroot_mod1` and handles the scenario where (p - 1) % n == 0. However, it lacks a condition to handle the case when a % p == 0, which would directly imply x = 0 as a root. Additionally, the function `sqrt_mod` (which is essentially `nthroot_mod` for n=2) also does not have a specific check for a % p == 0. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans to focus on are the `nthroot_mod`, `_nthroot_mod1`, and potentially `sqrt_mod` to ensure that x = 0 is correctly identified as a root when applicable.",
