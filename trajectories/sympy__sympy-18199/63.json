Given the description, it's evident that the function does not properly handle the case where 'a' modulo 'p' equals 0, which should yield a root of 0 modulo 'p'. Based on the provided file snippets, it seems relevant to look specifically into the `nthroot_mod` function within `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py` for potential code modifications to address this case. Also, considering the nature of the issue, it might be useful to delve into how other modular root functions are implemented to gather insights or potential improvements for error handling and root discovery under the given condition.",

The closest related function, `nthroot_mod(a, n, p, all_roots=False)`, does not explicitly handle the case of `a % p == 0`. Therefore, a new condition or modification to the existing logic would be required to address this specific case.

Additionally, examining the `_sqrt_mod1` function which handles specific cases for modular square roots could provide insights on how similar checks might be implemented for the `nthroot_mod` function.
