Specifically, the `--msg-template` argument seems to be parsed differently in pylint 2.12.2 compared to pylint 1.7.4. To understand why this is happening, we should focus on the `pylint/reporters/text.py` file, as it contains the `TextReporter` class which handles message templates. Additionally, we should investigate the `handle_message` and `write_message` methods within `TextReporter` as they are involved in processing messages. \nAlso, the `format`, `msg_template`, and `option_groups` methods in the `PyLinter` class within `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` might provide additional context on how message templates are managed in pylint.",

However, the issue with custom braces is still not directly addressed in the context provided. The `PyLinter` class initialization and `option_groups` property do provide some context but do not directly address the issue with message templating. The `TextReporter` class's `write_message` method seems to be the closest to the issue as it involves formatting messages using a template. However, the `_fixed_template` used in `TextReporter` is initialized from `self.line_format`, which might not be handling custom braces correctly, leading to the reported issue. To fully understand and address the issue, it's crucial to investigate further into how `self._fixed_template` is determined, possibly in the `__init__` method or any other method that modifies or validates the message template. Additionally, looking into other methods within `TextReporter` that might be involved in template processing such as `on_set_current_module` could be beneficial.",

The issue specifically outlines that the message template ```{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}``` works in older versions but not in pylint 2.12.2 with Python3.9. This discrepancy suggests a change in how message templates are handled. The relevant part of the codebase lies within the TextReporter class in text.py, specifically the `on_set_current_module` method. This method is responsible for setting the current module and handling the template, which includes parsing the message template and checking if all parts in the template are valid fields. The method emits a warning if it encounters an unrecognized argument in the message template, which aligns with the warning message seen in the issue report. Therefore, the focus should be on the `on_set_current_module` method and its handling of the message template.",
