This function raises a 'FieldDoesNotExist' exception if the field isn't found, which leads to an 'AttributeError' that isn't currently covered by error E108. The provided search results contain the 'label_for_field' function and the '_get_non_gfk_field' function, both of which are directly related to the issue as they handle the field lookup and exception raising. Additionally, I spotted a 'Choice' class in another file which might be a model definition related to the 'choice' field mentioned in the issue.
