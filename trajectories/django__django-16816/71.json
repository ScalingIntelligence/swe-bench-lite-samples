The traceback reveals a FieldDoesNotExist exception, indicating that Django cannot find the 'choice' field on the Question model. Given the context, it would be beneficial to identify code spans that deal with model definitions, specifically the Question and Choice models, and any related admin configurations. Considering the search results, the 'Choice' model definition in 'django/utils/regex_helper.py' could be relevant, as it might define the Choice model used in the QuestionAdmin. Additionally, code spans related to filters in 'django/contrib/admin/filters.py' could also be pertinent since the admin interface functionality and how fields are handled might be relevant to this issue. Thus, these code spans might provide insights into how such errors can arise and how they might be handled or avoided in Django's admin utilities.",
