The traceback indicates that the error occurs in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` at the `label_for_field` function, which tries to find the field 'choice' on the `Question` model and fails. This error should be handled better, and the user suggests updating error E108 to cover this case. From the search results, the relevant code spans are in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` under the `ModelAdmin` class, which defines model administration options, and `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` under the `label_for_field` function, which is where the error is being raised. These sections are critical for understanding how the Django admin handles fields and how it could be improved to handle the case where a field does not exist on a model.

The error specifically points to the line where '_get_non_gfk_field' is called, which raises 'FieldDoesNotExist'.

The 'options.py' file contains classes like 'ModelAdmin' which define how models are represented and managed in the admin interface, including how fields are displayed. The 'utils.py' file contains the 'label_for_field' function, which is where the error is being raised. The 'ModelAdmin' class in 'options.py' has methods related to how the admin interface handles displaying, adding, changing, and deleting objects, all of which could be related to the error if they involve fields like 'choice'.\n\nThe 'label_for_field' function in 'utils.py' tries to find the field with the given name on the model and if it doesn't exist, it tries to find it on the model admin. In the case where the field is not found either on the model or the model admin, an AttributeError is raised. This corresponds directly to the error described in the issue.\n\nThe new search results provided do not contain any additional relevant code spans as they pertain to a 'Choice' class that is not directly related to the 'Question' model or the admin interface functionality described in the issue.
