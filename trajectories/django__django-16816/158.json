The traceback suggests that the error occurs in the 'label_for_field' function in 'django/contrib/admin/utils.py'. This function is responsible for generating labels for fields and handles cases where the field does not exist on the model. The key code spans that are relevant to this issue are the 'label_for_field' function itself, as well as the functions and classes in 'django/contrib/admin/options.py' that define how the admin interacts with models, such as 'BaseModelAdmin' and 'ModelAdmin'. These classes contain settings and methods for defining how model fields are displayed and managed in the admin interface. Notably, the 'ModelAdmin' class has methods like 'get_list_display', 'get_list_display_links', 'get_list_filter', 'get_list_select_related', and 'get_search_fields' which are directly related to configuring how fields are handled in the admin list view and could be potential points of interest for implementing a fix or enhancement. Additionally, the 'Formfield_for_choice_field' method in 'BaseModelAdmin' is worth examining as it deals with handling choice fields, which could be related to the 'choice' field mentioned in the issue. Furthermore, the 'ChoicesFieldListFilter' class in 'django/contrib/admin/filters.py' is also relevant as it deals with filtering by choice fields, which could be indirectly related to the issue if 'choice' were meant to be a filterable field.",

The `label_for_field` function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` is a crucial part of the code that attempts to resolve the field name and handle cases where the field does not exist on the model. The `FieldDoesNotExist` exception is raised if the field is not found. Additionally, the `ModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` is where the 'list_display' configuration for the admin interface is managed. Since the search did not yield direct results for the 'Question' and 'Choice' models, the next step involves reviewing the 'list_display' configuration in the 'QuestionAdmin' class to ensure it correctly references existing fields or methods on the 'Question' model. Given the complexity and depth of the provided context, it is essential to identify the exact location where 'list_display' is defined and verify if 'choice' is properly referenced.",

Through an examination of the current codebase, we see that the 'label_for_field' function in 'django/contrib/admin/utils.py' is responsible for generating labels for fields and handles cases where the field does not exist. The 'AttributeError' raised in this function directly corresponds to the issue reported, indicating that the function attempts to find the field 'choice' on both the model and the model admin. The specific error message, 'Unable to lookup 'choice' on Question or QuestionAdmin', is crucial as it specifies the point of failure. The 'django/contrib/admin/utils.py' file found in the search results contains the exact function 'label_for_field' and the '_get_non_gfk_field' function, which both play crucial roles in the field lookup process, directly relevant to the issue at hand.",
