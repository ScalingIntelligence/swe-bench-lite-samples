Specifically, the ModelAdmin class in django/contrib/admin/options.py defines the list_display attribute and related methods which handle the display logic. Additionally, the ChangeList class in django/contrib/admin/views/main.py is responsible for managing the list view of admin change lists, including handling fields and filters.\n\nTo address the issue, it's important to identify the correct field configuration and ensure that any referenced fields exist in the model. The ModelAdminChecks class in django/contrib/admin/checks.py also provides checks related to list_display, although no specific errors are reported in relation to missing fields in this case.
