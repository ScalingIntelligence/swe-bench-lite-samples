This suggests that the 'choice' field does not exist on the 'Question' model or its admin class. The traceback points to 'django.contrib.admin.utils' and specifically the 'label_for_field' function, which attempts to find the field on the model and raises an error if it cannot. The search results show relevant sections of code from 'django/contrib/admin/options.py', 'django/contrib/admin/utils.py', and others, which include the 'ModelAdmin' class and its methods, as well as the 'label_for_field' function. These are likely places where the error could be addressed. However, the specific section of code where 'list_display' is defined and where the 'choice' field is referenced directly in the 'QuestionAdmin' class is not present in the search results. To fully resolve the issue, it would be necessary to also locate the 'QuestionAdmin' class and ensure that the 'choice' field is correctly defined and handled.",
