The error is due to the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempting to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it preserves the type (the named tuple) and passes an iterator to its constructor, which lacks the necessary code path for copying an iterator. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. To effectively address this issue, we should focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` and potentially the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups.py`.",

The error arises because the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstructs the tuple with the resolved elements. However, this process errors out when dealing with named tuples due to the lack of a code path for handling iterators in their constructor. The fix proposed is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nGiven this, the most relevant code is likely found in the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` class, particularly the method `resolve_lookup_value`. This method contains the logic that handles the resolution of lookup values, including those within tuples. The method checks if the value is a list or tuple and then proceeds to resolve each sub-value independently. This is where the error is occurring, as it does not account for the specific behavior of named tuples.\n\nThe search results indeed contain this method, making it highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
