Specifically, the error occurs during the process of resolving lookup values in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The error type is `TypeError`, indicating that the named tuple's constructor is missing a required positional argument. To address this, the approach is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. Therefore, the search should focus on the `Query` class and the `resolve_lookup_value` method, as well as any named tuple usage in related modules.",

Specifically, the error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class does not handle named tuples correctly when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0. The issue arises when `resolve_lookup_value` tries to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it passes an iterator to the named tuple's constructor, which expects specific positional arguments.\n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code spans are identified in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. The method `resolve_lookup_value` is the main focus here, as it contains the logic that needs to be fixed to ensure named tuples are handled correctly. Additionally, the method `build_filter` is also relevant because it calls `resolve_lookup_value` and constructs filters, which could also be impacted by the named tuple handling.\n\nThe identified code spans include:\n- `Query.resolve_lookup_value`: This method needs to be modified to correctly handle named tuples.\n- `Query.build_filter`: This method is relevant because it uses `resolve_lookup_value` and should be reviewed for any necessary adjustments.\n\nOther parts of the codebase, such as `django/db/models/utils.py` and `django/db/models/query.py`, do not directly relate to the issue at hand and can be considered out of scope for this specific fix.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
