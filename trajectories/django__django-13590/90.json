The error message indicates that the __new__ method of the named tuple is missing a required argument. This is due to the way Django's query resolution mechanism handles named tuples during the upgrade. To address this, the focus should be on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` and how named tuples are processed within this context. Additionally, inspecting the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups` is crucial to understand how the range queryset filters operate and potentially modify the handling of named tuples.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves an error when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0, specifically related to named tuples being used as arguments to the range queryset filters. The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` tries to resolve the tuple elements and then construct a new tuple using the resolved elements. In Django 3.0, this process fails because named tuples cannot be constructed directly from an iterator, leading to a `TypeError`. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the critical section of code is in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class. This method is iterating over the elements of the tuple and attempting to resolve each individually, but it's not handling the reconstruction step appropriately for named tuples. This is the exact part of the codebase that must be modified to ensure that the contents of the iterator, whether they are resolved elements or not, are expanded correctly when constructing the new named tuple.\n\nAdditionally, the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups` is mentioned as part of the filter handling. Although it does not directly contribute to the bug, it is relevant for understanding the context in which the named tuples are being used with range filters. Understanding this part of the code helps to ensure that modifications in `resolve_lookup_value` are compatible with the existing range lookup implementation.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
