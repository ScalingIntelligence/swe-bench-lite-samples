Specifically, the error occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class in `django.db.models.sql.query`. The method iterates over tuple elements and attempts to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements, which fails because the named tuple does not have a constructor that can handle an iterator. The fix involves expanding the iterator contents into the tuple constructor.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, specifically the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is directly involved in the issue, as it handles the resolution of tuple elements and their reconstruction. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is also relevant, as it defines the `range` lookup used in queryset filters.\n\nThe relevant code spans include:\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value` - This method iterates over tuple elements and attempts to reconstruct them.\n2. `Range` class - This class defines the `range` lookup, which is used in the queryset filters.\n3. `Range.get_rhs_op` - This method constructs the SQL operation for the range lookup.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
