            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that during the upgrade from Django 2.2 to 3.0, the use of named tuples as arguments to the range query filter causes a TypeError. This occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute tuples with resolved elements, which fails when it involves named tuples. To fix this, the contents of the iterator should be expanded into the constructor of the tuple.\n\nCurrently, the `resolve_lookup_value` method handles lists and tuples by resolving their sub-values independently and then attempting to return them as the original type. However, this approach does not account for named tuples, which require specific arguments for their construction.\n\nGiven this, the relevant parts of the code to focus on are:\n1. The `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` where the error occurs.\n2. The `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups` where the `range` lookup is defined and might need to be adjusted to handle named tuples differently.\n\nThe provided search results include the necessary context of the `Range` class and its methods, particularly the `get_rhs_op` method, which constructs the SQL condition for the range lookup. While this method does not directly address the issue of named tuples, understanding how the range lookup works can guide the modification required in the `resolve_lookup_value` method to properly handle named tuples.",

The 'Range' class in 'django.db.models.lookups' is also provided, which is likely where the named tuple interacts with the range filter. The provided code seems to cover the necessary parts to understand how named tuples might cause an error in a 3.0 upgrade when passed as arguments to range filters.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
