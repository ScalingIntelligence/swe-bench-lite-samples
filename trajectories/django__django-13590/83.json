The error arises from `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempting to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but failing due to insufficient arguments. The key to solving this issue is to unpack the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. In the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` under the `Query` class, specifically in the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This method iterates over the elements of a tuple and resolves them, but it fails to handle the case where the tuple is a named tuple and should be reconstructed with its original type. The identified code spans provide the necessary context to understand how tuples, including named tuples, are handled during query resolution, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
