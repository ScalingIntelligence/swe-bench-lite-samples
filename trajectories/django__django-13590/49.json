The error stems from the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class of `django.db.models.sql.query`. This method attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple. However, when dealing with named tuples, it fails because the named tuple constructor doesn't handle the iterator correctly. The solution involves expanding the iterator into the constructor. Given the issue description, the relevant code span is the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class.

The method handles the resolution of values, including lists and tuples, by iterating through their elements and resolving them independently. This indicates that the relevant code for addressing the named tuple issue is present in the provided file context. Specifically, the handling of the tuple within the `resolve_lookup_value` method suggests where the fix to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor would need to be applied.
