The problem occurs during the upgrade from Django 2.2 to 3.0, specifically in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class. The error is triggered when the method attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, preserving the type (a named tuple) but passing an iterator to its constructor, which lacks the necessary code path for handling an iterator. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `resolve_lookup_value` method and potentially other parts of the codebase that handle tuples or named tuples in similar contexts. The search results include the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which is likely involved in the range functionality. These sections of code are relevant to the issue as they involve the handling of tuples in the context of queryset filtering.",
