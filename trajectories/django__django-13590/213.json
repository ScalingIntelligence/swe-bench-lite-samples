The error occurs because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value attempts to resolve lookup values by iterating over tuple elements and then tries to construct a new tuple with the resolved elements. This process preserves the type (the named tuple) but passes an iterator to its constructor, causing a TypeError since named tuples don't support constructing from iterators directly. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, I focused on the code spans within the Query class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', especially the resolve_lookup_value method, which directly deals with the handling of tuple-like structures. Additionally, I inspected the NamedValuesListIterable and NamedValuesListIterable.__iter__ spans in 'django/db/models/query.py' to understand how named tuples are currently handled in the Django framework.\n\nGiven the current context and the reported issue, I believe the most relevant code spans to address the issue are within the resolve_lookup_value method of the Query class, which I have selected for detailed analysis and potential modification to accommodate named tuples appropriately.",
