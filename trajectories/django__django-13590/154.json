The error occurs because the 'resolve_lookup_value' method in 'django.db.models.sql.query.Query' iterates over tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstruct the tuple. In Django 3.0, when it tries to construct the new tuple using the resolved elements, it preserves the type (named tuple) but passes an iterator to its constructor, which is not handled correctly by named tuples. The fix is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are:\n- 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', which is where the error occurs.\n- 'Range' in 'django/db/models/lookups.py', as this is the lookup being used with the named tuples.\n\nThese code spans should provide the context needed to understand and resolve the issue related to using named tuples with '__range' in Django 3.0.",
