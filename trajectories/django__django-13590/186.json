Specifically, the error occurs in Django 3.0 when attempting to resolve lookup values in the named tuple, leading to a TypeError due to insufficient arguments passed to the named tuple's constructor. The relevant part of the codebase is within the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, particularly the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is responsible for resolving expressions, including handling tuples and named tuples. The current implementation of `resolve_lookup_value` iterates over the elements of the tuple and resolves each element independently, which is likely where the error occurs when dealing with named tuples. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is relevant as it is the lookup used for range queries and might also need adjustments to handle named tuples correctly.\n\nTo address the issue, the `resolve_lookup_value` method should be modified to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor, ensuring that all required arguments are provided. No existing relevant code has been identified in the file context, so this analysis focuses solely on the provided search results. The identified spans include the `Query` class and specifically the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which are both relevant to the issue.",

The method `resolve_lookup_value` is indeed attempting to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, which aligns with the issue description.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
