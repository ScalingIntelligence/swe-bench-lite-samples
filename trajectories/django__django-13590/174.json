This is crucial for understanding how named tuples might be handled, especially the part where it constructs a new tuple from resolved sub-values. The approach aligns with the problem statement accurately, as it indicates where potential issues could arise when dealing with named tuples. Additionally, the `create_namedtuple_class` function in `django/db/models/utils.py` further supports the analysis with how named tuples are created. This context helps in diagnosing the issue, especially the section in `resolve_lookup_value` that recursively resolves each sub-value, which could be the root cause of the mentioned TypeError. With these insights, the reassessment leads to concluding that the provided file context is indeed relevant and detailed enough to analyze the issue effectively. Therefore, we can proceed with confidence that this is the complete relevant context needed to understand and potentially solve the named tuple issue reported.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
