The error specifically occurs when attempting to reconstitute a named tuple with resolved elements, due to the named tuple's constructor not handling the iterator expansion correctly. This is evidenced by the `TypeError` mentioned in the issue. Analyzing the provided code, particularly the `resolve_lookup_value` method, it's clear that the method iterates over the elements of tuples (which can be named tuples) and attempts to resolve each element independently. The key issue is likely that this resolution process does not correctly handle the construction of named tuples when they are iterated over. To fix this, the contents of the iterator should be expanded into the named tuple's constructor. The relevant code span to address this is the `resolve_lookup_value` method, as it directly deals with the problematic operation on tuples and named tuples.",
