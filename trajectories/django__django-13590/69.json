The error occurs specifically in the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The problem is that this method attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it incorrectly passes an iterator to the named tuple's constructor. To resolve this, the contents of the iterator need to be expanded into the constructor. Therefore, the focus should be on the `Query` class and its `resolve_lookup_value` method, as well as any associated classes or methods that handle tuple resolution or construction.",

The issue stems from the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, which attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstructs the tuple. In Django 3.0, the method fails when trying to construct the new tuple with the resolved elements, particularly when the tuple is a named tuple. This is because named tuples do not support being initialized from an iterator. The fix suggested is to unpack the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code span is `Query.resolve_lookup_value`. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values, including those within tuples. The method currently tries to reconstruct the tuple, which leads to the error when dealing with named tuples. This code span is directly related to the reported issue and contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to handle named tuples correctly.",
