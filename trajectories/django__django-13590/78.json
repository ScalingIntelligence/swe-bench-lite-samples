The issue is rooted in Django's Query class, specifically the resolve_lookup_value method, which performs operations on named tuples and subsequently reconstructs them, potentially using an iterator rather than expanding the contents for the constructor. This behavior can cause errors because named tuples require specific positional arguments and do not support initialization via an iterator.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant parts of the codebase are in the query.py and lookups.py files. In query.py, the Query class, particularly the resolve_lookup_value method, is central as it iterates over the elements of the tuple passed to it and tries to reconstitute the tuple. This could be where the error occurs when named tuples are involved.\n\nIn lookups.py, the Range class handles the 'range' lookup operation, which might also include tuple or named tuple operations, making this another relevant section.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are crucial for addressing the issue since they directly deal with the operations causing the error when working with named tuples.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about a TypeError that occurs when upgrading Django from 2.2 to 3.0, specifically when named tuples are used as arguments to the `__range` filter in querysets. The issue arises because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it passes an iterator to the named tuple's constructor, which lacks the code path for handling iterators and results in insufficient arguments. The fix involves expanding the iterator into the named tuple constructor.\n\nIn the provided file context, the relevant code spans include the `Query` class and its methods `__init__` and `resolve_lookup_value`. The method `resolve_lookup_value` is particularly pertinent as it is responsible for resolving lookup values and handles the specific logic where the issue occurs.\n\nThe new search results confirm the presence of these methods. The `Query.__init__` and `Query.resolve_lookup_value` methods are the same as the ones present in the file context. These methods are critical for understanding how the `Query` object initializes and how it resolves lookup values. The `resolve_lookup_value` method contains the logic where named tuples are processed and reconstructed, making it a central point for addressing the issue.\n\nIn terms of relevance, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` does not directly address the resolution of named tuples but is relevant to understanding the `__range` lookup operation. This provides context for where named tuples might be used in the queryset filtering process. Therefore, it is important to include it for a comprehensive understanding of the affected codebase.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are comprehensive and cover the essential parts of the code related to the reported issue.",
