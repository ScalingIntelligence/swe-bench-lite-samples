The key function to focus on is 'resolve_lookup_value' in django/db/models/sql/query.py, as it involves handling tuples and named tuples. The specific problem arises when the function attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it preserves the type (the named tuple) and passes an iterator to its constructor, which errors due to insufficient arguments. The fix suggests expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. The relevant code spans include the entire 'resolve_lookup_value' function and possibly 'build_filter' as it directly interacts with 'resolve_lookup_value'. Additionally, since the issue relates to handling tuples in lookups, the 'Range' class in django/db/models/lookups.py is likely relevant as it is associated with the 'range' lookup. Also, the 'resolve_callables' function in django/db/models/utils.py may indirectly affect named tuple handling but is less directly relevant compared to the other parts.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
