The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but the named tuple's constructor does not handle the iterator correctly. To address this, the search should focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class and related handling of named tuples or iterators in the context of queryset filters. Additionally, the `Range` lookup class and the `ValuesListIterable` classes should also be considered as potential sources of the issue due to their handling of iterable types.",

The error occurs because the resolve_lookup_value method in django.db.models.sql.query.Query attempts to reconstitute the named tuple with resolved elements but passes an iterator to its constructor, which lacks the necessary code path for handling iterators. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the resolve_lookup_value method of the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values, including handling lists and tuples. The code within this method needs to be adjusted to properly handle named tuples by expanding the iterator contents into the constructor. Additionally, the Range class in django/db/models/lookups.py, which is related to the range lookup, is also relevant as it involves named tuples being used as arguments.\n\nThe identified spans are:\n1. Query.resolve_lookup_value - This method needs to be fixed to handle named tuples correctly.\n2. Range - This class is related to the range lookup and using named tuples as arguments.\n\nThese spans are crucial for addressing the issue, ensuring that named tuples are properly handled when used as arguments to the range function.\n\nOverall, the search results provide the necessary context to understand and fix the reported issue.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
