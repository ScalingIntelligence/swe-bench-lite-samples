This happens due to the difference in how Django 3.0 handles the resolution of lookup values compared to 2.2. Specifically, the error occurs because the named tuple's constructor is being passed an iterator rather than the expected arguments. To resolve this, the iterator's contents should be expanded into the constructor. Relevant files seem to be those handling model queries and lookups, particularly where named tuples or range lookups are involved. Focus should be on the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py and the FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin in django/db/models/lookups.py.",

According to the issue description, the error occurs during the tuple reconstitution in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class within `django.db.models.sql.query.py`. This function attempts to construct a new tuple preserving the type, which leads to insufficient arguments for the named tuple's constructor. As suggested in the issue, the fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the tuple's constructor. Therefore, focusing on the `resolve_lookup_value` method is essential. Additionally, broader context from other spans in the `Query` class or related modules might be necessary to fully understand the interaction affecting named tuples. However, based on the issue's description and the provided search results, the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class is the immediate concern.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
