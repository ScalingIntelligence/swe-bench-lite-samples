The key point is that in Django 3.0, the function `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` incorrectly tries to reconstruct named tuples with an iterator, leading to a TypeError. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor. Given this, the relevant code spans should include the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method where the error occurs, as well as any related code handling named tuples or range lookups. From the search results, the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method directly relates to the issue, as it processes tuples and could be the source of the error when upgrading. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups` (which handles range lookups) might be relevant because the issue could stem from how named tuples are passed to these lookups.",

Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is also relevant as it is involved in the `__range` lookup.
