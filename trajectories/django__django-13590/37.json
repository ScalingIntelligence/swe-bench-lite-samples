Specifically, the error occurs in the Query class within django/db/models/sql/query.py, in the method resolve_lookup_value. This method recursively resolves lookup values and constructs a new tuple with the resolved elements. However, when dealing with named tuples, this new tuple construction fails as the named tuple's constructor does not support being passed an iterator, necessitating the need to unpack the iterator into the constructor. The relevant code spans from the search results include the resolve_lookup_value method, which indicates where the tuple resolution occurs and where the error is triggered. Additionally, the Range class in django/db/models/lookups.py is identified as relevant because it directly relates to the __range function, which is mentioned in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
