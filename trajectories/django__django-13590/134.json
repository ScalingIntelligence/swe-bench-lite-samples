The key is to find where the code attempts to reconstruct the tuple and ensure it supports named tuples correctly.\n\nFrom the search results, the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `Query` class seems highly relevant. This method is responsible for resolving values passed to the query and handles instances where the value is a list or tuple. The code iterates over the elements of the tuple or list and recursively resolves each element. However, it directly returns the new tuple constructed from these elements, which might not support named tuples as expected.\n\nAdditionally, the `Range` class in `lookups.py` is also relevant, as it is specifically dealing with range-based queries, which may be directly impacted by the changes in how tuples are handled. This class seems to construct SQL BETWEEN clauses using tuple values, and understanding how it processes these values can help in fixing the issue for named tuples.\n\nI've also noted that the rest of the methods in the `Query` class, like `as_sql`, `get_external_cols`, and others, provide context on how the query is compiled and executed, which is useful for understanding the broader impact and interactions of the `resolve_lookup_value` method.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
