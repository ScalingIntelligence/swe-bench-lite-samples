Specifically, a TypeError occurs because Django attempts to reconstitute a named tuple with an iterator rather than expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. The key elements in the issue are the use of named tuples as arguments to range queryset filters and the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`. In the provided search results, the `resolve_lookup_value` method is identified, and within it, the handling of tuples and named tuples is relevant. The method checks if a value is an instance of a list or tuple and then attempts to resolve each sub-value separately. This functionality aligns with the issue described because it shows how Django tries to handle tuples (which includes named tuples) by iterating through their elements and trying to resolve them as separate entities. The fix mentioned in the issue, to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor, would be directly addressed by modifying this method. Therefore, the identified code span is crucial for understanding and fixing the issue.",
