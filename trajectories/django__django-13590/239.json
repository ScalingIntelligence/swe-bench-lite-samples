The error occurs because Django attempts to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstructs the tuple with the resolved elements, but it does so using the named tuple's constructor with an iterator, which named tuples do not support. The relevant sections of code are likely in the places where tuples are handled, especially those related to resolving lookups and reconstructing tuples. Focus should be on the 'resolve_lookup_value' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and any related mixins or classes that might handle named tuples or lookups.",

The issue specifically mentions django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value, which we found in the search results. This method is responsible for resolving values and needs to correctly handle named tuples. Additionally, we should also consider the constructor of the Query class for context on how the query is initialized. The search results also include the Lookup class and its methods, which are relevant as they handle lookup operations involving lhs and rhs values. Furthermore, the FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin class and its batch_process_rhs method should be reviewed as they process rhs values in a batch. Lastly, the QuerySet class and its values_list method are relevant for understanding how values lists are handled, which could intersect with named tuples in the context of the issue. The create_namedtuple_class function in utils.py is also relevant as it pertains to the creation of named tuples.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
