Specifically, the error occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The issue arises when Django attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but the named tuple's constructor is passed an iterator instead of individual elements. This causes a `TypeError` because the named tuple does not have a code path for copying an iterator.\n\nTo address this issue, the fix involves expanding the iterator into the constructor. The relevant code spans are those that handle the resolution of lookup values and the construction of named tuples. Specifically, the `resolve_lookup_value` method needs to be inspected, along with any methods that directly or indirectly interact with this method.\n\nFrom the search results, the following spans are relevant:\n- `Query.resolve_lookup_value`: This method directly handles the resolution of values in the query, including the case where the value is a named tuple.\n- `Query.__init__`: Although not directly related to the issue, this method provides context on the initialization of the `Query` class, which can be useful for understanding the broader context of how query objects are created.\n\nThe relevant code spans to address the issue are those within the `resolve_lookup_value` method, especially the part that deals with `list` and `tuple` types. The proposed fix would involve modifying this part to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor when dealing with named tuples.\n\nThe named tuple creation and handling are also crucial. The `create_namedtuple_class` method in `django/db/models/utils.py` is relevant for understanding how named tuples are created, although it does not directly contribute to the error in this specific case. The `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, specifically the `get_rhs_op` method, is also relevant as it deals with the range lookup, which is the context in which named tuples are causing errors.\n\nGiven these considerations, the identified code spans are sufficient to address the reported issue. Further investigation within these spans should lead to a solution that involves expanding the iterator into the constructor when dealing with named tuples in the `resolve_lookup_value` method.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
