The error arises because Django attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple, but this process fails due to the specific handling of named tuples. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor.

The relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` within the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method where the function handles list and tuple elements by resolving them independently. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is inspected as it is related to the `__range` lookup. The identified code spans within `Query.resolve_lookup_value` are critical as they show how the function processes tuple elements, which aligns with the described issue of named tuples not being processed correctly during the upgrade.

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
