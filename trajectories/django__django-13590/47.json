The error arises because the 'resolve_lookup_value' method in the Query class attempts to reconstitute tuples and faces issues when handling named tuples, leading to a TypeError. To resolve this, the iterator's contents need to be properly expanded into the named tuple constructor. This search should focus on the Query class in the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file, and possibly the Range class within 'django/db/models/lookups.py'.",

Two key areas to focus on are the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class within 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and the `Range` class in 'django/db/models/lookups.py'. The examination should concentrate on how tuples, specifically named tuples, are processed and rebuilt within these methods. It's crucial to understand the interplay between these methods, especially when dealing with queryset lookups and filters. The primary task is to ensure that when named tuples are resolved and reassembled within the `resolve_lookup_value` method, they are handled correctly without causing the TypeError related to insufficient arguments. Additionally, understanding how the `Range` lookup interacts with these tuples could provide further insight or potential fixes.",

The error arises because `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` processes tuple elements and attempts to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements, preserving the named tuple type but passing an iterator to its constructor, which named tuples do not support. The fix proposed involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nIn the search results, the key method `resolve_lookup_value` is present within the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This method processes each sub_value in the tuple and attempts to resolve them, which could potentially cause the error when attempting to reconstruct the tuple. Therefore, focusing on this method and its handling of tuples is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the `Range` lookup class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is relevant as it is directly related to the range queryset filters. The `process_rhs` method in this class, which is overridden by the `Range` class and its mixins, is responsible for processing the right-hand side of the lookup. Understanding how iterables are handled here, particularly in the context of constructing SQL statements, is important.\n\nBased on the issue description and current context, identifying and analyzing these specific spans of code should provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential fix.",

The relevant parts of the code to focus on are the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` and the `Range` lookup in `django.db.models.lookups`. The `resolve_lookup_value` method needs to be modified to handle named tuples correctly, ensuring that the contents of the iterator are expanded before constructing the new tuple.
