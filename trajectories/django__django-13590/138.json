The error occurs when attempting to reconstruct tuples, specifically named tuples, after resolving lookups. This results in a `TypeError` due to insufficient arguments being passed to the named tuple constructor.\n\nIn the search results, the `Query` class is identified, which includes the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is responsible for resolving values and constructing new tuples if necessary. The code within `resolve_lookup_value` checks if the value is a list or tuple and then attempts to resolve each sub-value independently. However, it currently does not handle the expansion of the iterator for named tuples correctly, which is what leads to the error mentioned in the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are those within the `resolve_lookup_value` method where the iteration and reconstruction of tuples (including named tuples) are handled.",
