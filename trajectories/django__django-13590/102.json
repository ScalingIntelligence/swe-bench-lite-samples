This works in Django 2.2 but fails in Django 3.0 due to changes in how `resolve_lookup_value` processes and reconstitutes tuples. The error message indicates that the named tuple's constructor is receiving an iterator, which it doesn't handle correctly. To resolve this, we need to find where in the Django codebase the named tuples are being handled and ensure that they are expanded properly into their constructor. Specifically, we should look into the `resolve_lookup_value` method and any related methods that deal with tuple processing in the `Query` class and `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin` class.",

The error occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` iterates over tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements. The key elements to look for are the `resolve_lookup_value` method and the `Range` class in Django's `lookups.py` and `query.py` files. The `resolve_lookup_value` method is responsible for resolving lookup values, including handling tuples and named tuples. The `Range` class is the specific lookup related to the `__range` function in Django's ORM, making both of these critical for addressing the issue. Additionally, any methods or logic that handle tuple or named tuple processing within these classes are pertinent. The search results include the relevant `Range` class and the `resolve_lookup_value` method, but not explicitly how the iterator is handled with named tuples. This suggests that while the current results give context to the problem, they might not yet contain the full solution.",

The presence of the check for `isinstance(value, (list, tuple))` indicates that this method is actively involved in processing iterables, including named tuples.
