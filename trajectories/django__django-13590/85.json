The error occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` tries to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple, but it fails due to insufficient arguments when using a named tuple. The relevant files to investigate are those handling query operations, lookups, and named tuples in Django's model and database handling modules. Specifically, `django/db/models/sql/query.py` seems crucial as it contains the `resolve_lookup_value` method that is directly involved in the error.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
