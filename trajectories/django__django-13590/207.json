The specific issue occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class within `django.db.models.sql.query`. The method iterates over the elements of a tuple and attempts to recreate the tuple with resolved elements. However, this process fails when the tuple is a named tuple, because the named tuple's constructor does not handle being passed an iterator. The solution suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it is clear that the code in question resides in the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is responsible for handling different types of values, including lists and tuples, and resolving their expressions. When it encounters a tuple, it attempts to recreate it with resolved elements, which is where the error occurs for named tuples. The relevant code span is the body of the `resolve_lookup_value` method, specifically the part dealing with tuples.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified relevant code span is in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, within the `resolve_lookup_value` method.",
