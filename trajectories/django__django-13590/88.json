The error message indicates a problem with the '__new__' method of the named tuple class, suggesting that the constructor is receiving the wrong number of arguments. This is likely due to the 'resolve_lookup_value' method in the 'Query' class attempting to construct new tuples with resolved elements but failing to properly handle named tuples. To address this, we need to find the relevant parts of Django's codebase where 'range' queryset filters using named tuples are handled and ensure they properly expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor. Potential key files and methods to investigate include 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' for 'resolve_lookup_value', 'django/db/models/lookups.py' for the 'Range' class, and possibly 'django/utils/datastructures.py' for named tuple handling.",

This method is responsible for resolving the values passed to the filter. Specifically, it becomes apparent that there's an issue when the method goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple. This involves preserving the original type, which can lead to errors due to insufficient arguments. Given this context, the focus would be on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` as well as the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. These two code spans are directly related to the `range` lookup functionality and the handling of query resolution. The analysis of these spans shows that the logic for handling iterables within the resolution process seems pertinent but currently does not include the use of the `*` operator to unpack the iterator, which could be essential for addressing the specific issue with named tuples.",
