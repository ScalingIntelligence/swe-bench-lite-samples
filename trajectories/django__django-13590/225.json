The error occurs during the resolution of lookup values within the Query class, specifically in the method resolve_lookup_value. This method attempts to reconstruct the tuple using resolved elements, which fails for named tuples because they cannot be instantiated with an iterator. The fix suggested involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor for these named tuples.\n\nGiven the context, the relevant code spans are:\n1. The Query class definition and its constructor (__init__) are examined to understand how queries are initialized, though they do not directly handle the tuple resolution.\n2. The resolve_lookup_value method within the Query class is critical as it deals directly with resolving and possibly reconstructing tuples passed as arguments.\n3. The Range class in the lookups.py file, which handles the 'range' lookup, is particularly relevant as it is where the named tuples are likely being used as arguments.\n4. The get_rhs_op method in the Range class is also noted as it constructs the right-hand side operator which might involve these named tuples.\n\nFrom the analysis, the identified spans are 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' in query.py and 'Range' in lookups.py as they directly address the issue of resolving and using named tuples in the context of range queries.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
