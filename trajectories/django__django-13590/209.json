The specific problem occurs in the method `resolve_lookup_value` of the `Query` class, where the function incorrectly attempts to reconstitute the tuple using an iterator, which named tuples do not support. This error is evident in the provided code span for `Query.resolve_lookup_value`. The provided search results include the relevant method where the error occurs. Specifically, the code snippet that handles the resolution of lookup values when they are lists or tuples is the critical part. The code iterates over the elements of the tuple, resolving each independently, but it fails to properly handle the reconstruction of named tuples, leading to the reported error. The fix suggested involves expanding the iterator contents into the constructor, which implies modifying the way tuples are reassembled in this method. Given this analysis, the identified relevant code span is the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method.",
