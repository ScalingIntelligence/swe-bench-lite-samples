The specific problem arises in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, where an attempt to reconstitute a named tuple with an iterator fails due to missing positional arguments. The fix involves expanding the iterator into the named tuple constructor.\n\nThe provided `search_results` contain several relevant sections in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. Notably, spans `Query.resolve_lookup_value` and `Query.build_lookup` are pertinent as they deal with resolving and building lookups, which directly involve handling named tuples and iterators.\n\nIn addition, the `django/db/models/lookups.py` file contains spans like `Lookup.process_rhs` and `Exact.process_rhs`, which are essential for processing the right-hand side of lookups, possibly involving named tuples. These sections should be reviewed for potential fixes or modifications.\n\nOverall, the identified spans in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/lookups.py` are critical for addressing the issue, particularly those dealing with resolving and processing lookups.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
