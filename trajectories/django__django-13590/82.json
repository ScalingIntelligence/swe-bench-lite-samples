Focusing on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `Range` lookup class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is a good starting point.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about an upgrade from Django 2.2 to 3.0 causing errors when named tuples are used as arguments to range queryset filters. The error is due to the way django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value processes these tuples. Specifically, the method tries to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements but fails because named tuples don't support construction from iterators directly. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nFrom the search results, two key parts of the code are relevant:\n\n1. The `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is where the error occurs. This method attempts to resolve each element of the tuple and then reconstructs it. The current implementation uses type(value) to construct the new tuple, which is correct as per standard tuples, but fails for named tuples.\n\n2. The `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which is used for `range` lookups, shows how the range lookup is defined and works. This is also relevant context as the issue directly affects the use of range lookups with named tuples.\n\nThe critical part for fixing the issue lies in modifying the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method to handle named tuples correctly by expanding the iterator into the constructor.",
