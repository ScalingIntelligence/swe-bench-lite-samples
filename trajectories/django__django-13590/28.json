The issue arises due to the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The method attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple, but it fails due to the named tuple's constructor not handling iterators properly. To find the specific code causing this issue, we need to focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method and the handling of tuples in the `Range` lookup class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. Additionally, we should also look at the `values_list` method in `django/db/models/query.py` as it might play a role in how tuples are processed.",

The key problem lies in the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, which attempts to reconstitute tuples with resolved elements. This process causes a `TypeError` if the iterator's contents are not correctly expanded into the constructor of the named tuple. The identified relevant code includes the initial definition of the `Query` class and its `__init__` method, which sets up the initial state of the query. The critical part is the `resolve_lookup_value` method within this class that handles the resolution of lookup values, including tuples. The method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle named tuples. Additionally, I examined the `QuerySet` class and its `values_list` method to ensure that the handling of values lists is robust against the changes. Finally, checking the `Range` class under `lookups.py` was essential to understand how the range filter operates and ensures its compatibility with tuples, including named tuples.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
