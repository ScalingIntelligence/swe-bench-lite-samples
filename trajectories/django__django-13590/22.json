The error occurs during the resolution of lookup values, specifically in the Query.resolve_lookup_value method, where it is failing to properly reconstruct the named tuple due to missing positional arguments. The identified code span 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' appears to be directly related to the issue as it is responsible for processing and resolving these lookup values. The method processes values, including lists and tuples, and attempts to resolve each sub-value independently. The problem described aligns with the code's handling of tuples where it tries to recreate them without handling the special case of named tuples correctly. This is likely where the fix would be applied to ensure the code can correctly handle and reconstruct named tuples within the lookup resolution process. The search results also include the 'Range' class which is relevant as it is the lookup being used and affected by this issue, suggesting further that this code is directly connected to the problem.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
