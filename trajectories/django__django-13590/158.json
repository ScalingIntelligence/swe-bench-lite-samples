The error occurs due to the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempting to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements. This leads to a TypeError because the named tuple's constructor expects specific positional arguments, but an iterator is passed instead.\n\nThe key section of code to focus on is `Query.resolve_lookup_value` which is responsible for resolving values, including handling tuples. The current implementation of this method does not account for the specific requirements of named tuples when reconstructing them.\n\nTo fix the issue, the method should be modified to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor. This involves recognizing when a value is a tuple and then handling it appropriately by expanding its contents.\n\nThe search results indicate that `Query.resolve_lookup_value` exists in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, and this method is indeed where the problem originates. Therefore, this span of code is highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
