The error arises because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` tries to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstructs the tuple with resolved elements, which fails due to the named tuple's constructor not accepting an iterator directly. To fix this, the iterator's contents should be expanded into the named tuple's constructor. The relevant files and methods to investigate are `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value`, `django.db.models.query.QuerySet.values_list`, and possibly `django.db.models.lookups.Range` and its mixins.",

The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple with the resolved elements. However, when constructing the new tuple, it preserves the type (the named tuple) but passes an iterator to its constructor, causing a `TypeError` due to insufficient arguments.\n\nTo address this issue, the solution involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are:\n\n1. The `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which is the method that needs to be fixed to handle named tuples properly.\n\n2. The `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which is the class that uses the `__range` function and will need to be adjusted to handle the new changes in `resolve_lookup_value`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans are crucial for addressing the compatibility issue during the upgrade process.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
