The error arises because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempts to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements, but the type is preserved as a named tuple, which lacks the proper constructor for handling iterators. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. To identify the relevant code, it's crucial to focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` and the `Range` lookup class in `django.db.models.lookups`.",
