The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it incorrectly passes an iterator to the named tuple's constructor. This mismatch in handling named tuples leads to the error. The search should focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method and its interaction with named tuples. Additionally, the `Range` lookup class in `django.db.models.lookups` might be involved in processing these tuples. Given the complexity of the issue, multiple searches are needed to cover potential areas of concern.",

This error occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but it preserves the type (the named tuple) and passes an iterator to its constructor, which fails since named tuples don't handle this scenario. The fix is to explicitly expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. Because the issue involves `resolve_lookup_value` and primarily manifests in the `__range` lookup, the relevant code spans should include those that handle `resolve_lookup_value` and the `Range` lookup in the `django.db.models.sql.query` and `django.db.models.lookups` modules, respectively. The identified spans in `query.py` are crucial for understanding how lookups are resolved and processed, especially when they involve named tuples or other iterable types. The spans in `lookups.py` are also important as they define how the `__range` lookup functionality works, which is central to the issue being reported.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
