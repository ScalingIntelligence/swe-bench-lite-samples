The error occurs because Django's SQL query resolution mechanism tries to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple. Since the named tuple does not have a constructor path to copy an iterator, it results in a TypeError due to missing positional arguments. To address this, we need to focus on the part of the code that handles the resolution of named tuples in the query process. Files related to the SQL query processing, specifically those dealing with the resolution of lookup values and the handling of named tuples, should be of primary interest. Specifically, the resolve_lookup_value method in the Query class within django/db/models/sql/query.py and any related methods handling tuple resolution should be examined.",

The error occurs because the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but fails due to the named tuple's constructor not handling iterators correctly. The relevant code span to focus on is the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values, including iterables like named tuples. When it encounters a tuple, it tries to reconstruct it using the type of the original tuple, which leads to the error if the tuple is a named tuple. The fix suggested is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor, which implies modifying how the tuple is reconstructed within `resolve_lookup_value` to accommodate named tuples. The provided search results include the `resolve_lookup_value` method as part of the `Query` class, making it clear that this method is directly involved in the issue's root cause.",
