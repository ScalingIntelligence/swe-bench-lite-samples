The error occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` processes tuple elements and attempts to reassemble the tuple with resolved elements. However, named tuples do not handle this transformation correctly due to the absence of appropriate constructor logic for handling iterators. To address this, the search should focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method and related components handling tuple processing and named tuples in the `django.db.models.sql.query` module. Additionally, examining how `Range` and `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin` handle these tuples might be pertinent.",

The error occurs when named tuples are used as arguments to the `__range` filter in a queryset, causing a `TypeError`. This error results from the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, attempting to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements but mistakenly preserving the type (named tuple) and passing an iterator to its constructor. Named tuples lack a constructor that accepts an iterator, leading to the error. The solution involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class. The method should be modified to expand the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple, ensuring it is properly reconstructed. Relevant code spans for this modification are within the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method and possibly the `Range` class, where the `__range` filter logic resides.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are:\n- `Query.resolve_lookup_value` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` which handles the resolution and reconstruction of values.\n- `Range.get_rhs_op` in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, though not directly related to the error but is part of the logic handling the `__range` filter and could be relevant for understanding the context of the issue.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
