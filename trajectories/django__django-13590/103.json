The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements. The specific error is due to named tuples not having the code path for copying an iterator. To resolve this, we need to identify where the `resolve_lookup_value` method is defined and where it's used, specifically when dealing with named tuples and their incorporation into range queryset filters. Additionally, investigating the `Range` lookup class in `django.db.models.lookups` is necessary to understand how named tuples are being processed in the context of range queryset filters.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
