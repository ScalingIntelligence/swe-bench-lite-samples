The error arises due to the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, where the method attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but fails due to the named tuple's constructor not handling iterators correctly.\n\nThe provided search results include several relevant spans from the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. Of particular interest is the span `Query.resolve_lookup_value`, which directly involves the handling of values and their resolution, including the handling of tuples. This span contains the logic where the tuple elements are resolved and then attempted to be reconstituted. The code currently constructs a new tuple using `type(value)(...)`, which aligns with the issue's description that the named tuple's constructor does not handle this iterator expansion correctly. This span is pivotal for addressing the reported issue because it is where the named tuple construction error occurs.\n\nConsidering the identified spans, the main focus should be on `Query.resolve_lookup_value` as it directly addresses the problematic code segment. Other spans, while relevant, do not directly address the issue of named tuples and their handling in the same way.\n\nBased on the analysis, the crucial span is `Query.resolve_lookup_value`, which needs to be modified to properly handle named tuples by expanding the iterator contents into the constructor, addressing the TypeError that occurs in Django 3.0.",
