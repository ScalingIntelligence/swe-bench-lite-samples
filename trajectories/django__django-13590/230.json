The error occurs because the method django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value attempts to reconstruct the tuple after resolving lookups, which fails when the tuple is a named tuple due to the lack of support for constructing a named tuple from an iterator.\n\nThe relevant code spans to address this issue can be found in the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file, specifically in the 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' method. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values and, in the case of tuples, iterates over the elements to resolve them individually. The critical part is where it attempts to recreate the tuple with the resolved elements, which needs to be adjusted to account for named tuples.\n\nTo fix this, the method should be updated to unpack the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple, ensuring that the required positional arguments are correctly passed. This change should prevent the TypeError reported in the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the 'django/db/models/lookups.py' file contains the 'Range' class, which is relevant to the range filter functionality. Although the issue does not directly involve changes to this class, it is important context for understanding how the range filter operates.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans are in the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file, focusing on the 'resolve_lookup_value' method. This method needs to be modified to handle named tuples appropriately by expanding the iterator into the constructor.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
