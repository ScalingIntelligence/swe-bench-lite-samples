The error occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`. This method attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and reconstruct the tuple, but it fails because the named tuple constructor is not designed to handle an iterator. The required fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor. To locate the root cause and potential fixes, I will search for the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` and also look into the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups` to understand how named tuples are being handled in range filters.",

Specifically, the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `query.py` is likely where the issue originates, as it attempts to resolve and reconstruct tuples.

Both of these code spans should be reviewed for potential fixes to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
