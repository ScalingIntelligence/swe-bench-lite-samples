To resolve this, the contents of the iterator should be expanded into the named tuple's constructor. Given the description, the relevant parts of the codebase are likely in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, `django/db/models/lookups.py`, and potentially `django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py`.

The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans include:\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which is the core method that iterates over tuple elements to resolve lookups. This method should be adjusted to correctly handle named tuples by expanding the iterator contents.\n2. The `Range` class and its `get_rhs_op` method in `django/db/models/lookups.py` involve handling the `__range` lookups, which could interact with the `resolve_lookup_value` method. However, the primary issue does not appear to be in the `Range` class directly but in the iterator handling where named tuples are involved.\n\nBased on the analysis, the focus should be on modifying the `resolve_lookup_value` method to properly handle named tuples by expanding their elements, ensuring the fix aligns with the described issue.",

The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, which causes issues with named tuples. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nThe current file context shows the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db/models/sql/query.py`, which is the core part of the issue. However, there isn't any direct handling of named tuples or specific fixes related to named tuples.\n\nIn the new search results, the `django/db/models/lookups.py` file contains several classes and methods, including `Lookup`, `BuiltinLookup`, and `Range`. These classes handle various types of lookups, including the `range` lookup. The `Range` class is of particular interest as it directly relates to the `range` queryset filter mentioned in the issue. However, there isn't any specific code that addresses the named tuple issue directly in these search results either.\n\nGiven the context and the new search results, the identified spans relevant to the issue are those related to the `range` lookup, as they are the most closely related to the named tuple issue described.",
