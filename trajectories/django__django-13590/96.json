The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple. However, this process fails when the tuple is a named tuple, as named tuples require explicit arguments, leading to a `TypeError`. This error specifically occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method when it tries to iterate over the tuple contents without expanding them correctly. The fix suggested involves expanding the iterator's contents into the named tuple's constructor.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans include the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which is where the error originates. Additionally, the `Range` class and its methods in `django/db/models/lookups.py` are relevant as they are involved in handling the range queryset filters, which are part of the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
