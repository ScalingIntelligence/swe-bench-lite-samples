The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but it fails to handle named tuples correctly, leading to a `TypeError`. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nFrom the provided search results, I can see that the relevant code spans that are likely to be involved in this issue are:\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value` which is responsible for resolving lookup values and handling tuples.\n2. The `Range` class in `lookups.py`, which is likely to be involved in the range queryset filters that the named tuples are being used for.\n\nWhile the `Range` class does not directly handle named tuples, it's a necessary part of the puzzle for understanding how range filters are being used in the Django queryset. The `resolve_lookup_value` method is critical because it deals with resolving lookup values, including those that could potentially be named tuples, and it's currently where the error originates.\n\nI will identify these two spans as relevant to the reported issue.",

The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `Query` class attempts to iterate over tuple elements and reconstruct the tuple, but fails when it tries to construct a new tuple of the same type (a named tuple) by passing an iterator to its constructor. The fix suggested is to unpack the iterator's contents into the constructor. After examining the code, it's clear that the problematic method is `resolve_lookup_value` in the `Query` class within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The new search results confirm the presence of this method and add more context around related methods like `rewrite_cols` and `build_lookup` which might also be relevant due to their relation to handling expressions and lookups. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is related because it's specifically where the 'range' lookup is defined. These methods and classes are crucial for understanding and fixing the issue related to named tuples and the range filter in Django 3.0.",

The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. The relevant parts of the code to look at are where named tuples are handled in the resolve_lookup_value method and how tuples are reconstituted after processing. In the file context, the resolve_lookup_value method is already identified as significant. In the search results, the same method in 'Query' is further analyzed, especially focusing on how it handles lists and tuples. Additionally, the 'Range' class lookup in 'lookup.py' is relevant because it defines the 'range' lookup used in the filter, and how it handles iterable RHS values in the 'get_rhs_op' method.",

The `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class partially addresses handling tuples, but it does not appear to handle named tuples specifically. In the `Range` lookup class, it's evident that the class extends `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin`, indicating it's prepared to manage iterable values, but there isn't specific handling for named tuples. This gap could be the cause of the TypeError when using named tuples with the `Range` lookup in Django 3.0. To address this issue, further investigation is needed to enhance the handling of named tuples in both the `resolve_lookup_value` method and the `Range` lookup class.",
