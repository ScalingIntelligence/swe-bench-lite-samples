The error occurs in Django 3.0 due to the way `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` processes tuples and attempts to reconstruct them. Specifically, the issue is that the method does not handle the named tuple's constructor correctly, leading to a `TypeError` due to missing positional arguments. The fix suggested involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor. Based on this, the relevant part of the code to focus on is the `resolve_lookup_value` method. Additionally, since the issue is about the `range` queryset filter, the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups.py` might also be relevant, especially its `get_rhs_op` method.",

This is directly related to the error described where the named tuple is not reconstructed correctly due to an iterator issue. Additionally, the `Range` class in `lookups.py` is related to the `range` query lookups, which can potentially handle or trigger the named tuple issue. Given the provided context, it appears that the necessary code areas to address the named tuple problem are covered, even though the actual fix implementation (expanding the iterator's contents) is not detailed.

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
