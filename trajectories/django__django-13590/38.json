            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the use of named tuples as arguments to range queryset filters in Django, which leads to a TypeError when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0. The root cause identified is that the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to construct a new tuple with resolved elements but fails due to the named tuple's constructor not being designed to handle an iterator input. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, two files are relevant: `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/utils.py`. The `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file contains the `Query` class with the `resolve_lookup_value` method, which is directly related to the error described. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values and reconstructing tuples, thus making it the primary focus for addressing the issue. The `django/db/models/utils.py` file is relevant for understanding the creation of named tuples, though it does not directly contain the code throwing the error. Therefore, the span related to the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is identified as the most relevant code span that needs to be addressed in the fix.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant files and spans should be noted, and the attention should be directed towards modifying the `resolve_lookup_value` method to properly handle the expansion of iterable contents into the named tuple constructor to prevent the TypeError.",
