            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to a TypeError encountered when upgrading Django from version 2.2 to 3.0, specifically when using named tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. The error arises because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value method recursively resolves elements of the tuple and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple using the resolved elements, preserving the named tuple type. However, named tuples expect a specific number of arguments, and passing an iterator to their constructor leads to the error. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided code, the relevant function appears to be 'resolve_lookup_value'. This function includes logic to recursively resolve elements of tuples, which aligns with the issue description. The code correctly identifies that if the value is a list or tuple, it should resolve each sub-value independently. However, it does not account for the specific requirements of named tuples, which expect individual arguments rather than an iterator. This explains why the error occurs in Django 3.0 but not in 2.2.\n\nThe function 'build_filter' also appears relevant as it involves resolving lookup values, which is a key part of the query construction process. However, the issue specific to named tuples and their construction would need to be addressed in 'resolve_lookup_value'.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are sufficient to understand the issue and propose a fix.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
