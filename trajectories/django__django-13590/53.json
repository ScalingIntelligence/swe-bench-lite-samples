The issue described might be due to how named tuples are being handled here, particularly when the method tries to reconstruct them. There's a need to ensure that when a named tuple is encountered, it's correctly reinstantiated. Additionally, the method should be checked for any specific handling or requirements introduced in Django 3.0 for named tuples.",

The issue arises when named tuples are used as arguments to `__range`, causing a `TypeError`. This error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class attempts to reconstruct tuples using the resolved elements. If the original value is a named tuple, it tries to pass an iterator to the constructor, which is not supported by named tuples and leads to the error.\n\nIn the `file_context`, the relevant method `resolve_lookup_value` is already identified. The method checks if the value has a `resolve_expression` method, and if not, it treats it as a list or tuple. It then reconstructs the value using the type of the original value, but without expanding the iterator contents, which is the cause of the problem for named tuples.\n\nReviewing the `search_results`, there are two code spans that are relevant: the `Query` class definition and the `resolve_lookup_value` method. These are the same as in the `file_context`, confirming that the issue is accurately represented. The key part is the `resolve_lookup_value` method, where the fix needs to be applied.\n\nThe fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple, which can be done by unpacking the iterator with the `*` operator. This change ensures that the named tuple constructor receives the correct number of arguments, resolving the `TypeError`.",
