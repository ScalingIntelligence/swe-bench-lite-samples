This method is responsible for resolving different types of values, including named tuples, and it attempts to reconstruct the tuple with the resolved elements. However, named tuples do not have the same initialization code path as regular tuples, causing a `TypeError` when they are reconstructed with an iterator.\n\nIn the provided search results, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains the `resolve_lookup_value` method, which is the main focus of the issue. The method checks if a value is a list or tuple and then processes its items individually. This is the exact point where the named tuple issue arises because the method uses the named tuple's type constructor with an iterator, which fails.\n\nAdditionally, the search results include other methods within the `Query` class that handle various query-building and resolving operations, but they are not directly related to the named tuple issue. The `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is also included in the results, but it does not directly relate to the named tuple issue either.\n\nGiven the context, the key relevant code span is the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class, as it directly deals with the named tuple handling, which is causing the error.\n\nTo fix the issue, it is necessary to modify the `resolve_lookup_value` method to expand the iterator contents into the constructor of named tuples to avoid the `TypeError`.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
