The error specifically occurs when Django attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, preserving the named tuple type but passing an iterator to its constructor, which named tuples do not support.

The key issue is that the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple. However, due to the specific handling of named tuples, it fails when trying to pass an iterator to the constructor of the named tuple, causing a `TypeError`. To address this problem, the solution involves modifying the `resolve_lookup_value` method to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, we can identify the relevant method `resolve_lookup_value` and the specific line in the code where it handles the case of lists or tuples. Here, the method iterates over each item within the tuple or list to resolve lookups independently. This is the point where the named tuple handling fails, and thus, this method requires modification to support named tuples correctly.",
