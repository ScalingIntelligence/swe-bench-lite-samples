The specific error occurs in Django 3.0 when attempting to resolve lookup values within named tuples, which leads to a `TypeError` due to insufficient arguments when trying to reconstitute the tuple. The error points to a problem in how the tuple is being restructured after resolving its elements. This suggests investigating the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` and related methods that handle tuple resolution and construction, such as those in `django.db.models.utils` for named tuple creation and handling. Additionally, methods in `django.db.models.query` related to iterable handling and tuple processing could be relevant.",

The fix involves expanding the iterator into the constructor.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant sections are found in django/db/models/sql/query.py. The most pertinent is the span id='Query.resolve_lookup_value', which directly addresses the function responsible for resolving lookup values. This function iterates over the elements of the tuple and resolves each element, which is likely where the issue arises when trying to reconstitute the tuple.\n\nThe other spans in query.py provide context around how the Query class handles various aspects, but they do not directly address the issue at hand. The spans in other files, such as django/db/models/utils.py and django/db/models/query.py, offer general utility functions and query handling mechanisms but are not directly related to the specific error described.\n\nGiven the context and the problem description, the identified span 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' is critical as it is the point where the error is likely occurring.

Further investigation should focus on how the resolved elements are used in tuple reconstruction and specifically if the named tuple constructor is being called correctly. It's also important to verify how iterators are handled when reconstructing tuples to ensure they are correctly expanded. Given the nature of the error 'TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'', it suggests a mismatch between the expected number of arguments for the named tuple constructor and the actual number provided during tuple reconstruction.

The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements but doesn't handle the named tuple case correctly. The fix suggested involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. From the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are in `Query.resolve_lookup_value` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `NamedValuesListIterable.__iter__` method in `django/db/models/query.py`, as these are directly involved in handling named tuples within the query context and the iteration process. Additionally, the `create_namedtuple_class` function in `django/db/models/utils.py` is related to creating named tuples which could be relevant for a more comprehensive understanding or potential modifications.

This is occurring in Django's `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method where it iterates over tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstruct the tuple. The named tuples do not have a code path for handling the iterator correctly, leading to the error. The provided search results include several relevant sections, particularly the `Query` class and its methods in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` as well as the `NamedValuesListIterable` class in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `create_namedtuple_class` function in `django/db/models/utils.py`. These sections are central to the issue since they deal with resolving lookup values, iterating over results, and creating named tuples. To address the issue, modifications should be made to `Query.resolve_lookup_value` to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor, ensuring that the named tuple is correctly instantiated. Additionally, review is needed in `NamedValuesListIterable` to ensure that it properly handles named tuples during iteration.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
