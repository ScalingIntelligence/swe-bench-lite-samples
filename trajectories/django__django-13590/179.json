In this method, when a named tuple is encountered, it attempts to resolve the lookup values and then reconstruct the tuple. The error arises because the named tuple's constructor expects specific parameters, which are not met when it receives an iterator. To fix this, we need to ensure that the elements of the iterator are expanded into the named tuple's constructor.\n\nIn the search results, the `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` and its methods might also be relevant. It deals with processing right-hand-side values for lookups and resolving expression parameters, which could be related to how tuples (or named tuples) are handled during query processing.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
