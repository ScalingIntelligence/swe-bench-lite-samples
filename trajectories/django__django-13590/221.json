The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, which does not support the named tuple's constructor. To address this, we need to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor. The relevant files and methods to investigate include `django/db/models/sql/query.py` for `resolve_lookup_value`, `django/db/models/lookups.py` for `Range`, and potentially `django/db/models/query.py` for `ValuesListIterable`.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about upgrading a project from Django 2.2 to 3.0, where passing named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters causes errors due to the way Django handles tuple elements. Specifically, the error occurs in the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method when attempting to construct a new tuple with resolved elements. The fix suggested involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. From the provided search results, the relevant section of code is where Django resolves lookup values and handles iterables. The method `resolve_lookup_value` is the key focus as it contains the logic that deals with checking the type of values, including whether they are lists or tuples. This method needs to be examined and potentially modified to ensure that when reconstructing tuples, it should handle the named tuple correctly by expanding the iterator contents. The provided search results did not directly display the problematic code snippet, but the 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' span indicates where the issue is likely located. To fully address the issue, one assumption I made is that the problematic code snippet in `resolve_lookup_value` was not included entirely in the provided search results. This is consistent with the requirement of not isolated spans and reviewing entire sections of code to determine relevance and completeness. I identified the relevant file (django/db/models/sql/query.py) and the specific span id ('Query.resolve_lookup_value') where the change should be made to ensure that named tuples are correctly handled. However, it's important to note that due to the incomplete code snippet, it was inferred that the issue most likely resides within the parameters handling part of the mentioned method, usually near the tuple reconstruction where it might attempt to directly use an iterator without expanding its contents, which is inferred as being required from the issue's description. Thus, after analyzing the search results, even though the exact problematic code is not entirely visible, based on the reported issue and the described problem, I can confidently recommend examining and adjusting the specified method. The missing snippet, where the issue lies but is not present, indicates the need to locate it through further search or by direct examination of the Django source code to implement the necessary fixes accurately.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
