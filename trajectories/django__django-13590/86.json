To address this, we need to focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method and the `Range` lookup class in Django's model lookup system. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the named tuple handling in the queryset filtering logic is correctly implemented.",

The main problem occurs in the 'resolve_lookup_value' method in 'django.db.models.sql.query.Query', where the method attempts to reconstitute tuples with resolved elements. This process fails when handling named tuples due to the requirement for additional positional arguments. The relevance of the 'resolve_lookup_value' method indicates that this segment of code is directly involved in the error scenario described. Additionally, the 'Range' class in 'django.db.models.lookups' is also relevant as it pertains to the 'range' lookup, which is where named tuples are being used as arguments. Therefore, both the 'resolve_lookup_value' method and the 'Range' class need to be examined and potentially modified to handle named tuples appropriately.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
