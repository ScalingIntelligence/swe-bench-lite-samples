This issue is specific to how tuples are handled in the 'resolve_lookup_value' method within the django.db.models.sql.query.Query class. The error occurs when the method attempts to reconstitute a tuple using the named tuple's constructor but sends an iterator, which fails due to insufficient arguments. To locate the exact spot in the code where this error happens, I need to focus on the 'resolve_lookup_value' method and the handling of tuples in range checks.

The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nIn the provided search results, we need to identify the relevant sections of code that deal with resolving lookup values and constructing tuples. The `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method is a key part of the process as it processes tuples and potentially named tuples. This method needs to handle the case where the value is a tuple (or named tuple) and ensure that each element of the tuple is resolved correctly before reconstructing the tuple.\n\nBased on the search results, the relevant code spans appear to be within the `Query` class, specifically the `__init__`, `resolve_lookup_value`, and `build_filter` methods. These methods together handle the initialization of the query, the resolution of lookup values, and the construction of filters, which could include named tuples as values.

This method handles the resolution of values passed to it, including iterables like lists and tuples. If the value is a list or tuple, it iterates over each item to resolve them individually and then recreates the tuple or named tuple using its original type. This process is identified as the source of the error for named tuples when an iterator is passed to the constructor. The issue and the location in the code are accurately identified, suggesting that there is no more relevant file context needed for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
