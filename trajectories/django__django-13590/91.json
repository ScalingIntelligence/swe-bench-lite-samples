The error occurs because the method `resolve_lookup_value` in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, preserving the type (the named tuple) but passing an iterator to its constructor. This causes an error because named tuples do not have a code path for copying an iterator, and thus they error on insufficient arguments. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nThe search results contain several relevant files and methods. In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, there is the `Query` class with its `resolve_lookup_value` method that explicitly handles instances of lists and tuples. This method is likely where the named tuples are being processed and potentially where the error occurs. The method uses type(value) to recreate the tuple, which could be problematic if the type is a named tuple expecting specific field names.\n\nThe file `django/db/models/lookups.py` contains the `Range` class, which is related to the `range` lookup used in queryset filters. This class's `get_rhs_op` method deals with constructing the SQL for range queries, which could be where the named tuple is used directly or indirectly.\n\nBased on the issue description and the provided code spans, the identified spans are from the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class and the `Range` class in `lookups.py`.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
