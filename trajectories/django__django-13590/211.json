This problem specifically surfaces in the context of the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` method, which attempts to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple. The error indicates that the named tuple's constructor is receiving an iterator, which it cannot handle, causing a `TypeError`. To address this, the contents of the iterator need to be expanded into the named tuple's constructor. The relevant files identified from the context provide insights into the code structure and methods involved in handling these operations. Specifically, the `query.py`, `lookups.py`, and `fields/related_lookups.py` are primary suspects due to their involvement in query resolution and lookup handling.",

The root cause identified is that `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` processes tuple elements and attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but fails when the tuple is a named tuple. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the relevant code span appears to be in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, specifically the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values and handles lists and tuples by iterating over their elements and resolving each element independently. The method then attempts to return the elements using the original tuple's type, which can cause issues with named tuples because it tries to pass an iterator to the named tuple's constructor.\n\nTo address the issue, the `resolve_lookup_value` method should be modified to handle named tuples specifically, ensuring that the elements of the iterator are expanded into the named tuple's constructor. This change would prevent the error by properly constructing the named tuple with the resolved elements.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
