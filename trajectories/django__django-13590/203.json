The error message indicates that the named tuple constructor is missing a required positional argument. This occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to resolve lookup values within the tuple and then reconstitute the tuple. The failure arises from trying to construct the new tuple with an iterator instead of expanding its contents. To address this, we need to search for the `resolve_lookup_value` method and the `Range` class to understand how iterator handling has changed between versions and apply the fix of expanding the iterator's contents into the constructor.",

The error occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` when attempting to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements and preserving the named tuple type, but passing an iterator to its constructor. The named tuple then errors due to insufficient arguments.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it's evident that the issue lies within the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The method handles the resolution of lookup values, including lists and tuples, where it tries to resolve each item independently, which is the critical point where the error occurs. While the rest of the methods in `Query` are related to various aspects of query construction and execution, none directly address the issue concerning named tuples and their improper reconstruction.\n\nAlso, a relevant class named `Range` is found in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. However, it doesn't seem directly linked to the reported issue since its functionality pertains to database query range operations, which isn't the root cause of the problem described.\n\nThe solution suggested in the issue description involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor.

The current context shows that `resolve_lookup_value` in `Query` class attempts to resolve elements within a tuple and then construct a new tuple with the resolved elements. The identified problem arises because the named tuple's constructor is not designed to handle an iterator, leading to the error. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nIn the provided search results, the focus should be on `Range` class which is relevant to the `__range` functionality. The `Range` class is found in the `django/db/models/lookups.py` file. Notably, the `Range` class uses `get_rhs_op` method which constructs the range query. Given the context of the issue and the suggested fix, it is logical to check if the code in the `Range` class correctly handles the named tuples or iterators appropriately.\n\nTo address the issue, it is necessary to ensure that when `resolve_lookup_value` constructs a tuple from an iterator, it uses the correct form of the constructor, possibly by unpacking the iterator into the tuple constructor if it corresponds to a named tuple. Therefore, the relevant code spans from the search results would be those that define or use the `Range` class or its methods within `['Range', 'Range.get_rhs_op']`.",

In `query.py`, the `resolve_lookup_value` method is responsible for resolving lookup values, which includes handling lists and tuples recursively. This behavior seems relevant to the error experienced, as named tuples might not be handled appropriately when they are resolved and then reconstructed. In `lookups.py`, the `Range` class is defined with the `lookup_name` of 'range', extending from `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin` and `BuiltinLookup`. The class method `get_rhs_op` constructs a SQL range condition using the right-hand side values provided. The current handling of iterables in `resolve_lookup_value` might not account for named tuples correctly, leading to the inability to reconstruct them with the expected arguments. Comparing this implementation with Django 2.2 could reveal specific changes that need adjustment for compatibility with named tuples structures.",

Specifically, when Django attempts to resolve lookup values within named tuples, it doesn't handle the reconstitution of these tuples correctly, leading to errors. The current file context includes the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method, which is responsible for resolving lookup values and is where the issue likely occurs. The new search results provide additional context for the `Query` class, specifically the methods involved in resolving expressions and lookups. Given the issue description, the most relevant method remains `resolve_lookup_value`, as it directly deals with the type of value that causes the error (named tuples). The additional methods in the search results, such as `rewrite_cols`, `combine`, `deferred_to_data`, etc., while important for the query process, do not directly address the named tuple error described. Therefore, the focus should stay on the `resolve_lookup_value` method for identifying and potentially fixing the issue.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
