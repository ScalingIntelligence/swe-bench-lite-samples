            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves named tuples being used as arguments to `__range`, causing errors in Django 3.0. The error occurs specifically in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class, which attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and later reconstitutes the tuple with resolved elements. However, the reconstruction process fails due to the named tuple's constructor not being able to handle an iterator directly. This issue is not present in Django 2.2 and is crucial to address.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to identify and extract the relevant code spans that handle the named tuple transformation in the `resolve_lookup_value` method. Additionally, we should review the `Range` class and its associated methods since it is directly involved with the `__range` functionality.\n\nFrom the provided search results, relevant code spans include:\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value`: This method is directly involved in resolving the lookup values and needs to be adjusted to handle named tuples correctly.\n2. `Range.get_rhs_op`: This method is part of the `Range` class which handles the range functionality. Although it does not directly address the named tuple issue, it is relevant to the overall context of the issue.\n\nThe problem requires a fix in the `resolve_lookup_value` method to properly expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple constructor. This adjustment will ensure compatibility with named tuples in Django 3.0 and prevent the type errors described in the issue.",

The error trace indicates a problem in the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, where the method fails to properly handle the reconstruction of named tuples when passed as arguments to `__range`. This is further confirmed by the file context provided, which shows the implementation of `resolve_lookup_value` and the `Range` lookup class.
