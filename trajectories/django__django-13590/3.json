Specifically, the problem lies in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of the `Query` class, where named tuples are not properly handled when they are elements of a list or tuple passed to this method. The method attempts to construct a new tuple with resolved elements but fails to handle the special case where the tuple is actually a named tuple, leading to a `TypeError`. The suggested fix is to use the * operator to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` within the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is the primary suspect for the issue as it deals directly with resolving and constructing tuples. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is relevant as it defines the `range` lookup operation, which is likely where named tuples are used as arguments. The `get_normalized_value` function in `django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py` is also relevant as it deals with normalizing values, including tuples, which could be named tuples.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans are those within `Query.resolve_lookup_value`, `Range`, and `get_normalized_value`.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
