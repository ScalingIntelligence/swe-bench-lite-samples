The error is due to `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempting to resolve lookups within the tuple elements and then reconstructing the tuple with resolved elements. However, this reconstruction process fails because named tuples do not have a code path for copying an iterator, leading to insufficient arguments for the named tuple constructor. To find the relevant code, we should focus on the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, as well as any related methods in these files.",

The error specifically occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` when attempting to reconstitute the tuple. This issue can be directly tied to the code span labeled with the id 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` where the method tries to handle elements of a list or tuple. Additionally, understanding how the 'range' lookup is processed in `django.db.models.lookups.Range` within `django/db/models/lookups.py` is crucial, especially the `get_rhs_op` method which could be involved in handling the range arguments. Therefore, both sections of code need to be considered for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
