Specifically, the error occurs due to `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempting to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstructing the tuple with resolved elements. The problem arises because the named tuple's constructor is passed an iterator, which it does not support, leading to a `TypeError`. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans include:\n\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value`: This method is central to the issue as it is responsible for resolving lookup values, including those within tuples, and then attempting to reconstruct them.\n\n2. `Query.build_filter`: This method is likely involved in the filter process where the named tuples are used as arguments to the `range` filter.\n\n3. `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`: This is directly related to the `range` lookup used in the queryset filters.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue with named tuples in `range` filters after upgrading Django.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
