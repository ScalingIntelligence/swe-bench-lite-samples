It appears that the issue is within the `resolve_lookup_value` method of `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`. The error occurs because `resolve_lookup_value` attempts to reconstruct the tuple after resolving lookups, but named tuples do not accept iterators in the same way as regular tuples. To address this, the focus should be on enhancing the handling of named tuples within `resolve_lookup_value` to correctly expand the iterator. Given the context provided, the most relevant files are those dealing with query construction, expression resolution, and field lookups. The search should target these areas specifically, looking for any instances of tuple handling that might have changed between Django versions.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
