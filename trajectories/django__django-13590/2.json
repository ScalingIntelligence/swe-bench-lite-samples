This issue originates from the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class of the `django.db.models.sql.query` module. The method attempts to resolve lookups within tuples, leading to a failure when reconstructing them, as named tuples require specific fields, not an iterator. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that address this issue, focusing on the initialization of the `Query` class, the `resolve_lookup_value` method, and any other methods that interact with these. The search results include the `Query` class, its methods like `__init__` and `resolve_lookup_value`, and related helper methods, making them directly relevant for addressing the reported issue.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves named tuples being used as arguments to range queryset filters, which fails in Django 3.0 due to a change in how Django handles tuple construction. The key part of the issue is in the `resolve_lookup_value` method where Django tries to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but fails due to the named tuple's constructor not accepting an iterator. The fix proposed is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nThe provided file context already identifies a relevant section in the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values and includes a specific handling for list and tuple types. This alignment confirms the relevance of the existing context.\n\nThe new search results similarly focus on the `Query` class and its methods, searching for further relevance. Notably, the `build_filter` method, which constructs filters for queryset operations, is identified as potentially relevant due to its interplay with lookup values and expression resolution.\n\nThe `names_to_path` method, responsible for resolving field paths, also seems relevant as it interacts with field lookups and could influence how tuple arguments are processed. Moreover, the `add_fields` method, which adds fields to the query, could be connected to tuples used in range filters, depending on how these fields interact with the filter logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are valid based on their relevance to the reported issue, detailing the handling of named tuples and their interaction with queryset filters in Django's query system.",

This issue arises specifically when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0, where a TypeError indicates that the __new__() method is missing a required positional argument. The problem stems from the django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value method, which attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple with the resolved elements. This process leads to the error because the method passes an iterator to the constructor of the named tuple, which does not support this approach. The fix suggested by the issue is to 'expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor'. After analyzing the provided file context and search results, it's clear that both 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' and 'Query.build_filter' methods are relevant to the issue, particularly where they handle tuple and named tuple values. Furthermore, these methods are responsible for resolving values and building filters, a process closely linked to the error described.

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
