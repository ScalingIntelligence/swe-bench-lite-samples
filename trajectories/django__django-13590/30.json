Specifically, the error occurs because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value attempts to reconstruct the tuple from resolved elements without proper handling for named tuples, leading to a TypeError due to missing positional arguments. To address this, the search should focus on the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `django.db.models.sql.query` module, as well as any related methods in the `django.db.models.lookups` module where logic for handling tuples and named tuples might reside. Additionally, checking the `Range` lookup class in the `django.db.models.lookups` module could be beneficial to understand how tuples are processed in range queries.",

The error occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` processes the tuple elements and attempts to reconstruct the tuple, but fails due to the named tuple's constructor not accepting an iterator. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` where the function processes the tuple elements. This is directly related to the issue because it is the function that attempts to process and reconstitute the tuple.\n2. The `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which handles the 'range' lookup.

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
