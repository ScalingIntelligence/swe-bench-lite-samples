The error occurs due to the way Django 3.0 attempts to resolve and reconstitute tuples, which doesn't account for named tuples properly. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with resolving lookup values and constructing tuples, especially in the context of queryset filters. We should focus on the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and possibly related mixins and lookups in `django/db/models/lookups.py`.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue relates to an error when upgrading a project from Django 2.2 to 3.0, specifically when named 2-tuples are used as arguments to range queryset filters. The error occurs because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements. When it attempts to construct the new tuple, it preserves the type (the named tuple) but passes an iterator to its constructor, which causes an error due to insufficient arguments. The fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are in django/db/models/sql/query.py. Specifically, the resolve_lookup_value method is highly relevant since it directly deals with resolving lookup values and includes handling for lists and tuples, which is exactly where the issue lies. The method in question recursively resolves elements of the iterable if they are expressions and handles tuples. This code span is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue. Additionally, the build_lookup and as_sql methods are also relevant as they involve constructing and compiling SQL queries, which are directly related to how range filters are processed.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, these spans provide a comprehensive context around the issue. They are sufficient to understand the current implementation concerning tuple handling and the generation of SQL queries. This understanding is essential for proposing a fix to the issue, which involves modifying how the tuple is reconstituted after resolving its elements. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete as the identified code spans offer a deep enough context around the reported problem.",

Specifically, the issue arises when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0, where the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query` attempts to resolve tuple elements and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements. This process fails when the tuple is a named tuple, as named tuples expect specific arguments and do not support being constructed from an iterator. The key elements to address in the code analysis are the `resolve_lookup_value` method and how it deals with tuples and named tuples. The search results provided include methods related to query resolution, lookup handling, and tuple processing within Django's query system. Relevant spans identified in the search results include `Query.resolve_lookup_value`, `Query.build_lookup`, and `Query.as_sql`, as these methods are central to the reported issue's context. Additionally, the `Range` lookup in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is relevant as it specifically deals with range operations, potentially where named tuples are used as arguments. Given the context of the issue, the focus should be on identifying and fixing the handling of tuples within the `resolve_lookup_value` method to ensure named tuples are supported during the upgrade process.",

However, the implementation within `resolve_lookup_value` does not directly address the specific error caused by named tuples in Django 3.0. The method currently reconstructs tuples without considering the specific nature of named tuples. Further, the `build_lookup` method and the `Range` lookup in `lookups.py` are relevant but do not explicitly address the named tuple issue. To address the issue fully, one would likely need to modify `resolve_lookup_value` to handle named tuples properly, potentially expanding the iterator into the named tuple constructor.

The error occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` attempts to reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements but fails due to the named tuple's constructor not handling iterators correctly.\n\nThe current file context and search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly focusing on the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `Range` lookup in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. The issue specifically highlights the `resolve_lookup_value` method, which handles the resolution of values within the `Query` class. The method currently attempts to resolve the elements of an iterable (like a named tuple) but does not correctly reconstruct the named tuple afterward.\n\nThe fix suggested involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. This suggests changes to the `resolve_lookup_value` method to ensure that the named tuple is reconstructed properly. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` might also require adjustments if it is implicated in the error handling or reconstruction of tuples.\n\nIdentified key areas for potential fixes:\n1. `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method to properly handle and reconstruct named tuples.\n2. Review `Range` class and its methods for compatibility with named tuples.\n\nGiven the detailed explanation and context, further analysis and modifications to these specific code spans are likely to resolve the reported issue.",

Specifically, the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class processes tuples recursively, converting each element in the tuple. However, it lacks specific handling for named tuples, which could explain the TypeError encountered when upgrading to Django 3.0. Additionally, the `build_lookup` method constructs lookups based on the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) of the expression, which may involve tuples or named tuples. The `Range` lookup class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which is used for `__range` filters, inherits from `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin`, suggesting it handles iterable rhs values. This setup might not account for named tuples properly, leading to the described error. Further investigation into how named tuples are managed and if they are being correctly unpacked or reconstructed in these methods could lead to a resolution.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
