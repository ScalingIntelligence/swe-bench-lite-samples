            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to a breaking change between Django 2.2 and 3.0 regarding the use of named tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. The error occurs because the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, preserving the type (named tuple) but passing an iterator to its constructor, which does not have a code path for handling this. The solution involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple.\n\nThe search results provide the `Query` class definition and the `resolve_lookup_value` method. The `resolve_lookup_value` method is particularly relevant because it is where the issue arises. The method processes value objects, and when it encounters a list or tuple, it attempts to resolve each sub-value independently and then reconstructs the iterable using the resolved sub-values. This reconstruction is where the error occurs for named tuples, as they cannot be instantiated directly from an iterator.\n\nGiven the specific issue, it is clear that the `resolve_lookup_value` method is directly related to the reported problem. Adjusting this method to properly handle named tuples when reconstructing them could resolve the issue. No other code spans in the search results are directly related to this problem, but reviewing and possibly modifying this method should be the focus for fixing the reported issue.",
