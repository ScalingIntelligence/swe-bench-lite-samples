The error occurs specifically in the `resolve_lookup_value` method of `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`. This method attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but fails because it doesn't properly handle named tuples. The focus should be on the `resolve_lookup_value` method and related areas where named tuples are processed. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django.db.models.lookups` should be investigated as it is directly related to the `__range` filter. The fix might involve modifying how the iterator contents are expanded into the named tuple constructor.",

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
