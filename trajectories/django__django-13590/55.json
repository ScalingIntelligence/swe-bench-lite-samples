The issue arises because the method attempts to reconstitute the tuple by preserving its type but passing an iterator to its constructor, which named tuples cannot handle. The solution involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor. The search results contain the `Query` class and its `resolve_lookup_value` method, which is directly related to the issue. The analysis of the code shows that the method indeed processes tuples and attempts to resolve their values, which could lead to the described error when handling named tuples. Therefore, the identified code span is relevant to the reported issue. Furthermore, since no relevant code has been identified in the file context, these search results are a good match for the problem at hand.",
