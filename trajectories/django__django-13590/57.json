            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves named tuples being used as arguments to `__range` in Django's query system, which results in errors when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0. This issue seems to be related to the way `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class handles tuples, particularly named tuples. When `resolve_lookup_value` iterates over the elements of a tuple to resolve lookups, it attempts to reconstruct the tuple with the resolved elements, preserving the type (in this case, a named tuple). However, since named tuples do not have a constructor that accepts iterators, this leads to a TypeError. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor.\n\nGiven the detailed description of the problem, the relevant code spans in the search results are those that pertain to `resolve_lookup_value` in the `Query` class and the `Range` lookup. The `resolve_lookup_value` method is specifically interesting because it deals with resolving the values passed to the query, including tuples. Additionally, the `Range` lookup is directly related to the `__range` operation, which is central to the issue described.\n\nBy examining the provided code spans, it's clear that the `resolve_lookup_value` method attempts to iterate over the elements of a tuple and reconstruct it, which could be the root cause of the problem when dealing with named tuples. The `Range` lookup, on the other hand, uses tuples in its `get_rhs_op` method, aligning with the context where the issue occurs. These two code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for investigation and possible fixes.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
