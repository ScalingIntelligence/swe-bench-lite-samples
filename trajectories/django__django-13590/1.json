The error occurs in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` where the tuple elements are resolved and then attempted to be reconstituted. The problem arises because the new tuple construction preserves the type (the named tuple) but passes an iterator to its constructor, which does not have the code path for copying an iterator. This results in a `TypeError` due to insufficient arguments. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are in the `Query` class, specifically the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This method iterates over a tuple, resolves each element, and then attempts to return a new tuple of the same type.

This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
