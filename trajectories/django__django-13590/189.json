            "scratch_pad": "The issue describes a breaking change when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0 involving named tuples used as arguments to `__range`. The specific error occurs in the `__new__` method of the named tuple when attempting to reconstitute it with resolved elements. This suggests that the upgrade has affected how named tuples are handled in certain parts of the Django ORM, particularly related to `resolve_lookup_value`. Given the details provided, it's clear that the focus should be on the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. Additionally, other relevant areas include `django/db/models/lookups.py` where the `Range` lookup is defined and `values_list` methods in `django/db/models/query.py` as they also handle tuple-like structures. The fix requires expanding the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor, so understanding how iterators interact with these structures in the affected files is crucial. Importantly, other files listed in the context provide valuable background on related functional components, but direct investigation into `resolve_lookup_value`, `Range` lookups, and `values_list` related classes is the main objective.",

The error is traced to the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, where the method attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements but fails because named tuples do not have the code path for copying an iterator, leading to insufficient arguments. The fix suggested is to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nIn the search_results, the `Query` class and the `resolve_lookup_value` method are directly relevant because they are the focus of the issue. The method's handling of tuples in particular needs to be reviewed to ensure that when constructing new tuples, it properly handles named tuples. The other methods in `Query` and related classes (like `batch_process_rhs` and `process_rhs` in `Lookup` and `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin`) are indirectly relevant as they deal with processing values and may need adjustments if they interact with `resolve_lookup_value`.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans should be inspected to understand how they construct tuples and how named tuples fit into the process, ensuring that all necessary arguments are provided.",

The method processes iterables by resolving their sub-values independently, which could potentially affect named tuples. Additionally, the `Range` lookup in `django/db/models/lookups.py` uses `batch_process_rhs` and `process_rhs` methods that prepare and transform values, which may also involve handling named tuples or iterators. Further investigation into these methods and their interactions with named tuples is necessary. Regarding test cases, there is no direct evidence of such within the provided context, but checking for scenarios imitating the upgrade process where named tuples are used in lookups could provide valuable insights.",

The error occurs due to the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` method not handling named tuples correctly. It attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, preserving the type (the named tuple) but passing an iterator to its constructor, which leads to an error due to insufficient arguments. The fix involves expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nGiven the context, the focus should be on the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method and how it processes tuples. The `resolve_lookup_value` method is responsible for resolving lookups, and if it encounters a tuple, it should potentially handle named tuples differently to avoid the error.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant code spans:\n- The `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is directly related to the issue, especially its handling of tuples.\n- In `django/db/models/lookups.py`, the `Range` class is mentioned, which could be the specific type of lookup causing issues with named tuples.\n- Other spans in `django/db/models/lookups.py`, such as `Lookup.process_rhs`, `FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin.batch_process_rhs`, and `Range.get_rhs_op` are also relevant as they deal with the processing of right-hand side values in lookups, which could include the problematic named tuples.\n\nBased on the provided context and search results, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue.
