            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the handling of named tuples in Django's `range` queryset filters when upgrading from version 2.2 to 3.0. The error occurs during the resolution of lookup values in the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method, specifically when converting tuples back to a named tuple type. The issue is that the named tuple's constructor does not accept an iterator, leading to a TypeError. This analysis aligns with the error description provided in the issue, indicating that the problem lies in how Django processes and reconstructs tuples within the query resolution process.\n\nGiven the search results, two key files contain relevant code spans: `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/lookups.py`. In `query.py`, the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method is where the error occurs. It recursively resolves lookup values and tries to reconstruct tuples (which include named tuples) by passing a resolved iterator to the tuple constructor. This method is critical for understanding and fixing the issue. In `lookups.py`, the `Range` class is identified as the part of the codebase where the `range` lookup is defined, indicating that this class might need modifications to enhance compatibility with named tuples.\n\nThe identified spans are: `Query.resolve_lookup_value` in `query.py` which currently causes the error and `Range` in `lookups.py` which is directly associated with the `range` lookup functionality. These spans are essential for addressing the issue by either modifying the tuple reconstruction logic or extending support for named tuples.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
