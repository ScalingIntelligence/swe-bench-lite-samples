The error arises because the `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` method attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then tries to reconstruct the tuple with the resolved elements. This process fails when dealing with named tuples due to the lack of a code path for copying an iterator in the named tuple's constructor. Therefore, the focus is on identifying the code spans that handle the resolution and reconstruction of tuples within the `resolve_lookup_value` method. The search results include relevant code spans from `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, particularly the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values, including those within tuples. The relevant code span that needs to be addressed is the one where the tuple is reconstructed with resolved elements. Additionally, the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is also relevant as it is associated with the `__range` filter, which is the context where named tuples are being used as arguments.",
