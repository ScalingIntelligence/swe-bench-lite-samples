The specific error, TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far', indicates that the named tuple's constructor is receiving an iterator instead of the expected positional arguments. This is due to the way django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value handles tuple elements for resolving lookups. To resolve this, one would need to expand the contents of the iterator into the named tuple's constructor. Given the issue description and potential relevant files, we need to focus our search on the Query class within django.db.models.sql.query.py, specifically the resolve_lookup_value method, as well as any related methods in the same file that might handle tuple resolution or reconstruction. This should help identify where the iterator mismanagement occurs and provide context for the necessary fix.",

The error occurs because the method django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, but does so incorrectly, preserving the type (named tuple) and passing an iterator to its constructor, which raises a TypeError due to insufficient arguments. The proposed fix is to unpack the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code span appears to be the method Query.resolve_lookup_value. This method is responsible for resolving lookup values and it specifically handles lists and tuples by attempting to resolve each sub_value independently and then reconstituting the tuple. This is the exact point where the error occurs when dealing with named tuples. Therefore, the focus should be on this method to apply the fix for unpacking the iterator contents into the constructor of the named tuple.",
