The error occurs in the `resolve_lookup_value` method within the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, where the method attempts to resolve lookups within tuple elements and then reconstruct the tuple. This reconstruction fails when the tuple is a named tuple because named tuples do not have the code path for copying an iterator. The suggested fix is to use the * operator to expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n\nGiven this context, it is clear that the relevant code spans to address the issue are located within the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method and the `Range` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. The `resolve_lookup_value` method handles the reconstruction of tuples, and the `Range` class is directly related to the range filter functionality, which is where the named tuple is being passed as an argument.\n\nThus, I identify these specific code spans as relevant to the reported issue to ensure that the necessary modifications are made to fix the error when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0.",

  "initial_message": "Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.\nDescription\n\t\nI noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.\nThis project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\nThis happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.\nWhen it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.\nNamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.\nThe fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.\n"
