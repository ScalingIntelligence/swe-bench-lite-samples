The error occurs because Django 3.0's resolve_lookup_value method attempts to reconstruct the named tuple using an iterator, which fails due to insufficient arguments. We must find the code section responsible for this reconstruction and ensure it properly expands the iterator contents. The search results include the 'Query.resolve_lookup_value' method, which is likely where the issue originates. This method processes value objects, including named tuples, and attempts to resolve them. The goal is to modify this method to properly handle named tuples. Additionally, understanding the context in which 'QuerySet' and 'ModelIterable' are used will provide a more comprehensive view of the issue. However, for the immediate fix, focusing on 'resolve_lookup_value' is crucial.",

Given this, the file context provides the relevant part of the codebase that is under scrutiny for the error.
