Specifically, the problem occurs when named tuples are used as arguments to range queryset filters. The error is traced back to the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django.db.models.sql.query.Query`, where the method attempts to reconstitute the tuple after resolving lookups. This process fails because it does not correctly handle the initialization of the named tuple when passed an iterator, leading to a TypeError due to insufficient arguments. The solution involves expanding the iterator into the constructor of the named tuple. Based on this understanding, the most relevant code spans are those that involve the `resolve_lookup_value` method, as this is directly implicated in the error. Furthermore, the entire `Query` class and its `__init__` method are relevant due to its direct relationship with the problematic method.
