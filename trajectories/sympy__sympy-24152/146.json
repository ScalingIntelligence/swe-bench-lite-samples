  "initial_message": "Bug in expand of TensorProduct + Workaround + Fix\n### Error description\r\nThe expansion of a TensorProduct object stops incomplete if summands in the tensor product factors have (scalar) factors, e.g.\r\n```\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import *\r\nU = Operator('U')\r\nV = Operator('V')\r\nP = TensorProduct(2*U - V, U + V)\r\nprint(P) \r\n# (2*U - V)x(U + V)\r\nprint(P.expand(tensorproduct=True)) \r\n#result: 2*Ux(U + V) - Vx(U + V) #expansion has missed 2nd tensor factor and is incomplete\r\n```\r\nThis is clearly not the expected behaviour. It also effects other functions that rely on .expand(tensorproduct=True), as e.g. qapply() .\r\n\r\n### Work around\r\nRepeat .expand(tensorproduct=True) as may times as there are tensor factors, resp. until the expanded term does no longer change. This is however only reasonable in interactive session and not in algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Code Fix\r\n.expand relies on the method TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct(). The issue arises from an inprecise check in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() whether a recursive call is required; it fails when the creation of a TensorProduct object returns commutative (scalar) factors up front: in that case the constructor returns a Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..)).\r\nI thus propose the following  code fix in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() in quantum/tensorproduct.py.  I have marked the four lines to be added / modified:\r\n```\r\n    def _eval_expand_tensorproduct(self, **hints):\r\n                ...\r\n                for aa in args[i].args:\r\n                    tp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])\r\n                    c_part, nc_part = tp.args_cnc() #added\r\n                    if len(nc_part)==1 and isinstance(nc_part[0], TensorProduct): #modified\r\n                        nc_part = (nc_part[0]._eval_expand_tensorproduct(), ) #modified\r\n                    add_args.append(Mul(*c_part)*Mul(*nc_part)) #modified\r\n                break\r\n                ...\r\n```\r\nThe fix splits of commutative (scalar) factors from the tp returned. The TensorProduct object will be the one nc factor in nc_part (see TensorProduct.__new__ constructor), if any. Note that the constructor will return 0 if a tensor factor is 0, so there is no guarantee that tp contains a TensorProduct object (e.g. TensorProduct(U-U, U+V).\r\n\r\n\r\n\n"
