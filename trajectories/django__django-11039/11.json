The solution proposed is to modify how 'self.output_transaction' is assigned in the 'sqlmigrate' command, to also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Additionally, a test needs to be added to 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to check the behavior when 'can_rollback_ddl' is set to False. I'll focus my search on the 'sqlmigrate' command file and related database features to understand how 'can_rollback_ddl' affects SQL output during migrations.",

The relevant code spans to address this issue are in the `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, particularly the `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is currently assigned to `migration.atomic`. This assignment needs to be modified to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` also contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which defaults to False but can be overridden by specific database backends to indicate support for transactional DDL rollback.

The solution involves changing the `sqlmigrate` assignment of `self.output_transaction` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well.\n\nReviewing the provided files and code spans, the main file of interest is `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, particularly the `Command.handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is currently assigned based only on `migration.atomic`. This assignment should be updated to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\nThe related feature that needs to be checked is `can_rollback_ddl`, which is defined in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` under the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class. This feature is currently set to `False`, which is the default for most databases, indicating that they do not support transactional DDL. This setting needs to be considered in the `sqlmigrate` command.\n\nAdditionally, a test should be added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as `False` and verify that the `sqlmigrate` command behaves correctly.\n\nThe additional search results include several files but none of them directly impact the logic that needs to be updated in the `Command.handle` method, which is the core of the solution for this issue.",

According to the issue, a test is needed in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to check the behavior when 'can_rollback_ddl' is set to False to ensure the 'sqlmigrate' command does not include BEGIN/COMMIT for databases that do not support transactional DDL. The context indicates that such a test does not exist in the provided file. This implies that the test either needs to be created or is present elsewhere and needs to be located.",

The identified solution involves modifying the sqlmigrate logic to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl in addition to migration.atomic. Furthermore, a new test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py is suggested to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False. Upon analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the focus should be on the implementation of the sqlmigrate command and the features related to transactional DDL compatibility in the database backend. The relevant code spans include the Command class in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py where the output_transaction attribute is set based on migration.atomic, and the BaseDatabaseFeatures class in django/db/backends/base/features.py which defines the can_rollback_ddl attribute. However, it's noted that the existing file context already covers the necessary sections in the Command class to address the issue by considering connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. The search results also show the BaseDatabaseFeatures class confirm the presence and state of can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, the tests/migrations/test_commands.py code does not currently include the specific test described in the issue, suggesting that it needs to be added to mock the can_rollback_ddl feature appropriately. In summary, the provided code spans are sufficient to modify the sqlmigrate command to consider can_rollback_ddl and to implement the suggested test.",
