I analyzed the provided code spans and identified the relevant parts. In 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', the 'handle' method sets 'self.output_transaction' based solely on 'migration.atomic'. To address the issue, this assignment needs to be updated to also check 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Additionally, for completeness, I looked into 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' to understand the 'can_rollback_ddl' attribute and its default value in 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class. This attribute indicates whether the database supports rolling back DDL statements, which is crucial for the adjustment in 'sqlmigrate'.",
