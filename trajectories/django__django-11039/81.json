This discrepancy is due to the current logic only considering the atomicity of the migration and not the capability of the database to rollback DDL. To address this, the relevant code needs to be found and modified to consider both migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Key files to look into are those that deal with schema editing, database operations, and specifically `sqlmigrate` command. Additionally, tests in `test_commands.py` should be updated to mock this behavior.",

The task involves modifying 'sqlmigrate' to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' in addition to 'migration.atomic', and adding a test to verify this behavior. The relevant code spans are identified as follows:\n\n1. In 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', we find the 'Command' class and its 'handle' method, which is responsible for executing the 'sqlmigrate' command. This is relevant because it is the core logic where changes need to be made to check 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n\n2. In 'django/db/backends/base/features.py', the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class contains the 'can_rollback_ddl' attribute. This attribute determines if the database supports rolling back DDL statements, which is crucial for the new logic in 'sqlmigrate' to consider.\n\n3. The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' initializes with 'atomic_migration' considering 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' and 'atomic'. This indicates that the schema editor is already partially aware of the need to handle transactional DDL appropriately, meaning the 'sqlmigrate' logic should align with this.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the 'sqlmigrate' command needs to be updated to properly check and utilize 'can_rollback_ddl', and the identified code spans provide the context necessary for understanding and implementing this change.",

The provided file context includes the sqlmigrate command file, which has an attribute output_transaction that might need adjustment. The features file also has a flag can_rollback_ddl that needs to be considered. Additionally, the schema editor initialization uses these features.
