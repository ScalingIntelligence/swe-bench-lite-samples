Initially, it appears that `output_transaction` is currently set only based on the `migration.atomic` attribute, which does not account for the database's ability to rollback DDL statements. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` includes the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which should be checked in conjunction with `migration.atomic` to decide whether to enclose the SQL in BEGIN/COMMIT statements.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` specifically the `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is set to `migration.atomic`.
