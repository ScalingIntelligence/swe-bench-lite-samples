Relevant files and functions include `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, `DatabaseSchemaEditor` subclasses, `BaseDatabaseOperations`, `BaseDatabaseWrapper`, `BaseDatabaseFeatures`, and the `sqlmigrate` command itself.

The current implementation only checks for the atomicity of the migration and not if the schema editor can rollback DDL. This can be resolved by modifying the sqlmigrate command to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl when determining if a transaction should be outputted. The search results include several relevant code spans. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, there is a span that defines the `Command` class, which includes the `handle` method where the `self.output_transaction` is set based on `migration.atomic`. This is where the change should be made to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, there is a span that defines the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` where the `atomic_migration` attribute is set considering the `can_rollback_ddl` feature of the connection. This suggests that this feature is already being used elsewhere in the code to determine transaction behavior, and thus it would be appropriate to integrate it similarly within the `sqlmigrate` command. Furthermore, the connection feature `supports_transactions` in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` supports the overall issue context related to transaction handling. The identified code spans are relevant for understanding and implementing the required change.",

Specifically, the `sqlmigrate` command's handling of transaction boundaries is defined, and it currently depends only on `migration.atomic`. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class also contains the `atomic_migration` attribute, which is determined by `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and `atomic`. These are essential components for implementing the suggested change to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic` during transaction boundary determination. Additionally, the file context indicates the presence of the `collect_sql` method, which is relevant for testing and collecting SQL statements. Based on this analysis, it appears that all relevant code segments needed to address the issue are present in the file context.",
