The proposed solution involves modifying 'sqlmigrate' to take 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' into account when determining whether to use BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, a test needs to be added to verify this behavior.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the following code spans seem relevant:\n\n1. In 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', the 'handle' method of the 'Command' class sets 'self.output_transaction' based on 'migration.atomic'. This should be updated to also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n\n2. In 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', the 'execute' method of 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' raises a 'TransactionManagementError' if executing DDL statements within a transaction on databases that can't perform a rollback. This indicates that the underlying 'can_rollback_ddl' feature is critical in managing DDL transactions.\n\n3. The 'can_rollback_ddl' feature is defined in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' under the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class. This confirms the existence of the feature that needs to be considered when deciding whether to use BEGIN/COMMIT in the 'sqlmigrate' command.\n\nGiven these findings, the fix should indeed involve updating the 'sqlmigrate' command to check 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' and adjusting how 'self.output_transaction' is determined. Additionally, a test case should be created to mock 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' being False and verify that no BEGIN/COMMIT is added in such cases.",

The sqlmigrate command file directly references the migration's atomicity, which is part of the problem identified. The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in the schema file also relates to DDL handling, particularly with the can_rollback_ddl feature and its impact on atomic transactions. The features file defines can_rollback_ddl, which is crucial for the sqlmigrate command's decision to wrap migrations in BEGIN/COMMIT. Given these direct references to the components discussed in the issue, it appears that all relevant file context has been identified.",
