This is evident in the handle method where the self.output_transaction attribute is assigned based solely on migration.atomic. To address the issue, the assignment of self.output_transaction should be modified to also consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute. This change will ensure that the BEGIN/COMMIT wrapping only occurs when both the migration is atomic and the database supports rolling back DDL.

This requires changes in the 'sqlmigrate' command assignment of 'self.output_transaction' to include 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. The search results include relevant code spans from 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' and feature files from different database backends such as SQLite and PostgreSQL, which define 'can_rollback_ddl' as a feature. Examining these code spans will help in understanding where and how to modify the 'sqlmigrate' command to incorporate this feature check. Specifically, the 'Command' class in 'sqlmigrate.py' needs to be updated to check 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' alongside 'migration.atomic' for determining 'self.output_transaction'. Additionally, the feature classes in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py' and 'django/db/backends/postgresql/features.py' show how 'can_rollback_ddl' is defined for these databases. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of where to integrate this check and how to implement it accurately across different database types.",
