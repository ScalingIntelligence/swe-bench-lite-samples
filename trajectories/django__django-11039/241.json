This problem arises because the current logic only considers the `migration.atomic` attribute and fails to account for the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` capability. To address this, the `sqlmigrate` command needs to be updated to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in its decision-making process. Additionally, a test should be added in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to verify this behavior. Given the scope and the nature of the issue, focusing the search on the `sqlmigrate.py` file within the `django/core/management/commands/` directory and `features.py` within the `django/db/backends/base/` directory would be appropriate. Also, considering the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` for potential involvement in the fix.",

Additionally, the feature flag `can_rollback_ddl` is defined in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` under `BaseDatabaseFeatures`, and its usage in schema editing contexts is found in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` under `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__` and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute`.
