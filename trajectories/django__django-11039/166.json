The problem lies in the method of determining whether to wrap output in BEGIN/COMMIT, which currently only considers the migration's atomicity. To fix this, we should adjust the sqlmigrate command to consider the database's capability to rollback DDL statements as well. Relevant files identified so far include those related to schema editing in different database backends and the sqlmigrate command itself. The main logic to modify appears to be in the sqlmigrate command handling, potentially involving the assignment and usage of self.output_transaction. Additionally, a test should be added in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to validate the behavior with a mocked database that does not support transactional DDL.",
