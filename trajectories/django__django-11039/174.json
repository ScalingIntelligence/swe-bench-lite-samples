In sqlmigrate.py, the command class creates SQL statements for migrations, but the relevant span would involve modifying the assignment of self.output_transaction to also use connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Likewise, the features.py files for different DB backends should also be reviewed in case changes need to be made regarding how can_rollback_ddl is handled.

The relevant code snippet is found in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, where `self.output_transaction` is currently assigned based only on the `migration.atomic` attribute. This is where the change needs to be made to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The feature flag itself is defined in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` and overridden in database-specific feature files like `django/db/backends/postgresql/features.py` and `django/db/backends/mysql/features.py`. The file context provided is sufficient to identify and implement the required change.",
