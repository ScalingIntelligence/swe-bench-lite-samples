The task is to modify `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`. Additionally, a test should be added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure the correct behavior when `can_rollback_ddl` is `False`. The provided search results contain the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, which currently sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. Altering this assignment to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` will address the issue. Furthermore, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` contains the `can_rollback_ddl` feature, which is currently set to `False` by default. This feature is relevant because it would be checked to determine if the database supports rolling back DDL statements. The `MigrationExecutor.collect_sql` method in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` also references the `atomic` attribute of migrations, indicating that changes here might also be necessary depending on how `self.output_transaction` is used subsequently. The identified code spans are sufficient to begin implementing the solution and understanding the context of the issue.",

The current sqlmigrate logic only considers migration.atomic, and the fix suggests changing sqlmigrate to also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. The task is to find the relevant code spans in the provided search results and decide if the search task is complete.\n\n1. Analyze the reported issue: The issue is about the sqlmigrate command not checking the ability of the database to rollback DDL before wrapping the output in BEGIN/COMMIT.\n\n2. Review Current Context: The context provided includes files and code spans from django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, django/db/backends/base/features.py, and django/db/migrations/executor.py. These files are relevant as they deal with the sqlmigrate command, database features, and migration execution, respectively.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n   a. django/db/backends/base/features.py: This file contains the definition of the BaseDatabaseFeatures class, which includes the can_rollback_ddl attribute. This attribute is central to the issue.\n   b. django/db/backends/base/operations.py: This file contains operations related to database features, including executing SQL flush and ending transactions.\n   c. django/db/migrations/autodetector.py: This file deals with auto-detection of migrations, which is not directly related to the issue at hand.\n   d. django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py: This file contains operations for migrations, which are related but not directly applicable to the issue.\n   e. django/db/migrations/__init__.py: This file initializes migrations, which are related but not directly applicable to the issue.\n   f. django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py: This file deals with inspecting the database and generating a Django model module, which is not directly related to the issue.\n   g. django/core/management/commands/migrate.py: This file deals with the migrate command, which is related but not directly applicable to the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are found in django/db/backends/base/features.py and django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py.
