The key code spans that need attention are the initialization of `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` where `atomic_migration` is defined, the handling of `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, and the `handle` method in the `Command` class within `sqlmigrate.py`.

The file 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' also suggests that the schema editor initializes the atomic_migration attribute with a check involving can_rollback_ddl, indicating its potential relevance.

This means that the `sqlmigrate` command should not be setting `self.output_transaction` to True if the database cannot rollback DDL operations. Here's the breakdown of the key points and how they align with the provided code: The main focus is on the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its `__init__` method. Specifically, `atomic_migration` is being set based on `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`. This setting is currently only considering `migration.atomic` in the `sqlmigrate` command. The issue suggests changing the `sqlmigrate` command's assignment of `self.output_transaction` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well. This aligns with the code in `Command.handle()` where `self.output_transaction` is set to `migration.atomic`. However, the current code does not consider the database's ability to rollback DDL operations when setting this attribute.To resolve this issue, the line `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` should be updated to also check if `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is True. Additionally, the test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` will need to be updated to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class and its `can_rollback_ddl` attribute will need to be considered in the implementation change.",
