The critical points for addressing this issue are:1. Modifying `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when setting `self.output_transaction`.2. Adding a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure correct handling of non-transactional DDL.Looking at the provided context and new search results:1. The relevant code spans initially identified are in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, specifically the `Command` class and its `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is currently set based only on `migration.atomic`. However, this logic needs to be updated to incorporate `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.2. New search results do not provide additional insights beyond what's already known from the context. Thus, a change in the `handle` method to check both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` before setting `self.output_transaction` is necessary.3. No new test-related code spans are provided in the search results, indicating further search or writing of tests may be needed in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`.",

Furthermore, a test should be added to ensure the behavior is correctly implemented and tested. From the provided context and search results, the relevant files and spans are: 1. django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py - This file contains the Command class which is responsible for the sqlmigrate command. The handle method is where the self.output_transaction is currently set based on migration.atomic. 2. django/db/migrations/executor.py - This file contains the MigrationExecutor class, which is used by the sqlmigrate command to collect SQL statements. The MigrationExecutor's migration_plan and collect_sql methods are key for understanding how migrations are processed and SQL is collected. Notably, connection.features.can_rollback_ddl needs to be checked before wrapping SQL in a transaction. 3. django/db/backends/base/features.py - This file defines the BaseDatabaseFeatures class, which contains the can_rollback_ddl attribute that needs to be checked. Looking at the search results, the relevant spans include the handle method in the Command class (span_id 'handle') in sqlmigrate.py, and the __init__ and collect_sql methods in the MigrationExecutor class (span_id 'MigrationExecutor.__init__' and 'MigrationExecutor.collect_sql') in executor.py.
