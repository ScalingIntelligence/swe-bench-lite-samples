The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor and its subclasses like DatabaseSchemaEditor for SQLite, Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL will be important to check for how they handle DDL transactions. The sqlmigrate command itself in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py and the MigrationExecutor in django/db/migrations/executor.py should be reviewed for how they handle atomic migrations and schema editor functionalities.",

Additionally, there's a need to add a test in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py'. From the search results, it's evident that 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' is relevant, particularly for understanding how DDL statements are managed and for seeing how 'can_rollback_ddl' is related to the atomic nature of migrations. However, the key section will be within the 'sqlmigrate.py', where we will need to modify the 'Command.handle' method to adjust the assignment based on 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. This integration with database features and handling should align with the broader logic in 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor'. Furthermore, we need to confirm that the 'data'; Key spots: 1.
