In the current context, the sqlmigrate command's handle method already sets self.output_transaction based solely on whether the migration is atomic. The new search results confirm the presence of this method, allowing us to identify the relevant code span. To address the issue, we need to modify the assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl, ensuring that the BEGIN/COMMIT are only wrapped around the output if the database supports transactional DDL. This modification should be made in the handle method of the `Command` class in the `sqlmigrate.py` file.

Additionally, the creation of a new test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` using `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` would also validate the fix.

This method sets self.output_transaction based on migration.atomic, but does not currently take connection.features.can_rollback_ddl into account.
