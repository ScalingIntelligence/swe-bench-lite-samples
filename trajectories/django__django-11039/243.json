The solution involves modifying `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`. Additionally, a test needs to be added in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as False. Given the context and the description, the search should focus on the `sqlmigrate` command file, `schema.py` files in database backends, and `MigrationExecutor` in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`.",

This behavior is currently controlled by the migration.atomic attribute in the Command class in sqlmigrate.py. The task is to modify this logic to also consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute. Additionally, a new test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py has been suggested to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False. As I analyze the provided code, the relevant parts include the Command class in sqlmigrate.py, specifically where self.output_transaction is set, and the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in schema.py, which initializes self.atomic_migration to check the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute. Both of these parts of the codebase will need to be updated to address the issue and ensure the test is added to verify the change. However, the search results provided do not include the tests/migrations/test_commands.py file where the new test should be added. Therefore, while I can identify the relevant code spans that need modification, the search task is not complete as the relevant test file is not included in the search results.",
