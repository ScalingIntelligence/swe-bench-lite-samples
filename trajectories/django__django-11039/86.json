The relevant files to look into are likely those related to schema editing and database features, as well as the sqlmigrate command itself. Also, there's a need to add a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False.",

This behavior should be adjusted to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl, and a test needs to be added to verify the change. The relevant code spans identified primarily involve the Command class in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', which is responsible for handling the sqlmigrate command. The 'Command.handle' method sets self.output_transaction based on migration.atomic, but not on connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' initializes self.atomic_migration based on connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic, which suggests this class could also be relevant, particularly for understanding how schema changes are handled transactionally. The 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' defines can_rollback_ddl, indicating whether the database supports rolling back DDL statements. This field is crucial for determining the behavior of transactional DDL operations.",
