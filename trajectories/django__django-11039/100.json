This is especially important for databases that do not support transactional DDL. Given the context provided, the focus should be on identifying the exact location in the `sqlmigrate` command and the `MigrationExecutor` class where the atomic nature of the migration is determined, ensuring that `can_rollback_ddl` is checked in addition to the existing `migration.atomic` check. The search should also consider the `SchemaEditor` classes in various database backends as they may influence how DDL operations are handled and potentially rolled back. Testing adjustments might also be necessary in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`.",

Additionally, a test should be added to verify this behavior. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that can help address this issue. Specifically, the 'Command' class in 'sqlmigrate.py' defines the behavior of the 'sqlmigrate' command, including its 'handle' method where the migration executor is instantiated.

The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'schema.py' is also relevant as it interacts with the database schema and is used within migration operations.
