From the search results, the relevant code spans are located in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. In `sqlmigrate.py`, the `Command.handle` method sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. This logic needs to be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, which is found in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__` in `schema.py`. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class handles transactions related to DDL operations, which is relevant to ensuring the correct behavior. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `features.py` contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which should be checked to determine if the database supports transactional DDL. Overall, these code spans are relevant to the issue as they directly involve the logic around transactional DDL and the generation of SQL migrations.",
