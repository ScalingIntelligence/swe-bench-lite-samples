This is currently only considering the atomic attribute of the migration, but should also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. To address this, the sqlmigrate assignment of self.output_transaction should be modified to include this check. Additionally, a test should be added to ensure this behavior is correctly managed for databases that do not support rollback of DDL operations. The relevant files and classes to investigate include the sqlmigrate command, the MigrationExecutor for how it handles migration execution, and the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor as well as its derived classes to understand how schema editing is managed across different databases.",

Based on the provided code, the responsibility for handling this lies primarily within the 'sqlmigrate' command itself and the 'MigrationExecutor' class, as well as the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' for managing transactions. The key elements identified in the reported issue are:\n\n1. The 'sqlmigrate' command needs to modify the assignment of 'self.output_transaction' to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n2. The 'MigrationExecutor' will likely need adjustments to handle transactional DDL properly, especially within its 'collect_sql' method.\n3. The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class plays a role in defining how transactions are managed and is initialized with the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, a solution can be developed that aligns with specific database behavior, thus resolving the issue without overly generalizing the fix.\n\nTo address the issue further, the following sections of code are highlighted as relevant: the 'Command.handle' method in the 'sqlmigrate' command, the 'MigrationExecutor.collect_sql' method, and the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' initialization, particularly related to handling the 'atomic_migration' parameter based on the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature attribute.",
