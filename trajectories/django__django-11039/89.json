This behavior is determined by the `atomic_transactions` and `can_rollback_ddl` attributes in the database features. The relevant code spans are in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` for the `Command` class where `output_transaction` is defined and used, and in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` where `atomic_transactions` and `can_rollback_ddl` are defined. These code spans need to be modified to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when deciding to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` is relevant for understanding how the schema editor handles atomic transactions and rollbacks, which could be useful for testing and ensuring the changes do not break existing functionality.",

There is a connection feature `AtomicDatabaseFeatures` and checker under the `features.py` file which might need referencing additionally as the schema editor caters to the atomic transaction that directly relates to the migration execuition. The current code already considers `migration.atomic` but does not include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` which is indeed a Issue point that Feedback also aligns with and explicitly suggested else, it remains misleading with unintentional Commit/Attack Rollbacks. In testing context, the tests suggestion is also picked from feedback which indicates to add or modify tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to check against the correct status using by default `False` non roll-ddl mocks as mentioned noting tips.

Additionally, there's a requirement to add a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to verify the implementation. From the provided context and search results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` is currently setting `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic` instead of taking into account the capability of the database to rollback DDL statements, which is indicated by `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. This needs to be adjusted to consider both conditions.\n\n- In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class initializes with `atomic_migration` being set based on the `can_rollback_ddl` feature of the connection. This underscores the importance of this feature in determining whether a migration should be wrapped in a transaction.\n\n- The `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` attribute is explicitly used in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__`, suggesting that this feature is meant to be a critical consideration for handling migrations transactionally.\n\n- Further supporting the issue's focus, the search results include the declaration of `can_rollback_ddl` in `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, defaulting to `False`, indicating that databases typically do not support transactional DDL.\n\nGiven these points, the task is to ensure that `sqlmigrate` respects the `can_rollback_ddl` feature when deciding to wrap SQL statements in transactional boundaries, and to test this behavior.\n\nThe relevant files and code spans appear to be:\n- `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- `django/db/backends/base/features.py`\n- `django/db/migrations/executor.py`",

Additionally, it includes the `MigrationExecutor` class and the `Migration` class, which are central to the migration execution process. The context also includes the `migrate.py` command, which orchestrates the migration process. The analysis suggests that the current logic in `sqlmigrate.py` only considers `migration.atomic` and does not check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. This confirms the necessity to modify the `handle` method in `sqlmigrate.py` to add the check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and to update the tests accordingly as suggested in the issue.
