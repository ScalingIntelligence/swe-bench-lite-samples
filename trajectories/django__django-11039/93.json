The current implementation only considers migration.atomic, but it should also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. This involves modifying the sqlmigrate command and adding a test. The search results reveal relevant code spans in the sqlmigrate command and features related to database support for transactional DDL. Specifically, the Command class in sqlmigrate.py sets self.output_transaction based on migration.atomic, which needs to be updated to also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, the features.py files for different database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL) define the can_rollback_ddl attribute, which should be checked in the sqlmigrate command. This analysis indicates that the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the issue.",
