Specifically, the code in django/db/backends/base/schema.py and django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py appears to be directly related to the functionality at hand. The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in schema.py contains the logic for schema editing, including the handling of atomic migrations and the ability to rollback DDL statements, which is critical for addressing the issue. Additionally, the Command class in sqlmigrate.py, which controls the sqlmigrate command, has an attribute output_transaction that would likely need modification to take connection.features.can_rollback_ddl into account, as suggested by the issue. These files provide the necessary context to understand and potentially modify the code to address the reported issue. Furthermore, the references to connection.features.can_rollback_ddl in schema.py suggest that additional relevant code may exist in the django/db/backends directory, particularly in files related to database features and backends. Given these findings, it appears that the file context is sufficiently complete to address the issue as described.",
