The analysis of the provided code reveals that the current implementation in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' exclusively checks for 'migration.atomic' and does not account for 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. This is crucial because 'can_rollback_ddl' helps determine if a database supports transactional DDL, a feature that should influence whether BEGIN/COMMIT is used in the sqlmigrate output. Additionally, the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' contains 'can_rollback_ddl' as a feature but is currently set to False. To address the issue properly, the existing code needs to be updated to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. This involves changing the assignment of 'self.output_transaction' in the 'sqlmigrate' command to take into account both 'migration.atomic' and 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Furthermore, a test should be added to 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to ensure that the new behavior is properly tested.",
