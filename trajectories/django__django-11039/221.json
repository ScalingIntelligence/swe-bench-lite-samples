This suggests an update to `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`. The search results reveal relevant sections of code: \n1. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, the `Command.handle` method is responsible for generating SQL for migrations. Here, `self.output_transaction` is set based solely on `migration.atomic`, which aligns with the issue's description. This is the primary location where the change is needed.\n2. In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` constructor initializes `self.atomic_migration` considering `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. This indicates understanding of transactional DDL capabilities, which should be mirrored in `sqlmigrate.py`.\n3. In `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, `BaseDatabaseFeatures` defines `can_rollback_ddl` as `False` by default, which subclasses like `DatabaseFeatures` can override. This supports the need to incorporate `can_rollback_ddl` into the `sqlmigrate` logic.\nGiven these findings, it's clear that the necessary code spans are in `sqlmigrate.py` where `self.output_transaction` is set, and awareness of `features.py` for future tests involving `can_rollback_ddl`.",
