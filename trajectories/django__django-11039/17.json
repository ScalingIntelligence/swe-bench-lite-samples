The search results provided contain the relevant code in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` which initializes the `self.output_transaction` attribute based on `migration.atomic` in the `handle` method of the `Command` class. The search results also include the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, which is related since it handles the execution of migrations. This code is pivotal because the outer BEGIN/COMMIT logic is controlled by the atomicity of migrations and whether DDL can be rolled back.
