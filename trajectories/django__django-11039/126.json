This issue can be addressed by modifying the sqlmigrate logic to consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute, ensuring it evaluates whether the schema editor can rollback DDL, not just if the migration is atomic. Additionally, a test should be added to test_commands.py to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as False. Focus the search on the sqlmigrate.py file and related backend feature files where the can_rollback_ddl feature is defined or used.",

The current logic in the sqlmigrate command only considers the atomicity of the migration but doesn't check if the database connection features support rolling back DDL operations. To address this, the code needs to be updated to consider the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` attribute. The relevant code spans identified are in the `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` file, specifically the `Command` class, which defines the behavior of the sqlmigrate command. The `self.output_transaction` attribute is set based on the atomicity of the migration, and this logic needs to be updated to also check the `can_rollback_ddl` feature of the database connection. Additionally, the `django/db/backends/base/features.py` file contains the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class, which defines `can_rollback_ddl` as False by default. These code spans are relevant to understanding how the sqlmigrate command sets its transaction output and how database features are defined that could affect this output.",
