Additionally, we should add a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False. From the search results, we observe the following:\n\n1. The `sqlmigrate` command is defined in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`. This file contains the `Command` class and its `execute` method, which currently sets `no_color` to True but does not consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n2. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` has an `__init__` method that initializes `atomic_migration` based on `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and `atomic`. This indicates a relevant part of the code where transactional behavior is determined.\n\n3. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which is a boolean indicating whether the database can rollback DDL operations. This attribute is crucial for determining the transactional behavior around DDL operations.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue. The `sqlmigrate` command needs to be updated to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, and the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and `BaseDatabaseFeatures` classes provide the necessary context to implement this change.",

The task requires changing the `sqlmigrate` assignment of `self.output_transaction` to include this consideration. The relevant code in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` should be modified to add this check. Additionally, a test should be added in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure that `sqlmigrate` behaves correctly when `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is set to False. The search results provided show the `Command` class in `sqlmigrate.py`, which sets `output_transaction` based on `migration.atomic`.
