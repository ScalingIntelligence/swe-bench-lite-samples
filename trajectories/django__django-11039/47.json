These files define the `Command` class for `sqlmigrate`, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class with its `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, and the `MigrationExecutor` class responsible for executing migrations and collecting SQL statements. The `handle` method in `sqlmigrate.py` is where `self.output_transaction` is set based on `migration.atomic`, aligning with the issue's suggestion to consider `can_rollback_ddl`. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class provides the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute which should be checked in addition to `migration.atomic` in `sqlmigrate` to ensure correct transactional behavior.
