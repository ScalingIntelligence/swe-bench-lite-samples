The current implementation of `sqlmigrate` only considers `migration.atomic` to determine if it should wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements. This needs to be adjusted to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, the code analysis revealed that the `sqlmigrate` command initializes `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. To address the issue, the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` should be updated to consider both conditions before deciding whether to include BEGIN/COMMIT statements. Furthermore, `BaseDatabaseFeatures` in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` defines `can_rollback_ddl` as `False` by default, which indicates the need for future consideration if specific database backends support this feature. This review identified the exact span in the `Command.handle` method where the change is required, ensuring the path forward for implementing the required modification accurately.",
