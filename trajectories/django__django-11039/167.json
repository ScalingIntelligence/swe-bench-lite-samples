The current logic in `sqlmigrate` only considers the `atomic` attribute of the migration, whereas it should also take into account `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. To address this, we need to modify the `sqlmigrate` command to include this feature check. Additionally, a test needs to be added in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure that the new logic is working correctly. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the `sqlmigrate` command and related database features for the initial search is crucial.",

The provided file context shows the existing logic in the Command.handle method where self.output_transaction is set to migration.atomic. This is directly relevant to the issue as it exposes where the modification needs to be made to include the check for connection.features.can_rollback_ddl.
