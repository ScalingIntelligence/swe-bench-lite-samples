To address this, the 'sqlmigrate' command should consider both 'migration.atomic' and 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when determining whether to include the 'BEGIN/COMMIT' statements. The search results include several relevant files from the Django codebase, particularly the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', where the 'atomic_migration' attribute is set based on 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. This is highly relevant to solving the issue. Additionally, the 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' classes in various database backends (e.g., 'oracle', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3') are included, though they do not directly address the issue of 'sqlmigrate'. The 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' is also relevant as it defines the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' is relevant as it is the actual command being discussed in the issue. Based on the analysis, the identified code spans are in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' (specifically the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class and its '__init__' method), 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' (specifically the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class), and 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' (specifically the 'Command' class and its 'execute' method).
