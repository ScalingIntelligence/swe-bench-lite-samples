The relevant code spans to address this issue are located in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py and django/db/backends/base/features.py. In sqlmigrate.py, the Command class's handle method sets self.output_transaction based only on migration.atomic. This needs to be updated to also check connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, the BaseDatabaseFeatures class in features.py defines the can_rollback_ddl attribute, which should be checked to determine if the database supports transactional DDL.
