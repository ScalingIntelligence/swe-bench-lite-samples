This problem is tied to how the sqlmigrate command assesses whether to use transactions based solely on the migration's atomicity. The fix involves considering the database's capability to rollback DDL during this assessment. This involves modifying the sqlmigrate command to take connection.features.can_rollback_ddl into account, which will require changes in the sqlmigrate module and a new test in the migrations/test_commands.py file to ensure this feature is properly tested.",

The solution involves changing the assignment of `self.output_transaction` in the sqlmigrate command to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, a test should be added to ensure this behavior is properly tested. The search results include relevant code spans from `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. In `sqlmigrate.py`, the `Command` class and its `handle` method are particularly relevant for adjusting the `self.output_transaction` setting. In `executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class is relevant for understanding how migrations are executed and how transactional behavior is currently managed.
