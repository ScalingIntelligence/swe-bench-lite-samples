            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue emphasizes the need to modify the `sqlmigrate` command to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` for transaction handling, especially for databases that do not support transactional DDL. Currently, the `sqlmigrate` command only considers `migration.atomic` for deciding if `BEGIN/COMMIT` should be added around the migration SQL. The search results contain relevant code spans in both `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`. In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, there are several spans that deal with schema editing and transaction management, including `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__enter__` and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute`. These are relevant because they deal directly with atomic transactions and execution of DDL statements. The `execute` method checks if `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is `False` and raises a `TransactionManagementError` if DDL statements are executed within an atomic block on databases that cannot rollback DDL. This confirms the necessity to modify the transaction handling logic. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, the `Command.handle` method sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. This is the exact point where the logic needs to be updated to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. These findings indicate that the identified code spans are highly relevant to the issue and should be considered for modification to address the reported problem.",
