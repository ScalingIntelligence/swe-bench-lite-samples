This involves modifying the assignment of self.output_transaction in the Command class of sqlmigrate and adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to mock can_rollback_ddl as False. 2. I analyzed the search results and found relevant code spans. The initial spans I focused on are those related to the Command class in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, particularly the parts dealing with atomicity and transaction handling. This is because the reported issue directly affects how transactions are handled in SQL migrations. 3. Additionally, I looked into the BaseDatabaseFeatures class in django/db/backends/base/features.py to understand the setting and conditions related to can_rollback_ddl. 4. Also examined the DatabaseWrapper in django/db/backends/mysql/base.py to understand how constraint checking is enabled, as constraints and transaction handling are closely related. This comprehensive review helps ensure that the changes in sqlmigrate consider all relevant factors, including database feature capabilities and transaction management.",
