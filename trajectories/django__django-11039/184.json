The solution is to modify the assignment of self.output_transaction in the sqlmigrate command to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well. Additionally, a test should be added in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overriding MIGRATION_MODULES. This indicates that the focus should be on the sqlmigrate command logic and ensuring it checks for can_rollback_ddl in connection features before wrapping statements in transactional blocks. Also, relevant tests should be updated to account for this new behavior.",

This is determined by the database's ability to rollback DDL operations, which is indicated by the can_rollback_ddl feature. The current implementation of the sqlmigrate command only considers the migration's atomicity, not the database's capability for transactional DDL. To address this, the logic should be updated to consider both the migration's atomicity and the connection features' ability to rollback DDL. In the search results, two relevant sections are found. First, the Command class in sqlmigrate.py initializes the output_transaction attribute based on the migration's atomicity. Second, the BaseDatabaseFeatures class in features.py contains methods and properties for handling transaction support, which indirectly inform the can_rollback_ddl feature. These sections need to be adjusted to incorporate the can_rollback_ddl check during the assignment of output_transaction. The DatabaseSchemaEditor class in sqlite3/schema.py is related but focused on schema editing rather than the sqlmigrate command's output logic directly. The other files mention features and database initialization, but do not directly impact the issue at hand, as they focus on general database configuration or dummy database features.",
