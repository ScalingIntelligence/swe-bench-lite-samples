The relevant code changes could be in the sqlmigrate command file under django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, specifically focusing on how it sets the self.output_transaction attribute. Additionally, the BaseDatabaseFeatures class in django/db/backends/base/features.py should be considered, as it includes properties like can_rollback_ddl to signal if the backend supports transactional DDL operations. Also, database connection handling in django/db/backends/base/base.py might touch on how schema editors behave transactionally.

This requires changes in the `sqlmigrate` command and potentially testing changes in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant code spans were found:\n1. **django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py** - This file contains the `sqlmigrate` command implementation, specifically the `Command` class and its `handle` method. This is where the `self.output_transaction` is assigned based on `migration.atomic`.\n2. **django/db/backends/base/features.py** - This file contains the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class, which includes the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute. This attribute needs to be checked to determine if the database supports transactional DDL.\n3. **django/db/backends/base/base.py** - This file contains the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class, which is likely where the connection to the database is managed and where `connection.features` is accessed.\n\nThe identified code spans provide the necessary context to address the issue. Specifically, the `handle` method in `sqlmigrate.py` needs to be modified to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when determining whether to use transactions.
