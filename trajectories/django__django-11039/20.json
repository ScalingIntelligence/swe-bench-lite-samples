This issue arises because the current sqlmigrate logic only considers the migration.atomic flag and not the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature. This indicates that the relevant code spans should include the definition and usage of the sqlmigrate command within django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, the connection handling and features in django/db/backends/base/base.py, and the features themselves in django/db/backends/base/features.py. The search results include the Command class and its handle method in sqlmigrate.py, which is central to understanding the current implementation of the sqlmigrate command. Additionally, the BaseDatabaseWrapper class in base.py and the BaseDatabaseFeatures class in features.py provide the context for the database connection and its capabilities regarding transactional DDL. These sections of code are crucial for addressing the issue as they involve the critical elements (migration.atomic, connection.features.can_rollback_ddl) mentioned in the issue description.
