Additionally, the sqlmigrate command itself needs to be checked to ensure it correctly assigns self.output_transaction based on the database's ability to rollback DDL. The feature flag 'can_rollback_ddl' should be considered in this logic. Furthermore, tests in tests/migrations/test_commands.py should be adjusted to mock the scenario where 'can_rollback_ddl' is False.",
