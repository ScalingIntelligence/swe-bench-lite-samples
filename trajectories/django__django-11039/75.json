This can cause issues where BEGIN/COMMIT is wrapped around SQL commands that cannot be rolled back. The solution involves modifying sqlmigrate to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, a test should be added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as False. Given the context provided, it's clear that the focus should be on the `sqlmigrate` command and the database features.

This change would ensure that `sqlmigrate` does not wrap its output in BEGIN/COMMIT for databases that do not support transactional DDL. The current logic of `sqlmigrate` only considers `migration.atomic` and not the capability of the database for DDL rollbacks. The `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` file contains the `Command` class responsible for the `sqlmigrate` command and its logic. The `Command.handle` method is where `self.output_transaction` is currently set based on `migration.atomic`. To address the issue, this logic needs to be updated to include a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. In `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute.
