This problem can be addressed by modifying sqlmigrate to consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute, ensuring it doesn't erroneously wrap non-transactional DDL in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, a test should be added to verify correct behavior when can_rollback_ddl is False. Relevant files and classes to focus on include those handling schema editing and database features, specifically BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor and BaseDatabaseFeatures in django/db/backends/base/, and the sqlmigrate command in django/core/management/commands/. Given the context, it's also crucial to look into the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/ for how migrations are processed and SQL collected. Although initial context doesn't specify files directly relevant to sqlmigrate's transaction handling, these broader contexts hint at critical interactions requiring adjustments.",

This behavior aligns with the current context, but it's worth investigating further to ensure this logic incorporates the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check as per the issue description. Given that the current implementation directly uses `migration.atomic` without considering the database's DDL rollback capability, it likely needs adjustment based on how `can_rollback_ddl` is handled in the database connection features.

The relevant code spans identified in the search results are within the Command.handle method where the self.output_transaction attribute is currently set based solely on migration.atomic.

The key part of the issue suggests changing the `sqlmigrate` assignment of `self.output_transaction` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well. Currently, the logic only considers `migration.atomic`. The relevant code spans should include the initialization and assignment of `self.output_transaction` in the `Command` class of `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`. Additionally, the logic for determining transactionality in the `apply_migration` method within the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` and the constructor of `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` are important. These sections of code will help in implementing the necessary changes to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` for transaction handling. Furthermore, the `MigrationExecutor` methods `collect_sql` and `apply_migration` are crucial for understanding the overall migration execution process related to SQL statements and transaction management.",

This approach does not consider the `can_rollback_ddl` feature of the database connection, which is critical for determining if BEGIN/COMMIT statements should be included in the output. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` uses `migration.atomic` to determine the atomicity of the migration, but does not explicitly check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. However, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` does initialize with `atomic=True` and `can_rollback_ddl` to determine if the migration should be atomic.

  "initial_message": "sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nThe migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT \u200bif the migration is atomic and \u200bthe schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.\nThe issue can be addressed by\nChanging sqlmigrate \u200bassignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.\nAdding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on \u200ban existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.\nI marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.\n"
