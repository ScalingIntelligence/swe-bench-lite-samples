The current logic in sqlmigrate only considers the atomicity of the migration and not the capability of the database to rollback DDL statements. \n\nTo address this, the identified code spans are crucial. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' contains the logic for the sqlmigrate command, including the 'output_transaction' attribute which decides whether to wrap the SQL with BEGIN/COMMIT. This attribute should be updated to also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. \n\nAdditionally, the 'MigrationExecutor' class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' is responsible for executing migrations, and it's where the actual SQL generation and execution occur. Understanding how migrations are applied, collected, and how the SQL is generated is essential for implementing the fix.\n\nFinally, the database features for different backends like MySQL, Oracle, and the base features in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' help in identifying how each database handles transactions and DDL rollback capabilities. This context is necessary to ensure the changes are applicable across different database types.\n\nThe provided code spans are relevant to the problem statement and provide a solid foundation to implement the required changes.",
