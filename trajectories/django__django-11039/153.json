The relevant code spans are identified in the sqlmigrate.py file where the self.output_transaction assignment is made and in the features.py file where the can_rollback_ddl feature is defined. By analyzing these code spans, I can confirm that the current implementation of the sqlmigrate command does not consider the can_rollback_ddl feature, and therefore, aligns with the reported issue.
