            "scratch_pad": "The issue pertains to the sqlmigrate command in Django's management commands, specifically where migrations might be incorrectly wrapping their output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even if the database does not support transactional DDL. The solution suggests updating the sqlmigrate command to consider both the `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` attributes when determining if transaction wrapping is necessary. Relevant files and methods include the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the BaseDatabaseOperations class in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`, and the MigrationExecutor class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The core change seems to be in the sqlmigrate command itself, where the `self.output_transaction` assignment needs to be altered to include the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check.",

This needs to be changed by considering connection.features.can_rollback_ddl in the assignment of self.output_transaction. The search results provide relevant code spans from three files: django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, django/db/backends/base/schema.py, and django/db/migrations/executor.py.\n\n1. In sqlmigrate.py, the Command class's handle method sets self.output_transaction based on migration.atomic, which is relevant as it's the current condition for transaction wrapping. The Code span 'Command.handle' is relevant here.\n\n2. In schema.py, the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class includes various methods related to schema editing, such as __init__, __enter__, __exit__, execute, and others, which are potentially relevant for understanding how transactional behavior is managed. These spans ('BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__enter__', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__exit__', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute') are relevant.\n\n3. In executor.py, the MigrationExecutor class has methods for handling migrations, including migrate, apply_migration, unapply_migration, and collect_sql, which are crucial for migration execution and DDL statement collection. These spans ('MigrationExecutor.migrate', 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration', 'MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration', 'MigrationExecutor.collect_sql') are relevant for understanding how migrations are applied and how SQL is collected during this process.\n\nGiven these findings, I can confirm that the search results contain relevant code spans that will help address the issue, as they cover the primary logic points in sqlmigrate command, schema editor behavior, and migration execution processes.",
