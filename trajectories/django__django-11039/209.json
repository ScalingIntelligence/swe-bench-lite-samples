The current logic in sqlmigrate only considers the atomicity of the migration but does not take into account the database's capability to rollback DDL. To address this, we need to modify the sqlmigrate command to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when determining whether to include BEGIN/COMMIT in the output. This involves changing the 'self.output_transaction' assignment in the Command.handle method of the sqlmigrate command. Additionally, we should identify the location where 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' is defined and ensure it's considered in the logic. From the search results, we see that 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' has a 'can_rollback_ddl' attribute in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py', which is set to False by default, indicating that most databases do not support rolling back DDL. Therefore, this attribute should be checked in the 'sqlmigrate' command logic. Relevant code spans are identified in both 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' where the 'self.output_transaction' assignment needs to be modified, and 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' where the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature is defined.",
