To address this, we need to modify `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and add a test case mocking `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False in the `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to simulate non-transactional DDL behavior.

The primary focus is on modifying the sqlmigrate command to check not only migration.atomic but also connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, the need for a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to verify the behavior when can_rollback_ddl is False is emphasized. The search results primarily involve the features.py file, specifically the BaseDatabaseFeatures class, where the can_rollback_ddl attribute is defined. This attribute is crucial for determining whether the database can rollback DDL operations. The existing context provided information on how the sqlmigrate command currently handles transactions, focusing solely on migration.atomic. To address the issue, the command's logic should be updated to include a check for connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. The search results confirm the existence of this attribute in the BaseDatabaseFeatures class, aligning with the requirements for implementing the change.",
