The key areas in the existing codebase that need attention are: \n1. **`BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__`**: This method sets `self.atomic_migration` based on `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and the `atomic` parameter. This logic should be examined for potential modifications. \n2. **`BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute`**: This method includes a check for `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and raises an error if DDL statements are executed within a transaction on databases that do not support rollback. Understanding this constraint will guide the modification of `sqlmigrate` accordingly.\n3. **`Command.handle` in `sqlmigrate`**: The current logic only checks `migration.atomic` to determine `self.output_transaction`. We need to add an additional check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to accurately reflect whether the database supports transactional DDL. \n\nThese points should guide the selection of relevant code spans to be modified or examined for implementing the fix and updating the test cases as described in the issue.",
