The suggested solution involves modifying sqlmigrate to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl when assigning self.output_transaction. Additionally, a new test should be added in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False. From the search results, we can identify two key areas of the code that are relevant to addressing this issue. The first is in the Command class within sqlmigrate.py, specifically the handle method where self.output_transaction is currently assigned based solely on migration.atomic. This assignment should be updated to also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. The second is in the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class within schema.py, where the __init__, __enter__, and __exit__ methods are responsible for handling the atomicity of DDL operations based on self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. These methods are crucial for understanding how the database's ability to rollback DDL operations is currently managed and how it can be adjusted to reflect the proposed change.",
