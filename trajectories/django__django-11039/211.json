This is due to the sqlmigrate command only considering the migration's atomicity and not checking if the database supports rolling back DDL. To address this, we need to modify the sqlmigrate command to check for both migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. The relevant code spans are found in the django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py file within the Command class and the handle method where the self.output_transaction is currently being set based solely on migration.atomic. We also need to check the features.py file to identify where can_rollback_ddl is defined. This will ensure that the sqlmigrate command can correctly determine if it should wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Based on these findings, I will input the relevant span IDs for the identified files.",

However, in the provided context, `MigrationExecutor` appears to only consider the migration's `atomic` attribute when deciding on transaction wrapping, not checking the `can_rollback_ddl` flag of the database.

It sets `output_transaction` based on the `atomic` attribute of the migration, but again, doesn't factor in the database's rollback capabilities. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class from `django/db/backends/base/features.py` contains a `can_rollback_ddl` flag which is likely to be crucial for implementing a solution that respects the database's DDL transaction capabilities.
