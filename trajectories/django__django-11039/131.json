The solution involves modifying the `sqlmigrate` command to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in its logic when determining whether to add the BEGIN/COMMIT statements. This requires changes in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` and possibly review of `django/db/backends/base/features.py` for the `can_rollback_ddl` feature. Additionally, a new test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` should be added to mock the `can_rollback_ddl` feature.",

This behavior is contingent on the migration being atomic and the schema editor being capable of rolling back DDL. The key tasks outlined for resolving this issue involve modifying the sqlmigrate command to consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature, and adding a test to verify the behavior when can_rollback_ddl is False. \n\nGiven the search results, the following files contain relevant code spans: \n\n1. `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`: This file contains the definition of the `sqlmigrate` command, where the `output_transaction` attribute is defined and used. Modifying this attribute to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` would be necessary. \n\n2. `django/db/backends/base/features.py`: This file contains the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class, which includes the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute. This attribute should be checked within the `sqlmigrate` command to determine if the outer BEGIN/COMMIT should be added. \n\n3. `django/db/migrations/executor.py`: This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class, which is responsible for applying migrations. The `apply_migration` method in this class uses the `atomic` attribute of the migration, which is relevant to the issue at hand. \n\nThese three files and their relevant code spans are crucial to addressing the reported issue, ensuring that the sqlmigrate command correctly assesses whether to wrap its output in BEGIN/COMMIT based on the database's capabilities.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights that the `sqlmigrate` command unnecessarily wraps its output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database does not support transactional DDL. This is primarily due to the current `sqlmigrate` logic only considering the `migration.atomic` field and not `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. To address this issue, the suggested approach is to modify `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when assigning `self.output_transaction`. Additionally, a test should be added in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to verify this behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis and task breakdown:\n1. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, I identified that the `Command` class (span_id='Command'), method `add_arguments` (span_id='Command.add_arguments'), and `execute` (span_id='Command.execute') methods are not directly related to the issue but are part of the command's lifecycle. Only the `handle` method (span_id='Command.handle') is directly related to this issue because it is where the output_transaction is currently set based only on migration.atomic. \n\n2. In `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, I identified the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class (span_id='BaseDatabaseFeatures') where the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute is defined (currently set to False), indicating the database's capability to rollback DDL statements. \n\n3. In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class (span_id='MigrationExecutor'), particularly the `apply_migration` (span_id='MigrationExecutor.apply_migration') method, sets up the connection's `schema_editor` with `atomic=migration.atomic`. Although the `MigrationExecutor` where initializing properties is relevant, how it interacts with `atomic` transactions is crucial and is already specified in the reference spans.\n\nOverall, the existing file context (already provided) and the current search results confirm the places within the Django codebase that need adjustment to address the reported issue. The identified files and relevant code spans from the search results align with the file's context and elaborate on certain complexities.",
