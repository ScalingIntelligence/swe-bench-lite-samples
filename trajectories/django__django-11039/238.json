This is due to 'sqlmigrate' only considering the 'migration.atomic' attribute and not checking 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Relevant files could include those involved in database schema editing and the sqlmigrate command itself. The task is to modify 'sqlmigrate' to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' and to add a test that mocks 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' to False. Given the context provided, we should focus our search on the 'sqlmigrate' command logic and the schema editor features in the database backend.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the behavior of the `sqlmigrate` command, specifically the fact that it wraps its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL. This issue arises because the current logic only considers the `migration.atomic` attribute and not `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. To address this, the key changes involve modifying the `sqlmigrate` command to take `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` into account and updating the test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`. \n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `sqlmigrate` command. Specifically, the `handle` method in the `Command` class (span id: 'Command.handle') defines the logic for generating migration SQL. The `output_transaction` attribute (span id: 'Command') determines whether to wrap the SQL in BEGIN/COMMIT, and it currently relies solely on `migration.atomic`. Aligning with the issue, this part of the code should be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n2. `django/db/backends/base/features.py`: This file defines various database backend features, including `can_rollback_ddl` (span id: 'BaseDatabaseFeatures'). This attribute is crucial for determining if the database supports transactional DDL, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n3. `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`: This file contains the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, which includes methods for schema manipulation. The `__init__` method (span id: 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__') sets the `atomic_migration` attribute based on `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. This suggests that the schema editor is designed to handle atomic transactions, making it a relevant context for the proposed change.\n\nThese code spans collectively provide the necessary context and logic to address the issue by modifying the `sqlmigrate` command to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`, and to write a test case that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False.",

The current logic only considers `migration.atomic` without regard to `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. This oversight potentially leads to incorrect transaction handling, which could affect the integrity of data operations during migrations. To address this, the `sqlmigrate` command needs to be updated to consider both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, a new test should be added in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure that the behavior is correctly implemented and to prevent regressions. From the current context and search results, I've identified that the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` is responsible for handling the SQL migration command and setting the `self.output_transaction` attribute based on `migration.atomic`. Integrating `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` into this decision-making process should resolve the issue.

We should update the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` to also check the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` attribute before setting `self.output_transaction`.

The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` already has the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which is set to `False` by default.
