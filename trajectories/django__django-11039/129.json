Search for the sqlmigrate command and related classes like BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor, focusing on how the `output_transaction` attribute is set.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the 'sqlmigrate' command wrapping its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL. The key to addressing this lies in modifying the 'sqlmigrate' command to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' in addition to 'migration.atomic'. Additionally, a test needs to be added to verify this behavior. Upon analyzing the provided code spans in the search results, several relevant sections were identified:\n\n1. In 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', the 'Command' class is relevant as it directly handles the 'sqlmigrate' command. It initializes 'output_transaction' based on 'migration.atomic', and its 'handle' method collects SQL statements based on this setting. Adjustments here would involve considering 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when deciding whether to wrap SQL in a transaction.\n\n2. In 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class is crucial. It contains methods '__init__', '__enter__', and '__exit__' which manage the transaction context based on 'atomic_migration', which in turn depends on 'can_rollback_ddl'. This is directly related to the transaction handling logic that needs adjustment.\n\n3. The 'MigrationExecutor' class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' is also pertinent, particularly the 'apply_migration' method, which applies migrations within a transaction context, closely tied to the issue at hand.\n\nThese sections provide the foundational code necessary to implement the required changes and add the test. Together, they offer a comprehensive view of the codebase's handling of migrations and transactions, aligning well with the reported issue's request for modification.",
