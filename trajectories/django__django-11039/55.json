The relevant code spans for `sqlmigrate` are found in the `Command.handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is set based on `migration.atomic`. Additionally, we should inspect the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute` method where the check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is already present, suggesting it could be a critical part of the solution.
