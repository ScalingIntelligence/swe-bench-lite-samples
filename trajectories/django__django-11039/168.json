The issue arises because the current logic only considers the migration's atomic property and not the connection's ability to rollback DDL. To address this, the relevant code needs to be found within the sqlmigrate command logic to modify the behavior of self.output_transaction to also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py should be added to mock the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl behavior. Given the context provided, it's clear that the change should affect the sqlmigrate command and potentially the MigrationExecutor class as well, considering it also interacts with migration execution.",
