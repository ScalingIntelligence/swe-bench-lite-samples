This involves modifying the sqlmigrate to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl in addition to migration.atomic. Additionally, a test needs to be added in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False. The relevant files and classes identified in the provided context include BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor, DatabaseSchemaEditor for various database backends (SQLite, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL), BaseDatabaseOperations, BaseDatabaseWrapper, BaseDatabaseFeatures, Command in sqlmigrate, MigrationExecutor, and Atomic in transaction. A focused search in the sqlmigrate command and related schema editors should provide the necessary context to address the issue.",

This issue can be addressed by changing how 'sqlmigrate' assigns 'self.output_transaction' to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' in addition to 'migration.atomic'. The relevant files and code spans in the search results are 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', and 'django/db/backends/base/features.py'. These files contain classes and methods related to the SQL migration commands, database schema manipulation, and database features. The specific code span in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' involves the 'Command' class and the 'handle' method, which initializes the 'MigrationExecutor' and the database connection. The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' includes an '__init__' method that sets 'self.atomic_migration' based on 'self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. In 'django/db/backends/base/features.py', the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class defines the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature. It's important to check how 'sqlmigrate' handles 'output_transaction' and modify it to consider this feature.
