Currently, the logic only considers the migration's atomic attribute, but it should also check the connection's can_rollback_ddl feature. To address this, the assignment of self.output_transaction in the sqlmigrate module needs to be modified to include this check. Additionally, a test should be added to test_commands.py to ensure that the behavior is correctly modified. Given the context provided, the focus should be on the sqlmigrate.py and features.py files, particularly the sqlmigrate command's handling of transaction wrapping and the connection's feature attributes.",
