The primary focus is to modify the 'sqlmigrate' command to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' in addition to 'migration.atomic' for determining whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. To address this, we need to identify code in 'sqlmigrate.py' that affects the setting of 'output_transaction' and 'features.py' where the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature is defined. The current context is empty, indicating no previous relevant code has been identified. From the search results, the 'sqlmigrate.py' contains the 'Command' class with 'output_transaction' attribute and 'execute' and 'handle' methods, which are likely places to look for changes. In 'features.py', the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class includes 'can_rollback_ddl' as a feature flag.
