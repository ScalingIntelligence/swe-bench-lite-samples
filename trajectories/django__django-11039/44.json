The current implementation only considers `migration.atomic`. The relevant code spans are found in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` where the `Command` class sets `output_transaction = True`, which is the assignment to be changed. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute that needs to be checked. This feature is currently set to `False` by default, but the command should dynamically evaluate this based on the database connection. The `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` also plays a crucial role in handling migrations and the transaction behavior. We should ensure that when compiling SQL for a migration, the `output_transaction` flag is set appropriately based on `can_rollback_ddl`. This involves understanding how the migration executor interacts with the database features and adjusting the SQL generation process accordingly.",
