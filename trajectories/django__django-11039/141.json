The relevant code spans initially identified are in the `django.core.management.commands.sqlmigrate` module where the `sqlmigrate` command is defined, and within the `MigrationExecutor` class in the `django.db.migrations.executor` module which is used by the sqlmigrate command to execute migrations. The specific method of interest in the `Command` class is `handle`, where the `self.output_transaction` attribute is assigned based on `migration.atomic`. This attribute is crucial because it determines whether the output SQL is wrapped in a transaction. Enhancing this method to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` will be necessary to address the issue. The `collect_sql` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class also uses the atomicity to collect SQL statements and will similarly need adjustments if there are changes to the transaction handling logic based on the database's DDL rollback capabilities.",
