From the search results, we can see relevant files in the Django codebase that can be modified to incorporate this change. The file `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` contains the `Command` class which includes the `handle` method where we can adjust the logic to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` includes the `__init__` method where `self.atomic_migration` is currently set based on `can_rollback_ddl` and `atomic`. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` defines `can_rollback_ddl`, which provides the necessary feature flag to determine if DDL statements can be rolled back. By leveraging these code spans, it's feasible to incorporate the requested changes and ensure that sqlmigrate properly handles the transaction wrapping based on the database's capabilities.",
