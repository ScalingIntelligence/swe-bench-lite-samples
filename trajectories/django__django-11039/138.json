The current implementation only considers the 'atomic' attribute of the migration, but it should also take into account whether the database supports transactional DDL operations. To address this, the 'sqlmigrate' command needs to be updated to consider the 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' feature. Additionally, a test should be added to verify the behavior under these conditions. The relevant classes and functions to look at include those related to the database schema editor, database operations, and the migration executor. The initial search focus should be on the 'sqlmigrate' command implementation and the schema editor for various databases.",

The reported issue concerns the behavior of the `sqlmigrate` command, which incorrectly wraps its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL. The solution outlined in the issue suggests modifying `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`.\n2. The current file context is empty, indicating no previous identification of relevant code.\n3. In the search results, several code spans are relevant:\n   - In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, the `Command` class and its `handle` method are relevant because they are responsible for executing the `sqlmigrate` command.\n   - In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class, particularly the `collect_sql` method, is relevant because it collects SQL statements, including those that might need to be conditionally wrapped in transactions.\n   - In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its `execute` method are relevant because they handle the execution of SQL statements and need to respect the transaction behavior.\n   - In `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class and its `can_rollback_ddl` attribute are relevant because they define the feature that indicates whether the database supports rolling back DDL operations.\n\nGiven these findings, the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans have been identified.",

Additionally, the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' includes the 'atomic_migration' attribute, which checks 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' and the 'atomic' parameter.
