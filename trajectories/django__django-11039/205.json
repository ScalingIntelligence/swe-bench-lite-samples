This stems from the sqlmigrate logic not considering the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute, which indicates if the database can handle DDL rollbacks. The solution involves changing sqlmigrate to consider this feature and adding a test for non-atomic migrations. Given the detailed description and the specific files that were initially provided, the focus should be on the sqlmigrate command and its interaction with the database features and schema editor. Therefore, the search should concentrate on the files and components involved in sql migration management and database features.",
