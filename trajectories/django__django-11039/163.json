The guidance suggests modifying the `sqlmigrate` command to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`. To address this, we should identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the `sqlmigrate` command and the conditions under which it decides to include BEGIN/COMMIT statements. The `MigrationExecutor` and associated classes are likely involved in the decision-making process, and `schema.py` files across different database backends may also be relevant. It's also important to ensure that any changes are tested thoroughly, and the guidelines suggest adding a new test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`.",

From the search results, the relevant code spans are in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', and 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py'. In 'sqlmigrate.py', we have the command class handling migrations and the 'execute' method which could potentially be checking the 'migration.atomic' without considering the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature. In 'migrations/executor.py', the 'MigrationExecutor' class and its methods handle migration plans, applying and unapplying migrations, and collecting SQL, all of which might need adjustment based on 'can_rollback_ddl'. Lastly, in 'schema.py', the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class initializes with 'atomic_migration' checking 'can_rollback_ddl' and 'atomic', relevant to controlling transactional behavior. The identified code spans are the 'Command' class, 'MigrationExecutor' class, and 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class, along with their methods.
