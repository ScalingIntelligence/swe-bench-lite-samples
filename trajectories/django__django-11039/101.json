This occurs because the current logic only takes into account the migration's atomicity, not whether the database schema editor can roll back DDL operations. To resolve this, the sqlmigrate command needs to be modified to include a check for connection.features.can_rollback_ddl when determining whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, a test should be added to confirm the behavior with DDL that cannot be rolled back. The relevant files and code snippets to be investigated are likely in the sqlmigrate.py file and possibly in other database backend schema editor files.",

This is the primary area to modify to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` initializes `atomic_migration` based on `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, which indicates that this feature flag is indeed relevant to the task at hand.
