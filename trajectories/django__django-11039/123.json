This problem occurs because the current `sqlmigrate` logic only considers `migration.atomic` and not `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. To address this, we need to modify the `sqlmigrate` command to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when determining whether to output the transaction. We also need to add a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False. Given the context provided, the relevant files include `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, and potentially others related to database features and schema editing.",

Additionally, the context includes `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, which defines `can_rollback_ddl` and suggests where modifications might be necessary to integrate this feature check into the `sqlmigrate` command.
