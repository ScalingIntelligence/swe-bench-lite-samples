The current logic in 'sqlmigrate' only considers the 'atomic' attribute of the migration, not the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature of the database connection. To address this, the logic in 'sqlmigrate' should be updated to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when determining whether to include the transaction wrapper. Additionally, a test should be added in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to ensure proper behavior when 'can_rollback_ddl' is False. Therefore, we need to find relevant code in 'sqlmigrate', 'migrations', and 'schema' files, especially focusing on the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class and its subclasses, and the 'Command' class in 'sqlmigrate.py'.",

The `Command` class in `sqlmigrate.py` is responsible for handling the `sqlmigrate` command, and its `handle` method currently sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. This needs to be updated to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `features.py` contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which indicates if the database supports transactional DDL. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `schema.py` uses the `can_rollback_ddl` feature to determine if it should use atomic transactions.
