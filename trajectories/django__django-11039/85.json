This is related to how the MigrationExecutor handles atomicity during migrations. Given the search results, the key areas of code to focus on are where the atomicity of migrations is considered and how the schema editor operates. Specifically, the method `MigrationExecutor.collect_sql` indicates that `atomic=migration.atomic` is passed to the schema editor. It is crucial to modify this to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic` to ensure proper handling of DDL statements in environments where transactional DDL is not supported. This adjustment should resolve the issue of unnecessarily wrapping the output in BEGIN/COMMIT blocks. Further, it would be prudent to add tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure that this behavior is consistently applied and can be verified under controlled test conditions.",
