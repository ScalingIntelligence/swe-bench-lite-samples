Specifically, it should also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to `migration.atomic`. The relevant code spans can be identified in the `sqlmigrate.py` file. The main area of focus is the `Command` class which handles the execution of the sqlmigrate command. The key method to modify is `handle` where the `self.output_transaction` attribute is currently set based solely on `migration.atomic`. This needs to be adjusted to also include a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to correctly determine if the output should be wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT statements. Additionally, the method `add_arguments` and possibly parts of the `execute` method might also warrant a review if further features or arguments are required to enhance the command's functionality in view of this issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on improving the 'sqlmigrate' command to consider the ability of the database to rollback DDL (Data Definition Language) changes. The current implementation of 'sqlmigrate' only considers the 'atomic' attribute of the migration, but it should also check 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Analyzing the provided code spans, the following are identified as relevant:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py**\n   - The command class 'Command' and its 'handle' method where the 'output_transaction' attribute is set based solely on 'migration.atomic'. This needs to be updated to also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n\n2. **django/db/backends/base/features.py**\n   - The 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class contains the attribute 'can_rollback_ddl', which should be checked to determine if the database supports transactional DDL. This is crucial for the proposed change in 'sqlmigrate'.\n\n3. **django/db/backends/base/schema.py**\n   - The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class includes the 'atomic_migration' attribute, which is set based on 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Although this is more related to schema editing, understanding how it integrates with the feature flags is important for the broader context.\n\n4. **django/db/backends/postgresql/features.py**\n   - The 'DatabaseFeatures' class for PostgreSQL shows how specific database features are overridden or extended, including 'can_rollback_ddl'. This provides a concrete example of how database-specific features might influence the behavior of 'sqlmigrate'.\n\n5. **django/db/backends/oracle/features.py** and **django/db/backends/mysql/features.py**\n   - These files extend 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' for Oracle and MySQL, respectively, showing how the base features are customized for specific database backends. Reviewing these can provide insights into how 'can_rollback_ddl' might be handled differently across various databases.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified spans are directly related to the issue and provide necessary context and code base for implementing the described change.",
