The current logic in 'sqlmigrate' only considers the 'atomic' property of the migration, not 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. To address this, we need to identify the part of the code where 'self.output_transaction' is set in the 'sqlmigrate' command and the part of the code where 'can_rollback_ddl' feature is defined. From the provided search results, I found 'self.output_transaction = migration.atomic' setting in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' under the 'Command.handle' span. Additionally, I found 'can_rollback_ddl = False' in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' under the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' span. Both these spans are relevant for addressing the issue. The 'Command.handle' span is where the change in logic needs to be applied to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when setting 'self.output_transaction'. The 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' span is where the relevant feature for checking if the database supports rollback DDL is defined.
