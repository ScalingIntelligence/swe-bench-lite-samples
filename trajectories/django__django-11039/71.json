The current logic in sqlmigrate only looks at the migration's atomicity, but it should also check if the database can rollback DDL. Relevant files likely include those handling database features, schema editing, and migration execution. Initial focus should be on sqlmigrate.py, schema.py files for various database backends, and features.py to ensure that all necessary attributes and methods are considered.",

The suggested solution involves changing `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The search results provide several relevant areas of the code:\n\n1. `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`: This file contains the `Command` class which is responsible for handling the `sqlmigrate` command. The `handle` method is where the interaction with the database and migrations occur.\n\n2. `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`: This file contains the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class which handles schema editing for databases. The `__init__` method initializes `atomic_migration` based on `can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n3. `django/db/backends/base/features.py`: This file contains the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class which defines various features and capabilities of the database backend. Notably, `can_rollback_ddl` is set to `False` by default.\n\n4. `django/db/backends/oracle/features.py` and `django/db/backends/postgresql/features.py`: These files implement backend-specific features. Both backends set `can_rollback_ddl` to `False` for Oracle and `True` for PostgreSQL, indicating support for transactional DDL only in PostgreSQL.\n\nThese findings suggest that the current implementation of `sqlmigrate` in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` does not consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Thus, modifying the `Command` class in this file to consider this feature when determining whether to wrap the output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` would address the reported issue.",

The file context includes sections from sqlmigrate.py, schema.py, and features.py, which are pertinent to the issue. The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in schema.py already initializes with atomic_migration considering connection.features.can_rollback_ddl, suggesting some existing sensitivity to the feature. The relevant code seems identified, addressing the core of the issue of handling transaction boundaries based on database capabilities. The features.py files also specify database-specific capabilities that are relevant to the determination of whether DDL can be rolled back, aligning with the issue's requirement. Given these observations, it appears that the file context is comprehensive enough to address the issue without needing further significant exploration of additional code sections.",
