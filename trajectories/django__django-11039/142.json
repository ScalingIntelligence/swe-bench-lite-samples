This is currently only considering the `migration.atomic` property but should also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. To address this, we need to modify how `self.output_transaction` is assigned in `sqlmigrate` to include this new condition. Additionally, a test case needs to be added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` being False. From the provided context, it's clear that the relevant files are mostly in the `django/db/backends` directory and the `django/core/management` directory, where the `sqlmigrate` command is defined.",

The context so far is clear that no relevant code has been identified yet, and the first search results include two relevant files: `django/db/backends/base/operations.py` and `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`. In `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`, the method `execute_sql_flush` already checks `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` within a transaction, which suggests that this feature is already recognized as relevant to transaction handling in some parts of the codebase. This knowledge can inform our search for how to modify the sqlmigrate command. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, the Command class has a boolean attribute `output_transaction` that is currently set based solely on the migration's atomicity, as shown in the `handle` method. This is the exact point of logic that needs to be extended to include a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. These files and relevant code spans seem to directly address the issue by providing the parts of the codebase that need modification or inspection to fix the issue.",
