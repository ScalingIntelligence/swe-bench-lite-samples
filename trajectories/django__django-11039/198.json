To address this, the 'sqlmigrate' command needs to be updated to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when determining whether to surround the migration output with BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, a test should be added in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to ensure the behavior is correctly handled for databases that do not support transactional DDL.

We should also consider the places where connection.features.can_rollback_ddl is either directly or indirectly used. From the provided search results, a few key areas stand out:\n1. In django/db/backends/base/schema.py, the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class handles various SQL operations and transaction management. Specifically, the __init__, __enter__, and __exit__ methods manage the atomic_migration attribute based on the connection's ability to rollback DDL and the atomic parameter. This is where the transaction is controlled directly in the schema editor. Additionally, the execute method checks the connection's ability to rollback DDL before executing DDL statements within a transaction.\n2. In django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, the Command class sets the output_transaction attribute, which determines whether the output SQL should be wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT statements. Modifying the assignment of this attribute to also consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl would be crucial to address the reported issue.\nBy addressing these points, we can ensure that the sqlmigrate command properly respects the database's capability to perform DDL rollbacks.",

This class is responsible for schema editing operations, which is relevant to the reported issue since it relates to the handling of transactional DDL. The constructor (__init__) of this class already considers 'self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when setting up 'self.atomic_migration'. This suggests that the schema editor is already designed to handle the atomicity of DDL based on database capabilities. Additionally, the 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' file is provided, which includes the Command class for the 'sqlmigrate' command. However, this class currently does not check 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' directly, focusing instead on 'output_transaction'. This confirms the need for modification in the 'sqlmigrate' command to integrate the check for 'can_rollback_ddl'. Based on the current context, it appears all relevant aspects of the issue are covered, pointing to the necessity of updates in the 'sqlmigrate' command and potentially a new test in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py'.",
