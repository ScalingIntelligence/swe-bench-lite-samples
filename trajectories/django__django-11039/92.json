The current implementation of the `sqlmigrate` command in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` only checks `migration.atomic` to determine whether to wrap the output in `BEGIN/COMMIT`. To address the issue, the `sqlmigrate` command should also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The relevant spans from `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` are 'Command' and 'Command.handle', which are responsible for the logic of the `sqlmigrate` command. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class in `django/db/backends/base/base.py` contains the `features` attribute, which includes `can_rollback_ddl`, and should be referenced in the `sqlmigrate` command's logic. The span 'BaseDatabaseWrapper' is relevant for understanding how database features are managed. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` also has relevant spans such as '__init__', '__enter__', and '__exit__', which deal with schema editing and transactions.",
