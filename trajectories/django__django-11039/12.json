The solution proposed is to modify the sqlmigrate command to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl when deciding whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. To address this, I have analyzed the provided code spans and identified the relevant parts. The Command.handle method in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py currently sets self.output_transaction based only on migration.atomic without considering the database's capabilities for rolling back DDL. This is the key area where the change is needed. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor.collect_sql method is identified as relevant because it uses the atomic attribute of migration to determine if it should use the connection's schema editor in an atomic way, which directly relates to the BEGIN/COMMIT wrapping behavior.",

The current implementation only checks migration.atomic. The relevant code span to modify is within the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, specifically where `self.output_transaction` is set. We also need to ensure that a test is added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` based on an existing test for non-atomic migrations, mocking `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False. The search results provide insights into how different database backends handle features like `can_rollback_ddl`, which is crucial for implementing the correct behavior in the sqlmigrate command. Specifically, `django/db/backends/base/features.py` defines `can_rollback_ddl` and its default value. Other files in the search results detail how this feature is overridden or adapted by specific databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite.

The suggested solution involves altering `sqlmigrate` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and adding a test for this scenario. The current context already provided relevant code spans in `sqlmigrate.py` and `executor.py` that are closely related to the issue. The new search results largely duplicate the feature classes for different database backends, which include details on `can_rollback_ddl`. From these results, I identified essential parts in `BaseDatabaseFeatures` and variations in database-specific features, highlighting where `can_rollback_ddl` is defined or overridden. This will be crucial for updating the `sqlmigrate` logic to correctly handle the transactional behavior based on database capabilities.",

The 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class in 'features.py' defines 'can_rollback_ddl', which is a key feature needed for addressing the issue based on the reported issue's requirements.
