Relevant parts of Django's codebase likely involve the schema editors for different databases, the features module for database capabilities, and the sqlmigrate command itself. It's also suggested to add a test to ensure this behavior is properly tested. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the sqlmigrate command and the interface for schema editors is crucial.",

The current implementation only considers `migration.atomic` for determining whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT, but it should also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. This means we need to identify the relevant code spans where `self.output_transaction` is set in the `sqlmigrate` command and where `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is defined and used. From the search results, the following key areas are relevant:\n1. The `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` where `self.output_transaction` is assigned based on `migration.atomic`.\n2. The `__init__` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` where `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is involved in determining `self.atomic_migration`.\n3. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` where `can_rollback_ddl` is defined, indicating whether the database supports rollback of DDL statements.\nConsidering these areas, the identified code spans will help address the issue by ensuring `sqlmigrate` respects the `can_rollback_ddl` feature when determining transactional behavior.",
