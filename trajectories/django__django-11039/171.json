This adjustment will ensure that the output does not include BEGIN/COMMIT if the database does not support transactional DDL. Additionally, for implementing the new test, relevant sections in 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' and 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' are needed to understand how transactions and DDL rollbacks are handled. The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class includes the 'atomic_migration' property that checks 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl', which is crucial since the issue can be resolved by changing 'sqlmigrate' to use this instead of only 'migration.atomic'. The 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class contains the 'can_rollback_ddl' attribute, setting to False by default. This suggests that databases not supporting transactional DDL would need this to be overridden. The provided code spans demonstrate how these features are implemented, providing a foundation for addressing the issue and testing it. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant for both resolving the issue and guidance on where to implement the necessary changes and test.",

However, there's no explicit consideration of connection.features.can_rollback_ddl yet, which is essential for the fix. The schema.py file includes the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class, which is relevant as it deals with DDL operations, and the init method of this class already checks for self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to set the atomic_migration attribute. The features.py file includes the definition of BaseDatabaseFeatures which contains can_rollback_ddl, indicating a basis for controlling transactional DDL. The provided file context seems adequate to start addressing the issue, though more complete code related to the handling of these features during migrations execution might be needed to fully implement the fix.",
