The provided search results show relevant code spans in three files: `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. Specifically, `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` contains the implementation of the `Command` class for the `sqlmigrate` command, which is where the logic for setting `self.output_transaction` resides. This logic currently only considers `migration.atomic`, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, `django/db/backends/base/features.py` defines the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class, which includes the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute that needs to be checked. Lastly, `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` defines the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, which is relevant for understanding how schema editing is managed in relation to transactions. These code spans seem relevant for addressing the issue because modifying `self.output_transaction` in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` would directly address the reported issue.",
