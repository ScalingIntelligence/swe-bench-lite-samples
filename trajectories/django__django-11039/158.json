This suggests modifications in the logic that sets the `output_transaction` attribute in the sqlmigrate command class. The relevant part of the code is at the 'Command.handle' method where `self.output_transaction` is set based solely on the `migration.atomic` attribute. To address the issue as described, the code should also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, which suggests that modifications are needed both in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' and potentially in how the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature is handled or propagated. The feature 'can_rollback_ddl' is defined in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py', indicating that both files are relevant for the solution.

This needs to be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n2. **Relevance in `features.py`**: The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class contains the `can_rollback_ddl` property, which indicates if the database supports rolling back DDL statements.
