The current logic in sqlmigrate only considers the atomicity of the migration but doesn't check if the database can rollback DDL. This inconsistency needs to be addressed by modifying how sqlmigrate determines whether to include the transactional wrapper. Specifically, the command should also consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl attribute when deciding to apply the transaction. From the search results, I identified relevant code spans in the `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` file, as it contains the implementation of the sqlmigrate command. The `Command.handle` method is particularly relevant because it handles the execution of the command and sets the `self.output_transaction` attribute based on the migration's atomic attribute. In the `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor.collect_sql` method also appears relevant as it generates SQL statements based on the migration plan, and its behavior might need to be adjusted in conjunction with the sqlmigrate command changes. Additionally, the `django/db/backends/base/base.py` file contains the `BaseDatabaseWrapper.schema_editor` method, which is used to create a schema editor object that can execute SQL commands and handle transactions. Lastly, the `django/db/backends/base/features.py` file includes the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class, which holds various database features, including `can_rollback_ddl`. All these code spans collectively provide the necessary context and functionality to address the issue by adjusting how transactions are handled in relation to the database's capability to rollback DDL.",
