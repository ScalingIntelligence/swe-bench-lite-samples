This is due to the current sqlmigrate logic only considering the atomicity of the migration, not the capability of the database to rollback DDL. To fix this, we need to modify sqlmigrate to also consider the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` attribute. The primary file to look into is `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, focusing on the handling of migration atomicity and the output of transaction statements. Additionally, it's beneficial to delve into the schema editor classes in `django/db/backends/*/schema.py` to understand how transactions and DDL are managed. A targeted search on the exact line or function that checks for atomic migrations but overlooks the capability of the database (`can_rollback_ddl`) will be essential.",

The current implementation in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` under `Command.handle` assigns `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`. Additionally, `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` initializes `atomic_migration` considering `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` but this is not used in the sqlmigrate command.
