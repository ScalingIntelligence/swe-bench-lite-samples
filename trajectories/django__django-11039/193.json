            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the 'sqlmigrate' command wrapping its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL. The solution involves modifying the 'sqlmigrate' command to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when deciding whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. To address this, we need to focus on the sections of the code that handle the 'sqlmigrate' command and the 'MigrationExecutor' class which manages migrations. The relevant code spans include the 'Command' class for the 'sqlmigrate' command, the 'MigrationExecutor' class, and the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class, as well as the logic that checks 'can_rollback_ddl' in the database features. The identified spans cover the initialization of the 'MigrationExecutor', the 'sqlmigrate' command's 'handle' method, the execution and application of migrations in 'MigrationExecutor', and the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' which is relevant for schema changes including how transactions are managed. These code sections should help in addressing the reported issue since they encapsulate the logic related to migration execution, transaction handling, and the 'sqlmigrate' command's behavior.",

Specifically, 'sqlmigrate.py' shows how the 'self.output_transaction' attribute is currently set based on the migration's atomicity. However, it does not consider the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature of the database. The 'executor.py' file shows how the MigrationExecutor handles migrations and transactions, and 'schema.py' shows the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor, which is likely where the 'can_rollback_ddl' feature would need to be considered in the context of schema editing. The 'features.py' file defines the BaseDatabaseFeatures class, which includes the 'can_rollback_ddl' attribute. Given this, it appears that the necessary parts of the codebase are present to address the issue, but the current logic in 'sqlmigrate.py' does not yet integrate the 'can_rollback_ddl' check.

            "scratch_pad": "The issue centers around sqlmigrate not accounting for whether the database can execute transactional DDL. Currently, sqlmigrate only checks if the migration is atomic, but it fails to consider the database's ability to rollback DDL operations. The file context shows that sqlmigrate sets `self.output_transaction` based on the atomicity of the migration, and the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor initializes with `atomic_migration` considering `can_rollback_ddl`. It's crucial to adjust `self.output_transaction` in sqlmigrate to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to ensure it wraps the output correctly for all databases. The necessary changes should involve modifying the sqlmigrate command and possibly adding or modifying a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to assert the desired behavior.",

Specifically, the sqlmigrate command in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on the atomicity of the migration, without considering the database's ability to rollback DDL operations. This behavior can be corrected by modifying `self.output_transaction` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well. Additionally, the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` already initializes with `atomic_migration` considering `can_rollback_ddl`, which suggests that the necessary feature check is available. The ticket also suggests adding a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`, which would need to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to assert the correct behavior. The provided file context appears comprehensive for the described modifications and test additions.",
