The solution involves modifying 'sqlmigrate' to also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when deciding whether to add these statements. To address this, we need to focus our search on the 'sqlmigrate' command in Django's core management commands and related database backend features. We should also consider the 'MigrationExecutor' and 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' classes as they manage migration execution and schema editing, respectively.",

In the MigrationExecutor class, specifically in the apply_migration and unapply_migration methods, changes need to be made to consider the atomic property and the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature.\n\n2. In the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class, the __init__ method needs to be updated to properly handle the atomic_migration property based on the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature.\n\n3. The Command class in the sqlmigrate command should be updated to correctly evaluate the necessity of BEGIN/COMMIT based on both migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl.\n\nThese changes will ensure that the sqlmigrate command correctly handles the wrapping of its output in BEGIN/COMMIT based on the database's capabilities.",
