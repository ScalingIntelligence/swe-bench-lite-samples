Specifically, the command currently only considers the `atomic` property of the migration, ignoring the database's capability to rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`). To address this, the search focuses on the `sqlmigrate` command's logic to integrate `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` into the decision-making process for wrapping output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, identifying where the schema editor and its functionalities are defined or used is crucial.",

This problematic behavior is due to the current logic in 'sqlmigrate' only considering 'migration.atomic' and not 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. To address this, we need to modify 'sqlmigrate' to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' when assigning 'self.output_transaction'. Additionally, a test should be added in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to mock 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' to False. \n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. In 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py', the 'Command' class currently sets 'self.output_transaction = migration.atomic'. This logic needs to be updated to also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n2. In 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class has an attribute 'can_rollback_ddl' in its 'features' class which should be used to determine if transactions should be outputted.\n3. In 'django/db/backends/base/base.py', the 'BaseDatabaseWrapper' class is responsible for creating a schema editor, and understanding its features is crucial.\n4. In 'django/db/backends/base/features.py', the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class contains the 'can_rollback_ddl' attribute which dictates if the database supports transactional DDL.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue as they deal with the logic and features related to transactional DDL in Django's migration system.",
