The current logic only considers the atomicity of the migration, not the specific database feature of rolling back DDL. To address this, the sqlmigrate command should be modified to also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when deciding whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, a test should be added to migrations/test_commands.py to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as False and ensure the correct behavior. We should search for the `sqlmigrate` command definition and any related schema editor classes that handle DDL transactionality.",

The current logic only considers the migration's atomic attribute, but it should also consider the connection's features, specifically can_rollback_ddl. The provided search results include relevant sections from django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, django/db/backends/base/schema.py, and other files, which are crucial for understanding the current implementation and how it might be adjusted. The Command class in sqlmigrate.py defines the behavior of the sqlmigrate command and sets self.output_transaction based on the migration's atomicity. However, this logic needs to be updated to include the connection's can_rollback_ddl feature. In BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor's __init__ method in schema.py, there's the implication that the atomic_migration is determined by the capability of the connection to rollback DDL and whether the operation is atomic. This indicates where a possible adjustment could be made to resolve the issue. Additionally, examining the schema editor implementations for specific databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL provides context on how they handle DDL transactions, which is essential for addressing the issue comprehensively. Based on the analysis, the identified spans are from sqlmigrate.py and schema.py, which are directly related to the reported issue.",

The current implementation only considers the migration's atomicity and doesn't check the database's capability to rollback DDL. The solution involves altering the 'sqlmigrate' command to take 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' into account when setting 'self.output_transaction'. Additionally, a test should be added in 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to mock 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' to False.\n\nFrom the current context, the relevant code spans include how 'self.output_transaction' is set in 'Command.handle' within 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py'. However, the primary fix needs to integrate checking 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' alongside 'migration.atomic' when determining the transaction output. Specifically, the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' initialization in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' involves checking 'self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl' and setting 'self.atomic_migration' accordingly. While this context is useful, it doesn't directly address the assignment of 'self.output_transaction' in 'sqlmigrate'.\n\nGiven the new search results, critical elements include the 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' where 'self.output_transaction' is currently set based solely on 'migration.atomic'. The proposed improvement is to modify this assignment to consider both 'migration.atomic' and 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. This logic aligns with how 'atomic_migration' is handled in 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor'.\n\nRelevant extracted code spans touch on:\n1. The 'Command.handle' method where the current logic is defined.\n2. The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__' method to reference the integration of 'can_rollback_ddl' logic.\n\nThese spans provide the requisite context to understand and implement the fix as suggested by the reported issue.",

Currently, 'sqlmigrate' only checks 'migration.atomic' and not 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl', leading to the command wrapping output in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL. This issue can be addressed by modifying the 'sqlmigrate' assignment of 'self.output_transaction' to consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Additionally, a test should be added to 'tests/migrations/test_commands.py' to ensure this behavior is correctly implemented and tested. Based on the file context, the relevant file to modify is 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' where the 'handle' method of the 'Command' class needs to be updated to include the check for 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. Furthermore, 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' and 'django/db/backends/oracle/features.py' also contain relevant information about database features and capabilities that might influence this behavior. These should be reviewed and potentially adjusted in parallel with the main modification to ensure consistency and completeness. The search results confirm the presence of the 'handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py' and the 'BaseDatabaseFeatures' class in 'django/db/backends/base/features.py' with the property 'can_rollback_ddl' which defaults to False.
