The file_context provided shows the handle method in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py where self.output_transaction is set based only on migration.atomic. The search_results provide several files and spans, but the most relevant ones are in django/db/backends/base/schema.py, where the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class is defined, especially the __init__ method where atomic_migration depends on connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. This is directly related to the issue as it involves checking the database's capability to rollback DDL statements. The mysql and oracle schema files are backend-specific implementations but do not directly relate to the core issue of adjusting the sqlmigrate command to check for can_rollback_ddl.
