Focusing on the sqlmigrate command and the relevant schema editor features for the different database backends, we need to identify the exact point in code where this logic is implemented and ensure it accounts for the database's capabilities. Additionally, a test should be added to verify the behavior under non-transactional DDL conditions. Search efforts should concentrate on commands related to sqlmigrate and database schema editing, with an emphasis on how transactions are managed based on database features.",

Specifically, the sqlmigrate command's handling of transaction output and the schema editor's handling of atomic transactions are both important. The command's output_transaction assignment is currently based only on migration.atomic, which aligns with the issue's description. Additionally, the schema editor's definition of atomic_migration, which depends on can_rollback_ddl, is also relevant. The features file defines can_rollback_ddl, which indicates if the database supports transactional DDL. These sections of the code directly relate to the reported issue and provide a clear starting point for addressing it. Additional tests would need to be created as per the issue's suggestion, but that falls outside the current file context provided.",
