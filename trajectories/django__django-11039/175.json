The primary focus is on identifying where the `self.output_transaction` flag is being set and how it interacts with the database's capabilities, specifically `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant files and spans are:\n1. **django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py** - This file contains the `Command` class which is responsible for generating SQL for migrations. The `handle` method sets `self.output_transaction` based on `migration.atomic`. This should be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The `span_ids` are 'Command', 'Command.handle'. This is crucial as it directly deals with the logic that needs to be modified.\n2. **django/db/backends/base/schema.py** - This file contains the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, especially the `__init__`, `__enter__`, and `__exit__` methods, which manage the transactional behavior. The `span_ids` are 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__enter__', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__exit__'. Although these methods do not directly set `self.output_transaction`, understanding how transactions are managed in the schema editor is essential for the complete context.\n\nBoth files are essential to address the issue as they contain the logic for generating SQL for migrations and managing transactions during schema changes.",
