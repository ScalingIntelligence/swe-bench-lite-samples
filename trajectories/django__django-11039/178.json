The critical points to address are modifying the sqlmigrate command to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py. After analyzing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified in several files. In django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, the Command.handle method defines the behavior of the sqlmigrate command and sets self.output_transaction based on migration.atomic. This needs to be extended to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. In django/db/backends/base/schema.py, the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class includes the logic regarding schema editing and transaction management, particularly relevant is the __init__ method which initializes self.atomic_migration based on connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. This will be crucial for implementing changes. In django/db/migrations/executor.py, the MigrationExecutor class handles the execution of migrations, and the apply_migration method starts a transaction based on migration.atomic, which is relevant for understanding the current migration execution flow. These code spans provide the necessary context and implementation points to address the issue, including where to modify the transaction handling logic in the sqlmigrate command to also consider the database's ability to rollback DDL, and where to make corresponding changes in the schema editor and migration executor. Adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False will ensure the new functionality is tested against databases that do not support transactional DDL.",
