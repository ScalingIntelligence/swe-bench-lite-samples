This is due to the current logic in `sqlmigrate` only considering the `migration.atomic` property, not `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The proposed fix involves modifying the `sqlmigrate` command to consider both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when determining `self.output_transaction`. Additionally, a test should be added to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure non-atomic migrations with `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` set to False are correctly handled. From the provided search results, we have found relevant code in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, specifically the `Command` class and its `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is set based only on `migration.atomic`. Furthermore, in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its `__init__` method contain the logic for `self.atomic_migration`, which is set based on `self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and `atomic`. This demonstrates that the necessary feature check (`can_rollback_ddl`) and the current logic affecting `self.output_transaction` in `sqlmigrate` are aligned with the issue description. Therefore, modifying `self.output_transaction` in the `Command` class to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` should address the issue. Additionally, there is a need to add a test that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure the fix works correctly in such scenarios.",
