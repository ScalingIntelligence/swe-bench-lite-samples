This suggests that the current logic in sqlmigrate is not adequately checking for the database's capability to handle transactional DDL statements. The solution proposed involves modifying the sqlmigrate command to consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature when determining whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, a test should be added in the tests/migrations/test_commands.py to ensure this behavior is correctly implemented. Given the nature of the issue, my approach will be to pinpoint the sections of code in sqlmigrate and connection features that require adjustment. This will involve looking at how the transaction handling is currently managed in the sqlmigrate command and how the database features, specifically can_rollback_ddl, are defined and utilized.",
