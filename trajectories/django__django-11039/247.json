Specifically, it's noted that the current `sqlmigrate` logic only takes `migration.atomic` into consideration when deciding whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. The solution suggests that `sqlmigrate` should also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Given the context provided, we need to focus on the `sqlmigrate.py` file where the `sqlmigrate` command logic resides and potentially `executor.py` where the migration execution logic might be affected. Additionally, we should look into the `schema.py` files for each database backend to understand if there are any specific overrides or settings related to `can_rollback_ddl` that need to be considered.",

The search results show relevant code in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py that can be used to implement this change. In particular, the Command class in sqlmigrate.py has a handle method that sets self.output_transaction based on migration.atomic. This logic needs to be expanded to include a check for connection.features.can_rollback_ddl. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in executor.py uses the can_rollback_ddl feature within its schema_editor, indicating that this feature is relevant to the context of managing migrations. These code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and provide the necessary context to make the required modifications.",
