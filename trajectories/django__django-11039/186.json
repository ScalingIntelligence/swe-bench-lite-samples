This behavior needs to be adjusted to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in addition to the migration's atomicity. The relevant files and classes to focus on include `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, its subclasses, and the `sqlmigrate` command. The primary concern is modifying the `sqlmigrate` command's handling of `self.output_transaction` to include a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, tests should be added or modified in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to ensure this behavior is correctly tested.",

The proposed solution suggests changing the sqlmigrate command to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when deciding to wrap the output in a transaction. Additionally, it mentions adding a test to check this behavior.\n\nI analyzed the provided search results and identified several relevant code spans that handle transaction management and DDL in the context of migrations. Specifically, I focused on the `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration` method, which is responsible for applying migrations and managing transactions. This method uses `schema_editor` with the `atomic` context manager, which is a key element tied to transaction handling.\n\nAdditionally, I reviewed the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class, which contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute. This attribute determines whether the database supports rolling back DDL statements, which is crucial for the solution proposed in the issue.\n\nFinally, I examined the `sqlmigrate` command implementation within the `Command.handle` method. This method initializes the `MigrationExecutor` and sets up the connection, which is where the transaction handling decision should be modified based on `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans are in the `sqlmigrate.py`, `features.py`, and `executor.py` files, as they directly pertain to handling migrations, transaction management, and DDL capabilities of the database.",

The key elements identified in the issue are: 1) migration.atomic should be considered alongside connection.features.can_rollback_ddl, 2) a test should be added in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to mock connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False. Current context involves examining sqlmigrate command in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py and other relevant parts of the codebase such as features.py and executor.py. New search results found MigrationExecutor class in executor.py that interacts with Migration instances and handles migration application and collection of SQL statements. Additionally, Migration class in migration.py is found which defines the behavior of individual migrations and their operations. Overall, the search results are consistent with the need to modify the logic around when BEGIN/COMMIT are output in sqlmigrate based on database features, and to ensure the addition of relevant unit tests.",
