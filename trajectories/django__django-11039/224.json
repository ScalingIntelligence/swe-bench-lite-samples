This is crucial because wrapping the output in BEGIN/COMMIT when the database doesn't support transactional DDL can lead to errors. The main focus should be on the sqlmigrate command logic and how it decides whether to wrap the output in BEGIN/COMMIT. Additionally, there's a need for a new test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py to simulate the scenario where the database doesn't support rollback DDL. Given the provided context, it's clear that the MigrationExecutor and BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor are central to this issue due to their roles in managing database schema changes and transactions. Thus, searching in files related to these classes and the sqlmigrate command is essential.",

Identified key elements such as 'command.output_transaction', 'MigrationExecutor', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor', and 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n3.3. Evaluated relevance based on alignment with the reported issue.\n3.4. Found 'Command.handle' in 'sqlmigrate.py' where 'self.output_transaction' is assigned based on 'migration.atomic'. This is directly related to the issue, as it should also consider 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'.\n3.5. Found 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.__init__' in 'schema.py' where 'self.atomic_migration' is defined based on 'connection.features.can_rollback_ddl'. This is also relevant for the migration atomicity.\n3.6. Found other sections like 'Command.add_arguments', 'Command.execute', etc., which support context but are not directly relevant.\n3.7.

Specifically, the `Command` class in `sqlmigrate.py` currently sets `self.output_transaction` based solely on `migration.atomic`, and we need to update this to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `schema.py` provides the `can_rollback_ddl` feature check, which should be integrated into the `sqlmigrate` logic. No additional code spans from the search results are directly relevant to addressing the reported issue, but the context provided by the search results helps to understand how the `can_rollback_ddl` feature works and how it can be accessed from within the `sqlmigrate` command.",
