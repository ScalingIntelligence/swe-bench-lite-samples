The relevant sections of code are located in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` and `django/db/backends/base/features.py`. In `sqlmigrate.py`, the `Command` class initializes with `output_transaction = True`, and the `handle` method checks if the migration is atomic by accessing `migration.atomic`. This logic needs to be updated to include a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class in `features.py` contains the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, which is currently set to False. By analyzing both sections of code and understanding the described issue, it's clear that adjusting the `output_transaction` condition in `sqlmigrate.py` to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` would address the problem. Furthermore, there's a need to add tests to `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to validate this new behavior.",

  "initial_message": "sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nThe migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT \u200bif the migration is atomic and \u200bthe schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.\nThe issue can be addressed by\nChanging sqlmigrate \u200bassignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.\nAdding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on \u200ban existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.\nI marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.\n"
