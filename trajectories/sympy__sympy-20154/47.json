The issue notes that this behavior is confusing and can lead to subtle bugs. The objective is to determine whether it's feasible to modify this behavior to copy the dictionary before yielding it, rather than reusing it.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `partitions` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`, specifically in the 'partitions' span, where the code responsible for generating partitions and potentially reusing dictionaries is located. The detailed examination reveals that the function uses a technique to reuse dictionaries to manage memory efficiently, which is the root cause of the reported issue.\n\nOther code spans such as 'multiset_partitions', '_set_partitions', 'ordered_partitions', and 'binary_partitions' are also relevant as they handle different types of partition generation, but they do not directly address the issue related to reusing output dictionaries.\n\nGiven the issue's focus, the identified span in the 'partitions' function is central to resolving the problem, suggesting that modifications here could alleviate the reuse of dictionaries, thereby addressing the user's concerns about unexpected behavior and potential bugs. The task is not yet complete, as further detailed analysis or testing would be needed to ensure that implementing changes would not adversely affect performance or other functionalities in the module. However, based on the provided search results, implementing a change to copy the dictionary before yielding it could be a suitable solution without needing to modify unrelated sections of the module or introduce new functions.",
