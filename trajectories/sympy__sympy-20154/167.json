The current file context provided includes the entire `partitions()` function, which shows the implementation and how it yields the dictionaries. The search results also show the same `partitions()` function, indicating that no additional relevant code spans were found. The analysis of the `partitions()` function reveals that it indeed reuses the same dictionary for all yield statements, which aligns with the issue reported. Since the function involves generating partitions and reusing dictionaries could lead to unintended modifications if not handled properly, it seems appropriate to consider copying the dictionary before yielding it. The identified code spans in the file context and search results are all related to the `partitions()` function and its yielding mechanism.

It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
