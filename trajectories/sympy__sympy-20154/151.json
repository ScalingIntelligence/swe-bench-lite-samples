The current implementation reuses dictionaries, which can lead to confusing and potentially buggy behavior. The user suggests that it might be better to copy the dictionary before yielding it to avoid these issues.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, I found the relevant code span in the partitions function (span id 'partitions'). This function indeed reuses the same dictionary object, modifying its contents for each iteration. This is evident in the line 'yield ms', where ms is the dictionary being reused across iterations. This matches the concern described in the issue about reusing output dictionaries.\n\nAs a result, the 'partitions' span is identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
