This behavior is documented in the docstring but might not be necessary for performance. To locate the relevant code, we should search for the 'partitions' function in the 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py' file, and potentially other related functions like 'multiset_partitions', 'ordered_partitions', and 'binary_partitions', as they all deal with different types of partitions. Additionally, we should also check the 'IntegerPartition' class in 'sympy/combinatorics/partitions.py' and the 'partition' function in 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py' since they might also be relevant to the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is concerned with the 'partitions()' function in sympy.utilities.iterables reusing output dictionaries, which can lead to confusing behavior and potential bugs. The search results present several code spans that are relevant to the issue. Firstly, since the issue directly concerns the 'partitions()' function, the span with id 'partitions' in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py' is directly relevant. This span contains the implementation of the 'partitions()' function, which is the main focus of the issue. Next, the issue suggests that copying the dictionary before yielding might be a good solution. Therefore, examining the 'multiset_partitions()', 'ordered_partitions()', and 'binary_partitions()' functions in the same file is pertinent as these might provide insights into related partition functions and their behaviors. The 'IntegerPartition' class in 'sympy/combinatorics/partitions.py' is also noteworthy as it deals with partitions specifically and might offer additional context or utility for managing partitions in a less error-prone way. Furthermore, the 'partition()' function in 'sympy/solvers/diophantine/diophantine.py' could be valuable for understanding how partitions are handled in a different context, potentially adding complexity or clarity to the understanding of the issue. However, the 'partition()' function definitions in 'sympy/unify/core.py' and the 'GLSLPrinter._print_Add()' method in 'sympy/printing/glsl.py' are not directly relevant to the issue expressed regarding the 'partitions()' function in the context of sympy.utilities.iterables, thereby not adding significant value to resolving the specific concern.",

It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
