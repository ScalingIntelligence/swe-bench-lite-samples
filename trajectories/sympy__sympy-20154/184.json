When analyzing the code span identified by the id 'partitions', it becomes clear that this function indeed reuses the same dictionary object for its output. The function iteratively constructs partitions of the number `n` and yields them, but due to the reuse of the dictionary object, subsequent yields modify the previously yielded dictionaries, making the behavior confusing and potentially leading to subtle bugs. This directly aligns with the concerns raised in the reported issue about the performance impact of copying the dictionary and the resulting confusion in usage.
