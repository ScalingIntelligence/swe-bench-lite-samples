Directly in the search results, the `partitions()` function is found in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` with span ID 'partitions'. The function manages partitions of integers, and inside the while loop, there is a clear example of dictionary reuse when the function reuses any 1's and instances of larger keys, updating them without copying.

  "initial_message": "partitions() reusing the output dictionaries\nThe partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
