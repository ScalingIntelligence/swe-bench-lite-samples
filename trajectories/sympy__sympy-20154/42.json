This behavior is explicitly described in the code and seems to be intentional for performance reasons. However, the user suggests that copying the dictionary before yielding might be more intuitive and less error-prone, albeit slightly slower. The relevant part of the code is the `partitions()` function itself, particularly the section where dictionaries are yielded.

  "initial_message": "partitions() reusing the output dictionaries\nThe partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
