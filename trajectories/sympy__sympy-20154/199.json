The issue is that the function reuses the output dictionaries, which can lead to confusing and potentially buggy behavior when the partitions are collected, e.g., by converting the iterator to a list. Upon examining the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are within the definition of the partitions() function itself. Specifically, the function is defined to reuse the dictionary while yielding the partitions, which directly relates to the problem described in the issue. Thus, the entire code span identified by the 'partitions' span ID is relevant to address the issue. This analysis confirms the need to modify the behavior of the partitions() function to avoid dictionary reuse. This modification would involve copying the dictionary before yielding it to prevent unexpected behavior when collecting the results. Considering the current file context is empty (no relevant code identified yet), the search results have successfully identified the source of the problem and provide a clear target for modification.",
