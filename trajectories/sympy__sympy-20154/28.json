This behavior is considered problematic because it leads to confusion and potential bugs, especially when the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. The suggestion is to copy the dictionary before yielding it to avoid these issues.\n\nStep 2: Review the current file context: No relevant code has been identified yet.\n\nStep 3: Process new search results:\n- The `partitions()` function is found in the file `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`.\n- The function's implementation is provided in the span with id 'partitions'.\n- The code shows that the function yields a dictionary (`ms`) without copying it, which aligns with the described problematic behavior.\n\nStep 4: Determine relevance:\n- The `partitions()` function directly corresponds to the issue reported. The code span shows the exact location where the dictionary is reused without copying, confirming the issue.\n\nDecision: The identified code span is relevant to the reported issue, as it directly shows the problematic behavior of reusing the output dictionaries without copying.",
