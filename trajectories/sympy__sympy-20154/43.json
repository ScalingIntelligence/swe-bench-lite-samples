The issue suggests that copying the dictionary before yielding it might be a better approach to avoid these issues. Reviewing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are located in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file within the `partitions` function definition. Additionally, related functionality such as `multiset_partitions_taocp` and `MultisetPartitionTraverser` in the `sympy/utilities/enumerative.py` file may be relevant for understanding the broader context of how partitions are handled in the codebase.\n\nThe `partitions` function definition directly addresses the creation of partitions based on the input parameters. This function is the primary focus for addressing the issue as described. The `multiset_partitions_taocp` function and the `MultisetPartitionTraverser` class in `sympy/utilities/enumerative.py` are also relevant since they handle aspects of partitioning, which could indirectly involve the reuse of dictionaries or similar behaviors. These broader contexts are important for understanding how the changes in `partitions` might affect other parts of the partitioning logic in the library.",

It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
