This behavior is considered confusing and could lead to bugs. Upon examining the provided 'partitions' code in the 'iterables.py' file, it becomes evident that the function indeed yields dictionaries that are reused in subsequent iterations. For instance, the line 'yield ms' demonstrates this behavior. This aligns with the concern expressed in the issue, suggesting that modifying the function to yield a copy of the dictionary instead might alleviate the problem. However, after analyzing this specific code span within the larger context of the file, I don't find any other code in the 'search_results' that directly addresses handling copies of the output dictionaries.",
