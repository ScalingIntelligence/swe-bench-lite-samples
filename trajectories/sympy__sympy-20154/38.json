The issue suggests that the performance gain from reusing dictionaries might not be worth the confusion and potential bugs it introduces. The current context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet. Analyzing the provided search results, the most relevant code span is found within `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` under the span ID 'partitions'. This span contains the implementation of the `partitions()` function, which is directly related to the reported issue. The function's behavior of reusing output dictionaries is clearly evident in this code span, making it highly relevant to address the issue. Other search results, such as those in `sympy/utilities/enumerative.py`, `sympy/solvers/diophantine/diophantine.py`, `sympy/combinatorics/partitions.py`, `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, and `sympy/ntheory/partitions_.py`, while containing related functionalities and classes, do not directly address the reuse of output dictionaries problem in the `partitions()` function.

It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
