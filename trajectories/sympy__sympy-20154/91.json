This directly relates to the issue described, as it confirms that the function indeed reuses the same dictionary object across different iterations.\n\nThe code span identified as the specific concern is the section where the function yields the dictionary (ms). This part of the code either yields the dictionary ms directly or with a size wrapped around it. Neither approach involves copying the dictionary before yielding, which is likely where the confusion and potential for bugs arise.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code span to address the issue is clearly the part where the function yields the reused dictionary.
