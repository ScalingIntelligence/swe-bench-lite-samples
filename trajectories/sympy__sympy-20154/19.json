By examining the provided code span labeled 'partitions', it is clear that the function indeed reuses the same dictionary object for each yield, which explains the behavior described in the issue. This reuse can be problematic, especially when users expect each yielded partition to be independent. Given this context, the focus should be on identifying the specific parts of the code that handle the dictionary yielding and reusing for potential modification. The relevant part of the code is where the dictionary 'ms' is yielded within the while loop at the end of the function. The rest of the code is setup and calculations for generating partitions, but the actual yielding of results occurs in the final conditional statements of the while loop. Since the issue directly pertains to the yielding mechanism of dictionaries, the 'partitions' code span is the only relevant part needed to address this issue.",

There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
