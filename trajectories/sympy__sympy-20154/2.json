Specifically, the while loop and the conditions involving the use of dictionaries (ms and keys) within the partitions function are crucial to the functionality mentioned in the issue.\n\nGiven the strong match between the location and functionality of the partitions() function in the search results with the description in the reported issue, it is clear that the relevant code spans are those involved in defining and operating the partitions() function, particularly where it involves reusing dictionaries.
