Analyzing the 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py' file, the 'partitions' span specifically addresses the implementation of the 'partitions()' function. This is directly related to the issue as the function is the subject of concern and its behavior regarding dictionary reuse is explicitly noted. The docstring and the function's yield statement, where it potentially reuses dictionaries, is crucial for understanding and addressing the problem. Hence, it's imperative to focus on this specific span to initiate any required modifications to resolve the issue. There is no need to consider other spans or files at this stage because the current focus is on correcting the improper reuse of dictionaries within a single function. Further actions may require analyzing or changing other parts of the code depending on the solution's implementation, after addressing this immediate concern. For now, concentration on the identified span will help in drafting a potential fix or proposing alternate methods that could be integrated across broader scope if necessary.",

There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
