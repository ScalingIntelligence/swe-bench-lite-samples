To address this, it's necessary to identify the section of code where this behavior occurs. The search results contain a span labeled 'partitions' in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`, which appears to be the relevant code for the `partitions()` function. Additionally, other sections in the same file and related files could also be relevant for a comprehensive understanding. The issue suggests that copying the dictionary before yielding it might resolve the problem, so the specific yield statements or the logic around dictionary generation and reuse should be closely examined. The presence of related functions and classes like `MultisetPartitionTraverser` in `sympy/utilities/enumerative.py` might also offer insights into the broader context of partition handling in the codebase, potentially pointing to interactions or shared behaviors that could influence the issue at hand.",
