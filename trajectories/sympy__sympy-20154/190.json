The search results provided include the partitions function definition within sympy/utilities/iterables.py. This function is directly related to the reported issue as it involves the reuse of dictionaries for generating partitions. The function checks for invalid inputs, calculates partitions, and yields dictionaries that represent these partitions. The problematic behavior, as described in the issue, is likely occurring within the while loop where the function reuses or modifies dictionaries without creating new copies for each yield. This analysis suggests that the entire partitions function is relevant to address the issue of dictionary reuse.",
