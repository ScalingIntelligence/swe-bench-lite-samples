The docstring of the function acknowledges this caveat. The issue hints at the possibility that copying the dictionary before yielding it might be a preferable approach to avoid these complications. Given the focus of the issue, the relevant code to investigate is the partitions() function itself, which is indeed present in the search results under the sympy/utilities/iterables.py file.

The part that involves yielding the partitions directly could be of particular interest for potential modifications to address the issue.",
