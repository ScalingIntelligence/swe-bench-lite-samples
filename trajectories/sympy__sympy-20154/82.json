There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n"
