These files contain relevant code spans that manage HTTP connections and handle various socket-related errors, such as 'SocketTimeout' and 'SocketError'. Specifically, the '_make_request' method in 'HTTPConnectionPool' class in 'connectionpool.py' captures 'SocketError' and 'SocketTimeout' and raises a 'ReadTimeoutError'. There is also a reference to handling the 'SocketError' for specific error numbers, which aligns with the issue of handling socket errors in the context of HTTP requests. These code spans are highly relevant to address the reported issue by ensuring that socket errors are wrapped in a higher-level 'requests' exception, which can be implemented based on the existing reference to handling socket errors in this method.",
