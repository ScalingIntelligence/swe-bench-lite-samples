To address this, we need to identify the points in the code where socket errors can occur and ensure they are properly caught and wrapped in the appropriate requests exception. In the search results, several code spans are relevant:\n\n1. In requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py, the `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method handles various exceptions including `SocketError`, which is thrown when there is a connection issue. This method handles the exception but does not wrap it in a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. This part of the code is highly relevant as it directly deals with handling errors during URL opening.\n\n2. In requests/packages/urllib3/response.py, the `HTTPResponse.read` method catches `SocketTimeout` and `BaseSSLError`, which also points to areas where network-related errors can occur. This method is also relevant as it handles reading data from the network and exception handling.\n\nThese identified spans provide the necessary context where the socket-related exceptions are caught and could potentially be wrapped in a Requests exception like ConnectionError. This approach will make the exception handling more consistent with the expectations of Requests library users.",
