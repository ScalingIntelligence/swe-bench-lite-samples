The `HTTPConnection` class in `connection.py` handles socket connection details and could potentially be where additional exception wrapping is needed. In `connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool` class and its methods (`_make_request`, `urlopen`) deal with making HTTP requests and handling exceptions, including socket errors. Specifically, the `_make_request` method catches `SocketError` and could be extended to raise a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` with the original `SocketError` as its cause. This approach would align with the user's expectation that socket errors be wrapped in a more specific `requests` exception.",

The method `_make_request` is of particular interest as it directly handles the request process and possible exceptions, including socket errors. The method includes a catch for `SocketError` and reraises it, which aligns with the issue's concern. However, the specific error reported (`socket.error with [Errno 104]`) is not explicitly handled by wrapping it in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

The presence of `BaseSSLError`, `SocketError`, and `HTTPException` handling within the `HTTPConnectionPool` class demonstrates the library's capability to handle lower-level errors and potentially translate them into higher-level exceptions. However, there is no explicit mapping of a `socket.error` with `[Errno 104]` to a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

The provided file context and search results primarily focus on the 'connectionpool.py' file, which contains critical components related to handling HTTP connections, including the handling of socket errors within the '_make_request' and 'urlopen' methods. Notably, the HTTPConnectionPool class in 'connectionpool.py' includes mechanisms for managing connection retries and timeouts, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'exceptions.py' file contains the definition of ConnectionError, the ideal exception type for wrapping socket errors. These sections of code provide a clear entry point for addressing the issue by integrating the handling of socket errors within the ConnectionError exception. The analysis of the provided code sections indicates that the current handling of socket errors is not encapsulated within a specific requests exception, aligning perfectly with the reported issue.
