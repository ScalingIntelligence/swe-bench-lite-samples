However, there isn't a specific block to catch raw socket.error exceptions and transform them into a more specific requests exception like ConnectionError. This is also evident in the '_make_request' method of the 'HTTPConnectionPool' class, where multiple types of exceptions, including SocketError, are caught but not wrapped into a more specific requests exception before being shipped back to the main requests library code. These are the specific locations where improvements should be implemented to address the gaps identified in catching raw socket errors.",

            "scratch_pad": "First, the issue is about handling a raw socket error when a socket is reset, and expecting it to be caught and wrapped in a requests exception like `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The traceback indicates where the error occurs (specifically in socket.recv), and the current handling paths discussed include SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, and HTTPException. There was an indication that a NetworkError or ConnectionError from 'requests' was expected instead. I shall review new search results to check if there are better error-handling practices or existing implementations that could be a reference for the exception handling redesign.\n\nReviewing the new search results, it's clear that: \n1. The `requests.exceptions` module has a hierarchy starting from `RequestException`, which includes `ConnectionError` and various specific exceptions. This hierarchy looks suitable for adapting to wrap socket errors.  \n2. Existing logic in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' should be inspected closely to see if improvements are needed to catch and wrap socket errors.\n3. Since the reported issue might not have a direct solution, one of the code spans from 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', that deal with SocketTimeout or BaseSSLError, could be targeted to understand how to adjust them or add features for catching other network-related exceptions like raw socket errors.",

This suggests a need to catch socket.error exceptions and re-raise them as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. \n\nAnalyzing the provided file contexts and search results, several key areas are relevant: \n1. **requests/packages/urllib3/response.py**: The HTTPResponse class's `read` method catches SocketTimeout and HTTPException but does not explicitly catch socket.error. \n2. **requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py**: The HTTPConnectionPool class's `urlopen` method catches various exceptions including SocketError, but does not explicitly handle socket.error. \n3. **requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py**: The HTTPConnection class's `_new_conn` method potentially raises a SocketTimeout, but similar handling for socket.error is absent. \n\nTo address the issue, modifications should be made to these code sections to catch socket.error and raise a more appropriate requests exception such as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError.",
