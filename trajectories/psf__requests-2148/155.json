This is a potential bug in how the requests library handles lower-level socket errors. To address this, we need to identify which part of the requests library or dependent libraries might be directly dealing with socket operations and ensure that these operations have appropriate exception handling to wrap socket errors in higher-level exceptions like requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. The traceback suggests that the error occurs in the HTTP response handling part of the library. We should focus our search on modules dealing with HTTP connections, responses, and streaming operations.",

Notably, 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' directly addresses the handling of 'SocketTimeout' and 'HTTPException' in the 'read' method of 'HTTPResponse', suggesting a potential point where 'socket.error' could be integrated. Meanwhile, 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' includes safeguards against 'SocketTimeout' and 'SocketError' in '_make_request', indicating another area for potential enhancement regarding error handling.

This suggests a need to examine the handling of socket-related errors within the requests library. The provided search results offer insights into how the `HTTPConnectionPool` and `HTTPSConnectionPool` classes manage connections, including the handling of timeouts and errors. The `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method, in particular, handles several types of errors including `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `SocketError`. However, it does not explicitly handle raw `socket.error` exceptions and does not wrap them in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This omission aligns with the reported issue. Further, examination of the `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method also reveals error handling for various cases, but again, no specific handling for raw `socket.error` exceptions. The `HTTPSConnectionPool` implementations extend these functionalities for HTTPS connections. Hence, it appears essential to modify the error handling in these methods to include a catch for `socket.error` and to wrap it in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` to address the issue effectively.",

We should focus on refining the error handling in these areas to ensure that all socket.error exceptions are caught and handled properly.

The _make_request method in HTTPConnectionPool is a critical spot to check for and handle socket errors, as it directly interacts with the underlying socket operations. Additionally, the connect method in HTTPSConnection is relevant for handling socket errors during the connection setup.

This is in line with the reported issue, indicating that not all socket errors are caught and processed appropriately. The current error handling in the `read` method of `HTTPResponse` class and within `HTTPConnectionPool` focuses on specific errors (like timeouts and SSL errors) but does not uniformly handle all possible `SocketError` exceptions.
