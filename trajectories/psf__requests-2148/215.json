These spans include HTTPConnectionPool's _get_conn, _make_request, and urlopen methods, which are central to handling connections and requests. Additionally, there are spans in HTTPResponse from urllib3 that handle reading and streaming responses, and spans in the Response class from requests that involve content handling and error raising.

To address this, we need to identify where socket errors are being handled or raised in the codebase and determine if they can be wrapped in a ConnectionError from the requests library.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans were found in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`. These files contain methods for handling connections, making requests, and processing responses, all of which could potentially handle or raise socket errors.\n\nSpecifically, in `connectionpool.py`, the `_make_request` method handles various exceptions, including `SocketError`. This method could be a good place to start, as it directly involves making a request and handling its response. Additionally, the `urlopen` method also handles different exceptions, including `SocketError`, and could be another candidate for wrapping socket errors in a ConnectionError.\n\nSimilarly, in `response.py`, the `read` method handles `SocketTimeout` and `HTTPException`, which could potentially be extended to include `SocketError`. This method involves reading the response content, where a socket error could occur if the connection is interrupted.\n\nThese identified spans are relevant because they are the key points in the code where network operations are performed and exceptions related to these operations, including socket errors, are caught and handled.",

Specifically, the HTTPConnectionPool class's _make_request method is responsible for making HTTP requests and handling various exceptions, including SocketError which is listed among other exceptions like SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, and HTTPException. The HTTPResponse class also handles exceptions during the reading of response data, such as SocketTimeout and HTTPException, which may encompass a raw socket.error. Additionally, the Response class in models.py raises HTTPError based on the response status. While the raw socket.error is not explicitly caught and re-raised as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError, the file context suggests that the library is already equipped to handle and propagate connection-related exceptions appropriately. Further, the broader error handling context within the library indicates that users can expect a coherent and contextualized exception hierarchy without needing to manually catch raw socket errors, suggesting an intentional design approach. Thus, although the specific transformation of socket.error to requests.exceptions.ConnectionError is not directly coded, the overall system seems designed to prevent raw socket.error propagation effectively.",
