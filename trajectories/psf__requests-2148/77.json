Given the stack trace and the nature of the error, it's clear that the error handling within the 'requests' library might not be adequately wrapping socket errors into its own ConnectionError. To address this, we should search for areas where socket.error might be raised and not properly wrapped within the 'requests' or 'urllib3' packages. The search should focus on the 'models.py', 'connectionpool.py', 'connection.py', 'response.py', and 'adapters.py' files within the 'requests' package, as these files are central to the processing of HTTP requests and responses.",

Specifically, the 'models.py' file includes the 'iter_content' and 'content' methods which are involved in streaming and handling the content of HTTP responses.

This implies a need to ensure that socket errors are properly handled and transformed into appropriate requests exceptions within the codebase. \n\nReviewing the provided code spans, particularly in `requests/adapters.py`, there is a clear section in the `HTTPAdapter.send` method where socket errors are caught and appropriately raised as `ConnectionError`. This handling directly addresses the issue, ensuring that the raw `socket.error` gets transformed into a requests-specific `ConnectionError`. This behavior aligns with the requirements specified in the reported issue. \n\nGiven this, the identified span in `requests/adapters.py` (span_id: HTTPAdapter.send) is considered relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue.
