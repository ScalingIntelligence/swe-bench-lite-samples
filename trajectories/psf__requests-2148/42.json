Given the stack trace and the provided context, it is clear that the error originates from the interaction between various components of the 'requests' library and its dependent libraries like 'urllib3' and 'gevent'. To resolve this, we need to identify where the socket errors are occurring in the library and ensure they are properly caught and wrapped in 'ConnectionError'. We should focus our search on the 'requests/models.py', 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' files since these are where the HTTP response processing and connection handling occur.",

An examination of the provided search results reveals several pertinent code spans that map closely to handling and managing responses, content, and streaming operations, which may involve network-related errors. Notably, the Response class in 'requests/models.py' includes methods like 'iter_content' and 'content' that directly interact with network data, potentially exposing unhandled socket errors. Additionally, the HTTPResponse class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' shows operations like 'stream' and 'read', which are also likely areas where socket errors can emerge. The HTTPConnectionPool class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' is also examined as it handles connection management, where network exceptions, including socket errors, may be encountered. These specific spans of code are of high relevance as they touch areas directly related to the handling of network responses and connection management that are tightly linked to the described issue. Given these matches, it is clear that the task of identifying where socket errors need to be more explicitly caught and wrapped in requests' exceptions intersects significantly with the functionality exposed in these code spans.",

I reviewed the current context and then processed new search results to identify relevant code spans. The reported issue points out that when a socket reset occurs, it is raised as a raw socket error instead of a requests exception. This suggests a lack of appropriate exception handling in the relevant sections of the codebase. From the search results, the spans related to handling content (iter_content and content methods in Response class from requests/models.py), reading from the response (read method in HTTPResponse class from requests/packages/urllib3/response.py), and establishing connection (methods like _get_conn, _make_request in HTTPConnectionPool class from requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py) are most likely to be relevant for addressing this issue. These sections involve critical parts of the code where network errors might occur, and they need to ensure that socket errors are properly caught and wrapped in requests exceptions. Therefore, I identified these spans as relevant for addressing the reported issue.",

Specifically, 'requests/models.py', 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' contain methods that manage HTTP connections, responses, and exceptions handling. The issue of 'socket.error' not being caught and wrapped in a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError' is relevant to these files, as they deal with the handling of socket errors and exceptions during HTTP requests. Further examination of the code shows that while the 'requests' library does handle some exceptions such as 'SocketTimeout', 'BaseSSLError', and 'HTTPException', it does not explicitly handle 'socket.error' in the way described in the issue. This suggests that the relevant code to address the issue can be found within the existing structure, but additional handling for 'socket.error' specifically would need to be added. Given this, the task can be considered as needing more work since the solution would require implementing a new exception handling case for 'socket.error' in these files.",
