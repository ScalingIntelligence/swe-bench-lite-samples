This task involves identifying areas in the code where socket errors might be raised and ensuring they are wrapped or re-raised as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans, the most relevant areas of concern are where socket errors could potentially occur, such as in the connection establishment and data reading processes. Key sections observed include:\n\n1. `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`: Specifically the `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPSConnection` classes, which are responsible for establishing connections and might raise socket errors.\n2. `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`: The `HTTPResponse` class, particularly its `read` method, where data is read from the connection and could encounter socket errors like `SocketTimeout`.\n3. `requests/adapters.py`: The `HTTPAdapter` class's `send` method, which handles sending requests and could raise socket errors that need to be caught and appropriately handled.\n\nThese sections are crucial as they directly involve network operations prone to socket errors. By carefully examining these code spans, we can pinpoint where the wrapping of socket errors in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` should be implemented or adjusted to address the reported issue.",

However, there is no explicit mention of 'ConnectionResetError', which is a specific type of socket error. Nevertheless, the general approach to handling and wrapping socket errors in this code should cover the scenario mentioned in the issue. Further, the 'response.py' file handles exceptions like 'ReadTimeoutError', 'ProtocolError', and 'DecodeError', which suggests robust exception handling within the library.
