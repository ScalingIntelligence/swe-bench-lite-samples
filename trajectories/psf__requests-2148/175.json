Therefore, the focus should be on identifying the parts of the codebase where socket errors might be raised and not caught or wrapped appropriately. The search should primarily target the files and methods involved in handling HTTP requests and responses, with a specific focus on error handling.",

To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans where this functionality might be implemented or enhanced. First, I reviewed the 'requests/exceptions.py' file to find the definition of `ConnectionError`. This class is indeed defined under 'requests/exceptions.py' and inherits from `RequestException`. It seems like a relevant place to start for understanding how exceptions are propagated and wrapped within the `requests` library. Additionally, I examined the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' file, as it directly involves connections and defines a `VerifiedHTTPSConnection` class with a `connect` method. This method could potentially handle socket errors. Within the same file, I noted the span for socket-related imports which shows the integration of socket functionality with the HTTPConnection. Lastly, since the issue extends to how exceptions from urllib3 are handled within the `requests` framework, I checked the 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file. Here, I found definitions for `ConnectionError` and other relevant exceptions that might be invoked upon encountering socket issues. Based on this analysis, the identified spans should cover the locations in the codebase where adjustments to catch and propagate socket errors as `ConnectionError` exceptions would need to be made.",

The traceback indicates that the error is occurring at the socket level, specifically in the `recv` method of `gevent.socket`. This suggests that the error handling mechanism in the requests library might be bypassed, leading to the raw socket error being exposed to the user.\n\nFrom the file context, we see that the `requests` library defines various exceptions including `ConnectionError` which inherits from `RequestException`. The search results provide more context on how the requests library processes responses and handles connections, specifically in the `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` file. This file contains classes and methods that manage HTTP responses, including decoding content, managing headers, and handling connections. Notably, there are spans that deal with reading responses and handling decoders, which could potentially be where the error originates from.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it seems crucial to ensure that any socket-level errors during HTTP response handling are caught and appropriately wrapped in the defined exceptions within the requests library. The spans in the `HTTPResponse` class, such as `__init__`, `read`, and `close`, appear to be relevant as they handle the HTTP response lifecycle, which coincides with where the error occurs in the traceback.\n\nIt is important to verify if these methods already have error handling for socket or connection issues and if they correctly raise the appropriate `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

The `HTTPResponse` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` handles socket timeouts and SSL errors, which are related to the issue of not catching `socket.error`. The `RequestException` hierarchy in `requests/exceptions.py` defines `ConnectionError`, which is the appropriate exception to wrap `socket.error`. While the specific handling of `socket.error` isn't explicitly shown in the `generate` or `stream` methods in `requests/models.py`, the broader context provided suggests that these methods should and likely do handle such errors.
