This suggests the need to enhance error handling in the relevant parts of the codebase to ensure that socket errors are appropriately captured and converted into requests exceptions.\n\nReviewing the current file context, there are parts of the code that handle exceptions, but it appears that there's room for improvement in catching and transforming raw socket errors like 'socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer'. This should ideally be caught and raised as a more specific requests exception.\n\nThe search results include several files and code spans that are relevant to this issue, particularly in the handling of HTTP connections and exceptions. The sections in 'connectionpool.py' and 'connection.py' are pertinent as they deal with the initiation and handling of HTTP connections, including the potential for socket errors during these operations. The 'adapters.py' file is also relevant as it manages the HTTP and HTTPS requests through an adapter mechanism, which should ideally incorporate robust exception handling for errors originating from the lower-level socket operations.\n\nFrom these search results, specific spans in 'connection.py' and 'connectionpool.py' are identified as particularly relevant. These include the '_new_conn' method in 'connection.py', which is responsible for creating new connections, and the 'urlopen' method in 'connectionpool.py', which manages the opening of URLs, including handling retries and various exceptions that can occur during this process. Enhancing the error handling in these methods, particularly around the instantiation and usage of socket connections, should help address the reported issue.",

Additionally, check for custom exception handling in `requests` that might wrap `urllib3` exceptions.",

The `Retry` class in `urllib3` and the `HTTPConnectionPool` class handle a variety of exceptions, including `SocketError`, `SocketTimeout`, and `HTTPException`, among others. However, the transformation of `socket.error` into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` directly isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippets. To determine where this transformation occurs, we need to: 1. Look into the `Retry` class and its interactions with other classes to see if it handles `socket.error` and possibly transforms it. 2. Inspect the `HTTPConnectionPool` class for any exception handling that translates low-level network errors into higher-level exceptions, especially focusing on `urlopen` and `_make_request` methods. 3. Check the integration points between `requests` and `urllib3` to see if any additional exception mapping or wrapping takes place.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the handling of socket.error exceptions within the requests library. Specifically, it mentions that under certain conditions, a socket reset results in a raw socket.error being raised instead of being wrapped in a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. The traceback provided shows that the error originates from the socket library's recv method within a response handling context. This indicates a need to review the connection and response handling logic in the requests library to ensure that socket errors are properly caught and converted to a more appropriate exception, such as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError.\n\nThe current context and the newly provided search results are extensive and cover multiple files and sections of the requests library, including connection management, retries, and response handling. The relevant files identified include 'requests/adapters.py', 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', and 'requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py'. These files are central to the handling of HTTP requests and responses, including the management of connections and exception handling.\n\nWithin these files, the HTTPAdapter class in 'requests/adapters.py' is crucial as it orchestrates the sending of requests and the handling of connections. The 'HTTPConnectionPool' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' manages the pool of connections and is where much of the logic for making HTTP requests is implemented. The 'Retry' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py' handles the logic for retries, which is closely related to error handling. These components collectively determine how socket errors and other exceptions are handled during the lifecycle of an HTTP request.\n\nThe newly identified code spans in 'requests/adapters.py' include the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method which initiates the sending of a request. This method is a key point to start reviewing for potential improvements in exception handling, particularly focusing on how socket errors from underlying libraries are managed and if they can be wrapped into a more specific requests exception like ConnectionError.",

However, the transformation of `socket.error` into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` directly isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippets. To determine where this transformation occurs, we need to: 1. Look into the `Retry` class and its interactions with other classes to see if it handles `socket.error` and possibly transforms it. 2. Inspect the `HTTPConnectionPool` class for any exception handling that translates low-level network errors into higher-level exceptions, especially focusing on `urlopen` and `_make_request` methods. 3. Check the integration points between `requests` and `urllib3` to see if any additional exception mapping or wrapping takes place.",
