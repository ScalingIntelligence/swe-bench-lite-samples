            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that a raw socket error (socket.error) is being raised instead of being wrapped in a requests exception (e.g., requests.exceptions.ConnectionError). This issue can be traced to how errors are handled during the HTTP request process in the `requests` library. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the following key points emerge: \n1. The `requests/packages/urllib3/util/connection.py` file contains functions that involve socket operations such as `create_connection` and `is_connection_dropped`. These functions handle socket errors directly but do not explicitly wrap them in higher-level exceptions like `requests.ConnectionError`. Given the context, this file is likely where modifications need to be made to catch and wrap socket errors appropriately. \n2. The `requests/adapters.py` file, specifically within the `HTTPAdapter.send` method, also handles socket errors by raising `ConnectionError` directly from `socket.error`. This indicates that the current implementation does catch socket errors but might not be consistently or clearly handling all cases, possibly leading to the raw socket error surfacing. \nBased on these findings, the identified relevant code spans primarily lie in the handling of socket errors in both `urllib3/util/connection.py` and `adapters.py`.",

This suggests a need to identify where socket errors are being raised in the codebase and ensure they are appropriately caught and wrapped in a ConnectionError exception. The code spans provided in the search results show various places in the code where socket errors could potentially occur. Notably, the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method in 'requests/adapters.py' already catches socket.error and raises a ConnectionError, which seems to address part of the issue. However, it's crucial to review other portions of the code where socket errors might be raised directly, such as in 'HTTPConnection._new_conn'. Since the existing handling in 'HTTPAdapter.send' aligns with the desired behavior, further attention should be given to ensuring similar handling across all relevant parts of the codebase to prevent raw socket errors from surfacing directly in application code.",
