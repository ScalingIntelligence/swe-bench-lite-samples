The relevant files to investigate would be those within the `requests` module that handle HTTP responses and connections, including `requests/models.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, and possibly files related to exceptions handling such as `requests/exceptions.py`. The search should focus on finding where socket errors are handled or where they might slip through uncaught, especially within methods that interact with the network or process response data.",

This suggests that the code's error handling mechanism is not properly wrapping low-level socket errors into higher-level requests exceptions such as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. The relevant code spans in the search results that could affect this behavior are primarily located in the `requests/models.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` files. In `requests/models.py`, the `Response.iter_content` and `Response.content` methods are important as they handle the content of the HTTP response and might need to be adjusted to catch socket errors appropriately. In `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, the `HTTPResponse.read` and `HTTPResponse.stream` methods are crucial, as these methods deal directly with reading and streaming response data, which can potentially raise socket errors. Additionally, the `HTTPResponse.__init__` method initializes the response object, which might also need adjustments to ensure proper error handling. The `requests/exceptions.py` file lists various exceptions including `ConnectionError`, which is the high-level exception that should be raised in response to a low-level socket error.",

There is a need to ensure that socket errors, such as `socket.error`, are caught and appropriately wrapped into a requests exception, like `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, rather than being allowed to propagate raw. Additionally, it's crucial to investigate how `ConnectionError` is defined and used throughout the library to maintain consistency in error handling.

Steps to address this include adding a catch for `socket.error` in `HTTPAdapter.send` and possibly wrapping it in a `ConnectionError` for consistency with other exceptions.",

Additionally, the `send` method in `requests/adapters.py` demonstrates specific handling of `socket.error`, raising a `ConnectionError` which aligns with the issue's request for wrapping raw socket errors.
