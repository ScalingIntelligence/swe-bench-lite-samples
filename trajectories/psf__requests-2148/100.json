The traceback indicates the error occurs in the context of handling an HTTP request, and it involves interactions with sockets and urllib3. The search results include several files from the urllib3 package, which is the underlying library used by requests for handling HTTP requests and connections. These files handle various aspects of HTTP connections, including socket handling, connection pooling, and response reading. The HTTPConnection class in urllib3/connection.py handles the creation of new connections, which might be relevant to catching and wrapping socket errors. Additionally, the WrappedSocket class in urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py handles specific socket operations in a wrapper, potentially being a place to implement error wrapping. The HTTPResponse class in urllib3/response.py deals with handling the response data, and might also be relevant if responses can contain errors related to socket operations. Finally, the HTTPAdapter class in requests/adapters.py is responsible for sending requests and handling connections, making it potentially relevant for catching and handling such errors in the higher-level requests library context.",
