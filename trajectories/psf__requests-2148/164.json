In the search results, several key areas are identified:\n1. The Response class in `requests/models.py` includes methods for content handling and iteration which could be where the socket error occurs, notably `iter_content` and `content`.\n2. The HTTPResponse class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` handles low-level reading of response bodies and could also be a source of the error. Methods like `stream`, `read`, and the handling of SocketTimeout and BaseSSLError in `read` are particularly relevant.\nThese code spans are relevant as they directly handle the content and errors that could relate to the socket error described in the issue. They also provide potential points for implementing or updating error wrapping to better handle exceptions like ConnectionError.",

To address this, I need to identify sections of code where socket errors might not be properly handled or wrapped. In the provided search results, I see significant relevant sections in the 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' files. Specifically, the 'iter_content' method in the Response class and the 'read' method in the HTTPResponse class are critical for handling the content of HTTP responses, including potential socket errors. These methods should ideally catch socket errors and re-raise them as more specific requests exceptions. Both sections already catch and handle various exceptions, but might lack specific handling for socket errors related to connection resets. Identifying these spans of code will help in understanding and potentially modifying the exception handling to better manage socket errors.",

The `iter_content` method manages the streaming of response content and uses `self.raw.stream`, which could potentially raise `socket.error` if there's an issue with the underlying network socket. Similarly, the `read` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` handles the reading of response content and also interacts with the network layer. Both methods catch and handle various exceptions related to network issues, content decoding, and timeouts, but they do not explicitly catch `socket.error`.

The traceback provided indicates that a raw socket.error was raised when a socket reset occurred, whereas it would be more appropriate to handle this with a requests-specific exception.\n\nReviewing the current file context, there are already identified spans of code in `requests/models.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`. These code spans include various methods related to handling responses within the `requests` library.\n\nOpening the new search results, I examine the `requests/adapters.py` file. This file contains the `HTTPAdapter` class, which is responsible for managing connections and handling the HTTP transactions. Particular attention is given to the `send` method, as it's involved with dispatching the request and handling the connection settings like timeouts and certificates.\n\nIn `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool` class and its methods are analyzed, especially the `_make_request` method, as it directly interacts with connections and could catch/wrap exceptions like socket errors.\n\nThese new findings in `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` are relevant to the task as they address potential exception handling points where a socket error could be wrapped in a requests exception. This helps in identifying where the improvements might be needed to catch and wrap these exceptions appropriately.",
