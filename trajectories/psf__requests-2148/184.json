This suggests that the error handling in the code where network requests are being made might be insufficient or incorrect. Since the stack trace points to a specific python file and line number within a function handling network requests, it would be beneficial to focus the search on that particular file and trace where the request is being made and how it is being handled. Also, since this issue is specifically about the exception handling related to network requests using the 'requests' library, the focus should be on the library's implementation of handling network connections and the associated error handling mechanisms.",

To address this, we need to look for places where socket errors might be occurring and ensure they are caught and appropriately handled. The search results contain several relevant files under the requests package, specifically in `requests/packages/urllib3`. The `HTTPConnectionPool` class in `connectionpool.py` handles HTTP connections and might be a suitable place to add exception handling for socket errors. Additionally, the `HTTPConnection` class in `connection.py` where connections are actually made could also be a critical point for catching and wrapping socket errors. Moreover, the `urlopen` method in these classes is directly related to making HTTP requests and handling their responses, making it a logical place to look for where socket errors could occur and be handled. By focusing on these spans, we can identify the existing code that initiates and manages these connections and decide how to modify them to better handle potential socket errors.",
