This suggests that the error handling within the `requests` library might be incomplete or incorrectly implemented. Given the issue, the focus should be on the places within the `requests` library where socket errors could occur and where these errors should be caught and wrapped. The search results indicate several key areas where this might be happening: 1. In `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, the `connect` methods of `HTTPConnection`, `HTTPSConnection`, and `VerifiedHTTPSConnection` classes perform low-level socket operations that could raise `socket.error`. 2. In `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method is responsible for managing connections and could encounter socket errors during connection attempts or data transfers. 3. The `PoolManager.urlopen` and `ProxyManager.urlopen` methods in `requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py` also manage connection pools and could potentially pass through uncaught socket errors. Thus, the relevant code spans from these files and methods should be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that all `socket.error` instances are caught and properly wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.",

The `connectionpool.py` file extends these with connection pooling functionalities, which include retry mechanisms and error handling for various exceptions, including `SocketError` and `BaseSSLError`. Notably, `SocketError` is caught and re-thrown as a `ProtocolError` or a `ReadTimeoutError`, suggesting that the existing codebase already takes steps to handle socket errors and map them to higher-level exceptions. However, the specific `socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer` is not explicitly caught and wrapped into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Given the detailed error handling present in `urllib3`, it is reasonable to believe that similar handling might be extended to cover this specific case in the broader `requests` library context. Further exploration in the `requests` library source code is needed to confirm this.",

The provided context includes files from the `requests` and `urllib3` libraries where connections are initiated and managed.

The current codebase analysis reveals that socket errors are currently not caught or specifically wrapped in requests exceptions like ConnectionError in certain parts of the code. For instance, in the `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method, several exceptions including `SocketError` are caught, but they are not wrapped into a requests exception. This suggests that interventions are needed to ensure that socket errors are properly caught and wrapped in a requests exception such as ConnectionError to provide a more unified and expected error handling experience. Relevant code spans have been identified that require attention to address this issue.",

Specifically, the `connectionpool.py` file within `requests/packages/urllib3/` contains methods for handling various exceptions, including `SocketError` and `BaseSSLError`. The `HTTPConnectionPool` class in this file is where network-related errors such as `SocketError` are caught and potentially transformed into higher-level exceptions like `ReadTimeoutError` or `ProtocolError`. Also, the `connection.py` file, while not directly showing the handling of `socket.error` being wrapped into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, does define the base classes for HTTP and HTTPS connections, suggesting that error handling logic would be expected to be present in methods like `connect()` that are not fully shown here. Overall, while the exact handling of `socket.error` transforming into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is not explicitly demonstrated, the context provided suggests that the relevant codebase areas for such handling are indeed included, indicating that the provided code snippets are likely relevant to the issue at hand.",
