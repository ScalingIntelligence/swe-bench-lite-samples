This inconsistency suggests that there might be code where socket errors are not properly wrapped in a requests exception. We should search for instances where socket errors can occur and ensure they are handled within the context of the 'requests' library. Given the specificity of the issue, it's essential to focus on the 'requests' library files and know what files have been provided as context. The relevant files provided include ones from 'requests', 'urllib3', and 'socket' handling, all necessary to explore how the exception may be missed and where it needs to be properly wrapped in a ConnectionError.",

To address this, we need to identify relevant code spans that deal with exception handling or the definition of exceptions in the requests library. The search results contain several key spans in the 'requests/exceptions.py' file, including 'ConnectionError' which is a specific exception class provided by the requests library. This class is a subclass of 'RequestException', making it a suitable candidate for wrapping raw socket errors. Additionally, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file contains a 'ProtocolError' class which is aliased as 'ConnectionError' in this context, suggesting that this could also be relevant for handling connection-related errors. These findings suggest that updating exception handling to use 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError' (or related classes from urllib3) would be a suitable approach to address the reported issue.",

This is the exception type we want to use to wrap socket errors.\n\nIn the search results, we see several relevant files and code spans:\n\n1. In `requests/models.py`, the `Response.iter_content` method handles streaming content, and it includes try-except blocks around `self.raw.stream`. One of the except blocks catches `IncompleteRead` and raises `ChunkedEncodingError`. Another catches `DecodeError` and raises `ContentDecodingError`. These are both subclasses of `RequestException`, but we need to ensure that socket errors are also caught and wrapped in `ConnectionError`.\n\n2. In `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, the `HTTPResponse.read` method reads data and includes multiple except blocks for various exceptions like `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `HTTPException`, but does not specifically mention wrapping socket errors in `ConnectionError`. This is a potential area where the socket error could be caught and wrapped.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the issue as they deal with reading data, catching and raising various exceptions, including those related to network issues.

I'm starting by looking at the existing code spans to find any direct connection or propagation of socket.error to determine if it's being caught and converted into an appropriate exception. I'll also check for any architectural logic that indicates how exceptions are processed globally inside the framework that might indirectly impact this, ensuring I have a full contextual view. After analyzing both the initial issue statement and the context provided, I've noted specific parts in the codebase, notably in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', where socket-related errors are handled, such as 'SocketTimeout' errors being converted to 'ReadTimeoutError'. I'll now apply this same scrutiny to the new search results for any similar symptom-based contexts or specific patterns/complements that indicate how a 'socket.error' could potentially escape wrapping in a 'ConnectionError'. Interestingly, the new search results also point to code in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' related to handling various types of exceptions, including 'HTTPException' and 'BaseSSLError'. This relevance suggests that the journey of an error starts in these sections with the possible capability to mimic or directly cover 'socket.error'. It seems both searches converge on this file, indicating critical aspects, particularly around the error control mechanism in the HTTPResponse class's methods, necessitating further attention to excise a precise and encompassing solution for this issue.",
