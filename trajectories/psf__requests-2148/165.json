Instead, it discards the connection and increments the retries, potentially causing inconsistencies in error handling. The `connection.py` file also indicates that `HTTPConnection` handles socket connections and uses `_HTTPConnection` from `httplib`. The `adapters.py` file shows how `HTTPAdapter` handles sending requests and managing exceptions, but similarly does not specifically catch and wrap `socket.error` in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
