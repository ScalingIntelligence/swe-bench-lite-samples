This suggests a need to ensure that socket errors are properly caught and wrapped in a higher-level exception within the requests library. Upon examining the search results, several key areas of interest emerge: 1. In **requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py**, the `WrappedSocket` class handles socket operations, but it does not explicitly wrap `socket.error` into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. 2. In **requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py**, the `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPSConnection` classes manage HTTP and HTTPS connections respectively, but similar to the first observation, do not appear to wrap socket errors. 3. In **requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py**, the `HTTPConnectionPool` class handles the pooling of HTTP connections and the error handling logic for connection issues could be enhanced to include wrapping socket errors. 4. Finally, in **requests/packages/urllib3/response.py**, the `HTTPResponse` class's stream and read methods do not wrap socket errors if they occur during the reading process. Overall, the identified spans indicate where socket errors are encountered but not necessarily wrapped into requests-specific exceptions, which aligns with the reported issue. Thus, the search task is not complete as there is a need to identify or implement code that catches socket errors and raises a corresponding requests exception.",

To address this, we need to identify sections of code that involve handling network errors and possibly not wrapping them in appropriate `requests` exceptions. From the provided search results, there are several sections of code that deal with handling various network-related errors (e.g., SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, SocketError) in different parts of the codebase. Notably, the `HTTPResponse.read` method in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' directly handles SocketTimeout and BaseSSLError without wrapping them in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Additionally, the `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' handles SocketTimeout and SocketError. These sections are relevant as they show where raw socket errors are handled without being appropriately wrapped. Further inspection of these sections can help pinpoint where updates might be needed to ensure proper exception wrapping.",

The key areas to focus on are the _new_conn, connect, and _make_request methods in the HTTPConnectionPool class, which deal with establishing connections and making HTTP requests. Additionally, the HTTPSConnection class is also relevant as it handles secure connections.

However, the exact handling of socket.error such as 'Connection reset by peer' is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

The traceback provided in the issue indicates that the error originates from the socket.py file, specifically in the read method of the socket object. This suggests that the error handling might be insufficient in the relevant parts of the codebase where socket operations are performed.\n\nThe current file context and the search results focus on the urllib3 package, which is a dependency of requests and handles low-level network operations. The relevant files and spans in the search results include:\n1. requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py - This file is crucial as it contains classes like HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection which manage socket connections.\n2. requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py - This file manages pools of connections and is where connection errors might be handled.\n3. requests/packages/urllib3/response.py - This file contains the HTTPResponse class which reads data from the socket connection.\n\nBy examining these files, it's possible to identify where socket errors are raised and determine if they are appropriately caught and wrapped in higher-level exceptions like requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. This involves looking at methods such as _new_conn, connect, _make_request, read, and stream, which are involved in establishing connections, making requests, and reading responses. The goal is to ensure that any socket errors are caught and re-raised as higher-level exceptions to provide a better user experience and ease of error handling in client code.",
