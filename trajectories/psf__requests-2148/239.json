The user expects a requests exception when using the requests library to handle network operations. To address this, we need to identify where the socket.error is being directly raised without being caught and wrapped in a requests-specific exception. The search results include several key files and code spans that handle network connections and could potentially raise or catch socket errors: \n\n1. **requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py**: This file contains HTTP and HTTPS connection classes, including `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPSConnection`. The `connect` method in both classes is responsible for making the actual network connection, which could raise socket errors.\n\n2. **requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py**: This file contains connection pool handling for HTTP and HTTPS, including the `_make_request` and `urlopen` methods. These methods handle the actual sending of HTTP requests and could catch or raise socket errors.\n\n3. **requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py**: This file handles multiple connection pools for different hosts and includes the `urlopen` method, which is likely to interact with network sockets.\n\n4. **requests/adapters.py**: Contains the `HTTPAdapter` class with a `send` method responsible for sending the request, which could also interact with network sockets and catch errors.\n\n5. **requests/sessions.py**: The `Session` class with its `send` method will use the adapters to send requests and could potentially catch errors from lower levels.\n\nBy focusing on these sections, we can identify where socket errors might be raised and how they are being handled, determining whether they are appropriately wrapped in a requests-specific exception. This will help determine the relevant code spans that need modification to address the issue.",
