The provided stack trace and relevant files indicate that the error occurs during the process of reading data from a socket, and it propagates as a raw socket error rather than being caught and re-raised as a requests exception. The search should focus on the areas where the socket errors might be caught and converted or wrapped into RequestException subclasses such as ConnectionError. This includes critical files like 'requests/models.py', 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', and 'requests/adapters.py', among others.",

This issue suggests a need to ensure that all network-related exceptions from low-level libraries (such as `socket` or `httplib`) are properly caught and re-raised as `requests` exceptions. \n\nFrom the search results, the `requests/exceptions.py` file provides various exception classes that could be used to wrap the low-level exceptions, including `ConnectionError`. However, the actual handling of network exceptions is distributed across multiple files. In `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, there's evidence of the use of `socket` and `HTTPException`, which are critical for understanding how connections are managed and where exceptions might originate. In `requests/adapters.py`, the `HTTPAdapter` class is used to send requests, and exceptions from `socket` errors are caught here and re-raised as `ConnectionError`. This suggests a potential location for improving exception handling.\n\nIt appears that current handling in `HTTPAdapter.send` method does not uniformly wrap all `socket.error` exceptions into `ConnectionError`. Specifically, the provided code identifies places where `socket.error` is caught but not wrapped in `ConnectionError`, indicating the issue described by the user. There are also related classes such as `Timeout`, `SSLError`, and `ProxyError` used elsewhere in the module, pointing to a broader pattern of exception handling in network operations within the `requests` library.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's clear that the reported issue is relevant to several code spans. It would be beneficial to refactor the exception handling in the `HTTPAdapter.send` method to ensure all network exceptions are consistently wrapped in higher-level `requests` exceptions.",
