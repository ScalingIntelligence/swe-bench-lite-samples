This discrepancy may arise from the interaction between the socket library and the requests library, particularly in how exceptions are caught or propagated. Given the stack trace and the potential locations of the error, the search should focus on the request library's modules and specifically look for where socket errors might be handled or wrapped into requests exceptions. It's also important to check the functions and methods involved in processing network requests and responses (like `recv`, `read`, and `stream` in the `response.py` and `models.py` files).",

This issue likely occurs during network operations, potentially during HTTP requests or stream handling. From the search results, several files are relevant: 'requests/adapters.py', 'requests/models.py', and 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py'. The 'requests/adapters.py' file contains classes and methods handling HTTP connections, including 'HTTPAdapter' with methods like 'send' and 'get_connection' that could be where socket errors are encountered. The 'requests/models.py' file defines the 'Response' class, which includes methods for handling response content, potentially where a socket error could surface during content retrieval. Finally, 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' includes 'HTTPResponse' with methods for reading and streaming responses, the location where socket errors during content transmission are most likely to occur. Focusing on the 'send' method in 'HTTPAdapter', the 'content' property in 'Response', and the 'read' method in 'HTTPResponse' would be most relevant for addressing the reported issue. These sections involve direct interaction with network operations and content handling, making them critical points for implementing error handling to address the uncaught socket errors.",

This suggests that the relevant code for addressing the issue of not handling raw socket errors is present. Additionally, `models.py` and `response.py` do not appear to directly address socket error handling but are related to data processing and response handling, which might interact with the implemented error handling in `adapters.py`.
