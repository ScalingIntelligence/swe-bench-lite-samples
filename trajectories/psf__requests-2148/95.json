The search results include several files related to the requests package and its underlying libraries (urllib3, pyopenssl). The most relevant sections are those where socket errors are handled or where the ConnectionError exception is defined. \n\n1. 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' contains the HTTPConnection class, which handles socket timeouts and connection creation, but does not handle socket errors explicitly. \n\n2. 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' is more relevant as it includes the HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen method, which handles various exceptions including SocketError (span id 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen'). However, the handling here does not involve wrapping the socket error in a requests exception. \n\n3. 'requests/exceptions.py' defines the ConnectionError class, which is what the issue suggests should be used to wrap socket errors. \n\n4. 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py' do not directly address the socket error wrapping issue but are part of the broader handling of network-related exceptions and retries. \n\nBased on the search results, the codebase does handle some socket errors within the context of the connection pool but does not consistently wrap them in a requests exception as the issue suggests. This indicates a potential gap in error handling that could be addressed by modifying the exception handling logic in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' to wrap certain socket errors with requests.exceptions.ConnectionError.",
