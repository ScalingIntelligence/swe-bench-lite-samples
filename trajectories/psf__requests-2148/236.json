This could potentially lead to abrupt program halts, whereas a wrapped exception would provide more control and better error handling. The focus should be on identifying where socket errors are handled in the requests library, and ensuring they are either caught or re-raised as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Given the traceback provided, it indicates the error occurs within the HTTP handling part of the requests library, specifically around the `recv` method in the socket handling. Therefore, search parameters should focus on these areas, including the `requests/models.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` files, as well as looking for the handling of 'socket.error'. Additionally, it would be beneficial to look into the `requests/adapters.py` to ensure proper exception handling is implemented during HTTP requests.",

This omission is significant because according to the issue, a 'Connection reset by peer' error directly escapes exception handling, which is not ideal for maintainability and error management within the requests library. The traceback also suggests that the error occurs at the point of HTTP data reception, specifically within a call to the 'recv' method in socket handling, an area where 'socket.error' exceptions might emerge. Consequently, current exception handling in the provided file context is incomplete with regard to 'socket.error' exceptions, and additional handling or wrapping of 'socket.error' in 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError' would likely be required to address the issue satisfactorily.",

This oversight means that any `socket.error` that arises, such as 'Connection reset by peer', will propagate up without being caught and wrapped in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

This issue is relevant in three primary locations within the `requests` library: 1. The `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` file, specifically the `HTTPResponse.read` method, which handles reading the response and could potentially catch socket errors. 2. The `requests/models.py` file, particularly the `Response.iter_content` method, which is responsible for streaming content and might also encounter socket errors. 3. The `requests/adapters.py` file, specifically in the `HTTPAdapter.send` method, which sends the request and handles low-level network operations, making it a likely place for socket errors to occur. The analysis of each code span in these locations reveals that the current exception handling does not specifically catch `socket.error` and re-raise it as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This is evidenced in the `HTTPAdapter.send` method, where `socket.error` is caught and raises a `ConnectionError`, but there's no mention of wrapping a specific `socket.error` like 'Errno 104' into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This indicates that the search results provide the necessary context to address the reported issue by enhancing the exception handling in these key methods.",
