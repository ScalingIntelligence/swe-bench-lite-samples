To address this, we need to investigate where socket errors are being handled or propagated in the requests library.

We should focus our search on the connection handling and error wrapping logic in these modules.",

This is critical for maintaining robust exception handling in network-related operations using the `requests` library. The search results offer insights into the `requests` library's internal handling of connection errors and socket operations. The code spans identified are crucial for understanding where and how socket errors are managed. The `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` function in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` is particularly relevant as it directly involves managing HTTP connections, handling retries, and processing responses, including the handling of exceptions like `SocketError`. This function is central to linking low-level socket operations with higher-level `requests` exceptions. Additionally, the `WrappedSocket.recv` function in `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py` is important for understanding how the library manages socket operations involving OpenSSL. The `HTTPResponse.read` function in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` also provides context on reading responses, where handling socket timeouts and other errors are crucial. Together, these spans provide a comprehensive view of the areas where enhancements to exception handling could be made to better wrap raw `socket.error` exceptions in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, thereby addressing the reported issue.",

The provided file context includes relevant parts of the requests and urllib3 libraries dealing with socket errors and their handling. Notably, in the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', there is a catch-all handling of SocketError, HTTPException, and TimeoutError. This suggests that the code already has some mechanisms in place to catch and handle socket errors at a higher level within the requests library. However, it does not explicitly mention wrapping these errors in a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. For completeness, one might want to ensure that such specific socket errors are indeed wrapped in appropriate requests exceptions consistently across the codebase, which might involve modifying existing error handling logic or enhancing it.

The traceback provided indicates that the error originates from the socket.py file when trying to read data from a socket, specifically in the line 'data = self._sock.recv(left)'. The user expects that such socket errors should be caught and re-raised as a higher-level exception like ConnectionError from the requests library.\n\nThe search results include several key files from the urllib3 package that are likely involved in handling network connections and errors. The connectionpool.py file contains the HTTPConnectionPool class with methods like urlopen that handle the actual request operation. The method _make_request in this class is crucial as it makes the actual HTTP request and is likely to be where the error handling should occur.\n\nThe response.py file also contains relevant code in the HTTPResponse class, specifically in the read method, which is where the socket.error might be encountered when trying to read the response data.\n\nAdditionally, the adapters.py file from the requests package includes the HTTPAdapter class, which is responsible for adapting lower-level HTTP library functionality (like urllib3) to the higher-level requests interface. The send method in this class is particularly relevant as it handles the sending of HTTP requests and could be modified to better handle lower-level socket errors.\n\nGiven these findings, the recommended steps would involve identifying the specific method calls or code spans where socket.error exceptions are most likely to be thrown (e.g., during the _make_request call in connectionpool.py) and then modifying those sections to catch socket.error (or specific subtypes) and re-raise them as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. This would involve updating both the urllib3 and requests packages, focusing specifically on areas where network operations occur.",
