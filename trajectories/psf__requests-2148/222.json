From the search results, the following key findings are relevant: 1. The 'ConnectionError' class in 'requests/exceptions.py' which can be used to wrap socket errors. 2. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' file contains connection handling logic, including 'VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect' method where socket operations occur, which could handle or propagate socket errors. 3. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file also contains definitions for exceptions related to HTTP and connection issues, including 'ProtocolError' which is aliased as 'ConnectionError'. These findings suggest potential places to implement or modify exception handling to catch raw socket errors and raise a ConnectionError from the requests library.
