To address this, I need to identify the parts of the codebase where socket errors are handled and ensure they are properly wrapped in a ConnectionError exception. From the search results, I can see that the 'ConnectionError' class exists within the 'requests/exceptions.py' file. Additionally, relevant code spans in other files, such as 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and 'requests/adapters.py', indicate where connections are established and managed. These sections are crucial as they are likely points where socket errors could occur and should be caught and wrapped appropriately. The 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen' method in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method in 'requests/adapters.py' are particularly relevant as they involve the handling of network connections and could be the location where the socket error should be caught and re-raised as a ConnectionError. Further review of these sections would help in identifying the exactspots where improvements are needed to ensure proper exception handling.",

The provided file context includes relevant code from the requests library, particularly in the `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` and `requests/adapters.py` files. In `connectionpool.py`, we see exceptions like `SocketError` and `HTTPException` being handled and potentially raising `ProtocolError` or `ProxyError`. Similarly, in `adapters.py`, there's a direct handling of `socket.error` which is raised as a `ConnectionError`. These sections indicate areas where the socket errors are managed, albeit not explicitly wrapped in a `ConnectionError` as initially reported. Given this context, it appears that the relevant parts of the codebase dealing with socket errors are identified, but the exact wrapping as requested in the issue might need further refinement within the provided files.",
