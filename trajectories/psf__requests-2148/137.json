The error occurs specifically in the context of HTTP response handling, where a socket reset is being raised as a raw socket error instead of being converted into a more appropriate requests exception. Given the stack trace and the existing knowledge of the requests library structure, we should focus our search on the modules handling HTTP connections, response handling, and exception management within the requests library. Specifically, the HTTPResponse class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' and the HTTPConnectionPool class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' are good starting points, as they directly deal with reading HTTP responses and managing HTTP connections, respectively. Additionally, the send method in 'requests/adapters.py' should be checked, as it is responsible for sending requests and could also be the place where socket errors need to be wrapped into requests exceptions.",

This is a critical point for our analysis. We need to identify where the socket error is being handled (or not handled) within the requests library, particularly in the parts of the code responsible for network communication and error handling.\n\nIn the search results, several key files are found: 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', and 'requests/adapters.py'. These files are crucial as they handle lower-level network operations and could be where the socket error occurs and should ideally be caught and wrapped.\n\nWithin 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', 'HTTPResponse' class handles reading responses and could potentially generate socket errors. The 'from_httplib' method in this class processes the response from the HTTP library, which is a likely spot for encountering a socket error during reading.\n\nIn 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', the 'HTTPConnectionPool' class is significant. Methods like '_make_request' and 'urlopen' are directly involved in making network requests and handling responses. These could be where a socket error occurs if the connection is reset or times out.\n\nLastly, in 'requests/adapters.py', the 'HTTPAdapter' class manages connection pooling and sending requests. Methods like 'send' handle sending the request, connecting to the server, and could potentially catch any socket errors occurring during these operations. However, the code lacks explicit handling and wrapping of socket errors at least in the 'send' method, which points to a possible area of improvement.\n\nGiven the reported issue, it is crucial to focus on these classes and methods where network operations occur to ensure socket errors are properly handled and wrapped in higher-level exceptions like 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'.",

These files handle HTTP response processing, connection pooling, and adapter-based request sending, respectively. The issue of interest involves the handling of a 'socket.error' during HTTP response reading, which ideally should be wrapped in a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. The 'HTTPResponse' class in 'response.py' has methods that read and decode HTTP responses, and it currently catches several exceptions including 'SocketTimeout', 'BaseSSLError', and 'HTTPException', but it does not explicitly catch 'socket.error'. The 'ConnectionPool' classes in 'connectionpool.py' manage the pooling of HTTP and HTTPS connections, but they do not directly handle the reading of data from the socket. The 'HTTPAdapter' class in 'adapters.py' is responsible for sending HTTP requests, but it does not contain specific logic for handling 'socket.error' exceptions during response reading. Given the provided context, there is identified code that could potentially be modified to address the issue by adding a handler for 'socket.error' in the 'HTTPResponse.read' method. However, the specific modification to wrap 'socket.error' into a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError' is not present in the provided code snippets.",

The provided search results and file context focus on the relevant parts of the urllib3 and requests libraries where socket errors might be encountered. The 'HTTPResponse.read' span in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' is particularly relevant as it handles reading from the socket and could potentially catch or propagate socket errors. Additionally, the 'HTTPAdapter.send' span in 'requests/adapters.py' is crucial as it orchestrates the sending of requests and might need to handle or propagate such errors to a higher level. Both these spans contain try-except blocks that handle various exceptions, including socket-related ones.

From the search results, we can identify relevant spans in `requests/adapters.py` where the `HTTPAdapter.send` method handles exceptions, including `socket.error`. The current handling is to raise a `ConnectionError` with the socket error. To address the issue, we should consider catching specific `socket.error` exceptions and re-raising them as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Additionally, the `HTTPResponse.read` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` also catches and handles `SocketTimeout` and `BaseSSLError`, suggesting a pattern where exceptions are wrapped into more specific custom exceptions. This observation supports the need to wrap `socket.error` in a custom `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` for consistency and clarity in exception handling.",
