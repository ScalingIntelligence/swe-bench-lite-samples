To address this, it's necessary to identify where the socket errors are not being caught and wrapped in a requests exception.

Searching for the relevant parts of the codebase, especially in files dealing with HTTP responses and connection handling, is crucial.",

The traces in the issue point to the 'requests/packages/urllib3' module, specifically its 'connection.py', 'connectionpool.py', and 'response.py' files, where the handling of socket errors seems to be implicated. In these files, there are several key methods like 'HTTPConnection._new_conn', 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request', 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen', and 'HTTPResponse.from_httplib' which are directly involved in making and handling network requests. These methods do not appear to catch specific 'socket.error' exceptions, which aligns with the user's report. The 'retry.py' file also contains a 'Retry' class that might handle some errors but does not directly address 'socket.error'. I will focus on identifying the code spans in these files to suggest improvements or additions to catch and wrap 'socket.error' into 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'.",

These modules contain key functions like '_new_conn', '_make_request', and 'urlopen' where socket errors can potentially occur and should be intercepted. Each of these modules includes spans where socket errors are either directly handled or where an opportunity exists to enhance error handling by wrapping socket errors with requests-specific exceptions, aligning with the issue's requirements.
