The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during the processing of an HTTP response, specifically when reading data from the socket. Given the stack trace and the code context provided, there are several areas to focus on: the `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPConnectionPool` classes in urllib3, the `Response` class in requests, and the `WrappedSocket` class in pyopenssl. These areas are crucial for handling network errors and streaming data, which are directly related to the observed issue. By specifying these classes and the error message, we can narrow down the search for the exact location where the exception handling needs improvement.",
