This suggests that there might be a need to catch the socket.error and raise a ConnectionError instead. To address this, I will focus on the code spans that deal with connection handling and error management. Specifically, I will look for areas where socket-related errors might occur and are not being handled by the requests library.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the 'HTTPConnection' and 'HTTPSConnection' classes from the 'connection.py' module. These classes are responsible for establishing and managing HTTP and HTTPS connections, so they are likely places where the socket.error could occur.\n\nNext, I will examine the code spans in 'HTTPConnectionPool' and 'HTTPSConnectionPool' classes from the 'connectionpool.py' module. These classes manage the pooling of connections, and any socket errors during connection establishment or usage would be critical to catch.\n\nLastly, I will check for any error handling mechanisms in the 'HTTPAdapter' class from the 'adapters.py' module as it handles the low-level communication to the HTTP servers.\n\nBy examining these code spans, I hope to identify where the socket.error is being raised without proper handling and determine if they need to be wrapped in a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError.",

The provided file context and search results show relevant code spans within the requests and urllib3 packages, particularly in the HTTPConnection, HTTPConnectionPool, and HTTPAdapter classes. These spans include methods for handling connections, timeouts, retries, and exceptions. By analyzing these spans, I can identify the parts of the codebase that directly deal with socket errors and connection management. This includes the _new_conn method in HTTPConnection, the _make_request method in HTTPConnectionPool, and the send method in HTTPAdapter, which handle the establishment of new connections, the actual HTTP request, and the delegation of the request to the connection pool, respectively. These methods are critical for understanding how socket errors are currently managed and where improvements to catch and wrap these errors in a more appropriate requests exception might be implemented. The search results confirm the presence of these key methods, providing the necessary context to address the reported issue effectively.",
