            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a raw socket.error being raised instead of a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError when a socket reset occurs. This issue is related to error handling in the requests library during network operations. The search results provide several code spans that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py**:\n   - The `HTTPConnectionPool` class and its methods such as `_new_conn`, `_get_conn`, `_make_request`, and `urlopen` are crucial as they involve the actual connection management and request making. These methods handle socket connections and could potentially catch and wrap socket errors.\n   - Specifically, the `_make_request` method interacts directly with the connection's socket and sets timeouts, which is where a socket.error could potentially be raised.\n   - The `urlopen` method in this class is the one that initiates the request and could be modified to catch and handle socket errors.\n\n2. **requests/adapters.py**:\n   - The `HTTPAdapter` class and its `send` method are responsible for sending the request and handling the connection to the server. This is another layer where socket errors could be caught and processed.\n\n3. **requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py**:\n   - The `PoolManager` class and its `urlopen` method oversee connection pools and manage requests. This class leverages `HTTPConnectionPool`, making it another possible point to intercept and handle socket errors.\n\n4. **requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/ntlmpool.py**:\n   - The `NTLMConnectionPool` class and its `urlopen` method in this module handle NTLM connections. While the issue reported is not specific to NTLM connections, this highlights the extensibility and different connection types managed by urllib3, emphasizing the need to consider various connection scenarios.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are those within the `HTTPConnectionPool` class's `_make_request` and `urlopen` methods, the `HTTPAdapter` class's `send` method, and the `PoolManager` class's `urlopen` method. These areas involve direct socket interactions and request handling, making them the appropriate places to implement error handling for `socket.error` exceptions.",
