Given the stack trace, the critical sections are likely within the requests library, particularly around the areas dealing with network connections and response handling.

The search results provided include the definition of ConnectionError within the requests library, which aligns with the expectation that such errors should be wrapped in a requests exception. Additionally, the search results from `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` show code that handles various exceptions, including SocketTimeout and HTTPException, which suggests that there is already exception handling in place. However, the specific socket.error observed in the issue traceback is not explicitly caught and converted to a requests exception in the provided search results. Therefore, the identified code spans do not fully resolve the issue of missing wrapping of socket.error into requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Further investigation or modification of the exception handling logic might be needed to address the reported issue.",

It's imperative to ensure that any raised socket errors within these or related areas are appropriately wrapped in a requests exception, specifically `ConnectionError`.

The code provided in the initial report suggests that the error is occurring in the `recv` method of a socket object, which is part of the low-level networking operations. The task is to find and identify code spans that deal with catching or wrapping socket errors into requests exceptions.\n\nIn the file_context section:\n- `requests/exceptions.py` defines various exception classes, including `ConnectionError` which is a subclass of `RequestException`.\n- `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` contains handling for socket timeouts and SSL errors which are converted into exceptions like `ReadTimeoutError` and `ProtocolError`.\n\nIn the search_results section:\n- `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py` shows how SSL sockets are wrapped and exceptions like `OpenSSL.SSL.SysCallError` during receive operations are handled.\n- `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` demonstrates how HTTP connections are established and demonstrates error handling through `HTTPException` on connection problems.\n- `requests/exceptions.py` reappears to confirm the definition and structure of exception handling within the requests library.\n\nGiven these findings, it is clear that the relevant files for this issue are those which deal with network communication and exception handling within the requests library. The identified spans from `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` are most directly related, as they handle the reading of data and the conversion of low-level network errors into the exceptions defined in `requests/exceptions.py`.",

To address this, we need to identify the places in the codebase where socket errors are being handled and ensure they are properly wrapped in ConnectionError exceptions. Upon reviewing the search results, several relevant files and spans have been identified:\n\n1. **requests/exceptions.py**: This file contains the definition of ConnectionError, which is the exception type we want to use for wrapping socket errors.\n\n2. **requests/packages/urllib3/response.py**: This file contains the HTTPResponse class, which handles reading from the response. The 'read' method specifically handles various exceptions, including HTTPException and SSLError, but does not explicitly handle socket.error. Adding a catch for socket.error and raising ConnectionError would be appropriate here.\n\n3. **requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py**: The HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes in this file manage the creation and preparation of connection objects. The '_new_conn' method handles SocketTimeout, but not other socket errors. Adding a catch for socket errors and raising ConnectionError or a more specific subclass (e.g., ConnectTimeoutError) where appropriate would address this issue.\n\n4. **requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py**: This file defines various exceptions used throughout urllib3, including ConnectionError and its subclasses. Understanding these exception types will help in determining the most appropriate exception types to use for different kinds of network errors.\n\n5. **requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py**: This file contains the Retry class, which manages retry logic. Understanding how retries interact with exceptions can provide insight into how to handle and possibly retry on socket errors in a systematic way.",

The issue reported concerns the lack of appropriate error handling for socket errors, specifically the 'Connection reset by peer', within the `requests` library. The provided code snippets include the `requests/exceptions.py` file defining various exceptions, including `ConnectionError`. However, the critical examination of `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` does not explicitly show how `socket.error` exceptions are caught and wrapped into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This suggests that the relevant code necessary to address the issue is not fully present in the provided context.\n\nAdditionally, the `HTTPResponse` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` features methods for reading data that could, in theory, be modified to include proper error handling for socket errors. Yet, the specific step to catch `socket.error` and raise a `ConnectionError` is not shown in the provided context. This indicates that while the context points to the area where modifications might occur, it does not show the specific implementation of such modifications.",

These methods should be closely examined to ensure that they include proper error handling for `socket.error` exceptions and that these exceptions are wrapped into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Additionally, it would be beneficial to check if there are other parts of the `requests` library or its dependencies where similar error handling might be needed."
