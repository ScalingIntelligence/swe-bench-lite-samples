It seems that these exceptions are not being caught and wrapped in a more specific requests exception like ConnectionError. To address this, we need to locate where the socket.error exceptions are being raised and ensure that they are properly wrapped in a requests-specific exception. Given the stack trace and the relevant files provided, it would be beneficial to search in the files and methods where these exceptions might be originating - primarily focusing on the connection handling and response reading parts of the requests library. We need to check if there are specific places where the socket.error should be caught and re-raised as a ConnectionError or a similar requests-specific exception. We should also look for any global exception handling or middleware that might be affecting how these exceptions are propagated.",
