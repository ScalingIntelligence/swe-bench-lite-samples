This suggests that the error handling within the requests library might not be wrapping all possible socket errors as ConnectionError. To address this, we need to identify locations where socket errors are being directly handled or propagated within the requests library. We should specifically look for instances where socket errors are not wrapped in a requests exception. Given the stack trace, the error occurs in the 'read' method of the 'httplib' module, which is intercepted by the 'gevent' library before encountering the requests library. Therefore, the focus should primarily be on the requests library code where socket errors are handled or propagated.",

To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle or propagate exceptions during HTTP requests. From the search results, I've identified the following relevant code spans:\n\n1. In `requests/exceptions.py`, the `ConnectionError` class is defined as a subclass of `RequestException`, which is a good starting point as it indicates where a specific exception for connection errors is defined.\n\n2. In `requests/models.py`, the `Response.iter_content` method handles chunked content retrieval, and the `Response.content` property deals with the content of the response. These could be areas where a socket error might occur and should ideally be wrapped in a ConnectionError.\n\n3. In `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, the `HTTPResponse.read` method is responsible for reading response data, and it handles various exceptions, including `SocketTimeout` and `HTTPException`. This is another critical area as it directly interacts with lower-level I/O operations.\n\nBased on these findings, the relevant code spans are:\n- `requests/exceptions.py`: ConnectionError class definition\n- `requests/models.py`: Response.iter_content and Response.content\n- `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`: HTTPResponse.read\n\nThese sections should be carefully reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that socket.error exceptions are caught and wrapped in a more appropriate requests exception like ConnectionError.",

This suggests that the codebase is structured to handle many HTTP-related exceptions within the 'requests' library itself.

Given this context, it seems that the primary area of concern is how gevent handles socket errors in its 'read' methods, as these errors might not be caught and propagated correctly before reaching the requests library's exception wrapping logic.

The provided context and search results help identify relevant sections in the codebase that handle exceptions and socket operations. Here's a breakdown of the relevance of each file and section:\n\n1. **requests/exceptions.py**: Defines various exceptions including ConnectionError. Relevant spans include 'RequestException', 'ConnectionError', and their initializations.\n2. **requests/models.py**: Handles HTTP response content processing. Relevant spans include 'Response' and 'Response.content' where the content is read and processed.\n3. **requests/packages/urllib3/response.py**: Plays a critical role in reading HTTP responses. Notably, the 'HTTPResponse.read' span handles reading chunks of data and could potentially catch socket errors.\n4. **requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py**: Manages HTTP connections. The 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request' span specifically handles making HTTP requests and includes handling for socket timeouts and errors.\n5. **requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py**: Deals with OpenSSL socket handling for HTTPS. The 'WrappedSocket.recv' span is relevant as it handles receiving data, possibly catching SSL errors under certain conditions.\n6. **requests/packages/urllib3/util/timeout.py**: Contains the Timeout class which manages connection timeouts. The 'Timeout.read_timeout' property is crucial for managing read timeouts during data reception.\n7. **requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py**: Defines various custom exceptions. Though 'ProtocolError', 'HostChangedError', 'EmptyPoolError', and others are defined, they do not directly address wrapping a socket.error.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant sections are those in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' (specifically 'HTTPResponse.read'), 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' (especially 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request'), and 'requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py' ('WrappedSocket.recv'). These sections directly involve reading from and handling socket operations, making them prime candidates for implementing or improving exception handling to catch and wrap raw socket errors in a more specific request exception like ConnectionError.",

The 'models.py' file where the 'Response' class is defined, also includes handling for specific errors like 'ChunkedEncodingError' and 'ContentDecodingError' during content iteration and reading. Furthermore, the 'response.py' file within the 'urllib3' package contains the 'HTTPResponse' class that reads and decodes response content, where several exceptions are handled to manage reading timeouts and other communication issues.
