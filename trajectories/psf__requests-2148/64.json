To address this, we need to identify the areas in the codebase where socket errors might be occurring during network operations, specifically within the requests library or its underlying components. The provided stack trace and excerpts from relevant files suggest that the error occurs during the handling of HTTP responses and potentially during socket operations within connection management. We should focus our search on the `connectionpool.py`, `connection.py`, `models.py`, and `response.py` files within the `requests` package, as these are directly involved in managing network connections and handling responses. Additionally, examining the `HTTPAdapter` and `Retry` classes in the `adapters.py` and `retry.py` files respectively could provide insights into how connection errors are managed and retried.",

By examining the provided search results, I identified relevant code spans in the 'requests/adapters.py' file. Key spans include those related to the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method where the original issue might be occurring. The 'HTTPAdapter.send' method contains a try-except block specifically designed to catch 'socket.error' and re-raise it as 'ConnectionError'. This aligns with the reported issue of needing to catch low-level socket errors and wrap them in higher-level requests exceptions. Therefore, the relevant spans focus on handling network-related exceptions and transforming them into exceptions that are specific to the requests library. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans from 'requests/adapters.py' are 'HTTPAdapter.send' and possibly others that handle similar exceptions, as well as related methods like 'HTTPAdapter.get_connection' which initializes connections that might raise these errors. This covers the essential parts of the codebase where the issue might be addressed or further handled.",
