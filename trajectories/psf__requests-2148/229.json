To address this, it's necessary to identify where in the code the `socket.error` is handled and determine if it can be appropriately wrapped by `requests.exceptions`. The search results reveal several classes in the `requests` and `requests/packages/urllib3` modules that are relevant: \n\n1. In `requests/exceptions.py`, the `ConnectionError` class is defined as a subclass of `RequestException`, which is suitable for wrapping lower-level network errors. This class is likely the target for wrapping any `socket.error` instances.\n\n2. In `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, there are several spans involving direct interaction with the `socket` module and potential for raising `socket.error`. Specifically, in `VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect`, there is a direct call to `ssl_wrap_socket`, which could potentially raise a `socket.error`.\n\n3. Similarly, in `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`, the `ConnectionError` class is defined, albeit under a different module hierarchy, but with similar intent. This class could also be used for wrapping `socket.error`.\n\nThese identified spans suggest potential areas in the codebase where a `socket.error` could be caught and re-raised as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` or a related custom exception to provide better context and encapsulation of the error in the requests library context.",

The search results provide valuable insights into where socket errors can occur within the requests library. Here's a breakdown: 1. In 'requests/adapters.py', the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method attempts to open a connection. If a socket.error occurs, it raises a ConnectionError, which aligns with the desired behavior. 2. The 'HTTPConnection._new_conn' method in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' handles connection creation and can raise a ConnectTimeoutError, but doesn't specifically address raw socket.error instances. 3. 'VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect' also in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' contains logic for establishing an HTTPS connection and handling SSL certificates. If a socket error occurs here, it currently wouldn't be caught and wrapped as a ConnectionError. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans should cover files 'requests/adapters.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py', since they are directly involved in connection handling and can benefit from improved socket error handling.",
