To address this, we need to investigate where the socket error is being raised and ensure it is appropriately caught and wrapped in a requests exception. Given the stack trace, the relevant files seem to be within the 'requests' package, particularly in modules like 'models.py', 'adapters.py', and the 'urllib3' sub-package. Focus should be on the 'HTTPResponse', 'HTTPConnectionPool', and 'HTTPAdapter' classes as they handle network operations and could potentially raise or catch these exceptions. Additionally, inspecting the exception handling mechanisms in these files will be crucial to ensure proper wrapping of socket errors into requests exceptions.",

This indicates a need to review the handling of socket errors in the requests library and its dependencies, particularly urllib3, which is used by requests for handling HTTP connections. The search results show several spans of code in urllib3's connectionpool.py and response.py, as well as in requests' adapters.py. These files contain critical logic for managing connections, handling timeouts, and processing HTTP responses, making them relevant to the issue. The spans 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request' in connectionpool.py and 'HTTPResponse' in response.py are of particular interest as they involve making HTTP requests and handling responses, where socket errors might occur. Additionally, the 'HTTPAdapter' class in adapters.py, which is responsible for managing the HTTP transport, is relevant for understanding how requests are sent and how errors might be propagated. These spans provide the context needed to evaluate how socket errors are managed within the requests ecosystem and whether they are properly wrapped in higher-level exceptions.",

The 'HTTPConnectionPool' class in 'connectionpool.py' handles connection management and makes HTTP requests, which could potentially raise socket errors. The '_make_request' method in this class handles different types of exceptions, including 'SocketTimeout', 'BaseSSLError', and 'SocketError'. However, the specific handling of 'socket.error' (e.g., 'Connection reset by peer') is not explicitly wrapped in a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. Similarly, in 'response.py', the 'HTTPResponse' class deals with reading from the socket, where 'SocketTimeout' exceptions are handled and turned into 'ReadTimeoutError'. There is no explicit handling of other 'socket.error' exceptions transforming them into 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. The 'HTTPAdapter' class in 'adapters.py' is responsible for mounting adapters to specific URL schemes but does not directly handle socket errors. Based on this analysis, it seems that the current relevant code provided does identify areas where 'socket.error' can be raised, but does not explicitly handle or wrap all such errors into 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. There are places where this could be implemented, but it is not directly done within the provided context.",

These files are critical for handling HTTP connections and responses in the requests library, which suggests that the relevant code spans are likely to be found here. The specific sections of interest include the `_make_request` method in the `HTTPConnectionPool` class from `connectionpool.py`, which handles making HTTP requests and might catch or propagate socket errors, and the `read` method in the `HTTPResponse` class from `response.py`, which reads the response from the HTTP request and can encounter socket timeouts or errors. Additionally, near line 694 in `requests/models.py`, where the content of the response is processed, shows interaction with the HTTPResponse object and thus could be relevant. The identified relevant code spans across files (`connectionpool.py`, `response.py`, and potentially `models.py`) together provide a more complete context of how requests are made and responses are handled in the codebase, which is essential for addressing the reported issue.",
