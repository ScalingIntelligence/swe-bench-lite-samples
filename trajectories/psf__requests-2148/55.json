The provided search results show several key areas of the codebase where socket errors might arise, particularly during socket operations like receiving data, connecting to sockets, and managing pools of connections. The HTTPConnectionPool class and its related methods such as '_new_conn', '_get_conn', and '_make_request' are central to handling these errors, as they involve direct interaction with sockets and HTTP connections. Additionally, the 'HTTPConnection' and 'HTTPSConnection' classes also manage the creation of new connections and their preparation, which are critical steps where socket errors can occur. Therefore, focusing on these sections of the code will be necessary to implement proper error handling around socket operations for enhanced robustness and clarity in error reporting.",
