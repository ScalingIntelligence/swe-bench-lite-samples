This discrepancy could be due to unhandled exceptions or missing error wrapping in the requests library. Given the stack trace and the nature of the error, the focus should be on the `requests` module, specifically in code sections related to connection handling, exception management, and potentially custom socket handling like in `urllib3` or `pyopenssl`. The search should primarily target files within these modules to ensure proper exception wrapping.",

The search results indicate multiple files and spans of code related to HTTP and HTTPS connections, handling timeouts, and managing connection pools. Specifically, the HTTPConnectionPool and HTTPConnection classes in urllib3 deal with the underlying socket communication, which matches the issue context. These classes handle the creation of new connections, validation of existing connections, and making HTTP requests, all of which could potentially raise a socket.error. The identified spans include the methods for making requests, handling timeouts, and managing connections, where an appropriate place to add the exception handling for socket errors could occur. Additionally, the HTTPAdapter class in requests' adapters.py also plays a role in sending requests and could be a potential location to implement exception handling for the socket errors as it interacts directly with the connection pool. Overall, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and provide a clear direction for implementing the necessary exception handling.",
