Given the code spans provided, several files and methods are relevant to this issue. The `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` processes various exceptions, including `SocketError`, which is potentially where the error is being raised without proper handling. The `HTTPAdapter.send` method in `requests/adapters.py` is also critical as it sends requests and handles various types of errors, including socket errors, by raising a `ConnectionError`. The `PoolManager.urlopen` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py` is responsible for managing the URL connections and also has error handling code. These methods need detailed inspection to ensure proper wrapping of socket errors into a requests exception. Additionally, the `WrappedSocket.recv` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py` directly deals with socket receiving data, which can also raise socket errors and might need error handling adjustments.",
