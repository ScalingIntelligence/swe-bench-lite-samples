This suggests that there might be a gap in the error handling for socket errors within the requests library. Given the stack trace, it is clear that the error originates from socket operations deep within requests internals. To address this, we should focus on the connection and error handling parts of the codebase, particularly where socket errors might be occurring or propagating without being properly wrapped.",
