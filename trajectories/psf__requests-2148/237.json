To address this, a search should focus on the request handling and exception management code within the requests library. Specific files and functions related to connection handling, response reading, and exception wrapping should be targeted.

In `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the methods `_new_conn`, `_get_conn`, `_validate_conn`, `_get_timeout`, and `_make_request` could be relevant as they deal with connection management and error handling. Similarly, methods in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` like `_new_conn`, `_prepare_conn`, and `connect` are also likely places socket errors could occur. Additionally, the `HTTPResponse.read` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` could be checked as it deals with reading the response which could also throw socket errors. Further investigation is needed in these code spans to ensure all relevant areas are covered.",

This can lead to the raw socket error being exposed to the user, which is not the expected behavior when using the requests library.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, several key areas are relevant to address this issue:\n\n1. **HTTPConnectionPool._make_request**: This method makes an HTTP request and handles various exceptions, including SocketTimeout and BaseSSLError. However, it does not explicitly catch socket.error, which is the issue at hand.\n\n2. **HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen**: This method is responsible for URL opening and could potentially be a good place to add the necessary exception handling to catch socket.error and re-raise it as a requests exception.\n\n3. **HTTPAdapter.send**: This method is part of the HTTPAdapter class, which is responsible for sending requests. It involves getting connections and handling cert verification, making it a candidate for enhancing exception handling.\n\nGiven these points, the identified code spans include the methods where the socket.error should be caught and wrapped in a requests exception.
