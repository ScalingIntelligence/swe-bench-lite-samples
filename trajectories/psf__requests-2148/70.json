Given the provided stack trace and the relevant files, focusing on the areas where HTTP requests are made, responded to, or handled by the 'requests' library seems crucial. Specifically, investigating the module where the error occurs, the 'requests/models.py' file, and its related components like 'requests/adapters.py', 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' would be a good starting point. Also, checking 'socket.py' and 'gevent/socket.py' for how the underlying socket operations handle errors could provide deeper insights.",

The issue specifies that a raw `socket.error` is being raised instead of being wrapped in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This suggests that relevant code spans would be those dealing with socket operations and exception handling within the `requests` library. The search results include several files from the `requests` library, specifically focusing on the `urllib3` package, which `requests` uses internally for HTTP operations. The code spans from these files cover various aspects such as socket handling, HTTP response reading, connection pooling, and the HTTP adapter in `requests`. Particularly relevant are the code spans in `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, which deal with socket-level operations and exception handling. These sections are likely where improvements or checks need to be added to ensure `socket.error` exceptions are caught and appropriately wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Additionally, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method in `requests/adapters.py` and the `Session.send` method in `requests/sessions.py` are also important as they interface with the underlying HTTP operations and could be points where additional exception handling is needed.",
