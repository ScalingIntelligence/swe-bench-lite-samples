To address this, we need to identify where the socket error is being raised and where it should be caught and wrapped. We can focus our search on areas where socket errors might occur during HTTP requests, specifically in the requests library. Given the stack trace, we know that the error occurs during the HTTP response processing, likely in the requests/models.py file. We should also consider other areas in the requests library that might handle socket errors, such as the adapters, connection pooling, and the urllib3 package used by requests. We should specifically look for instances where socket.error is raised and not caught or wrapped in a requests exception.",

Given the structure of exceptions in 'requests/exceptions.py' and the potential to catch and convert lower-level exceptions like socket errors to more specialized exceptions provided by the requests module, this ConnectionError class is likely the one we should be using to address the reported issue. Additionally, the file 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' defines a ConnectionError alias for ProtocolError, but this is more specific to the urllib3 package, and the issue seems to be focused on catching errors within the requests library, so the ConnectionError from 'requests/exceptions.py' would be the most fitting to handle the socket errors that propagate directly to the user.",

This indicates a need to ensure that socket errors are properly caught and converted into an appropriate requests exception. The initial file context provides an overview of various exceptions defined in the 'requests/exceptions.py' file, including 'ConnectionError' which should be utilized for such scenarios. The search results in 'requests/packages/urllib3/util/connection.py' reveal functions 'create_connection' and 'is_connection_dropped' where socket operations are performed. The function 'create_connection' attempts to create a socket and handle errors by raising them, which aligns well with the issue at hand. This suggests that modifications around these areas might be necessary to ensure that socket errors like 'Connection reset by peer' are caught and re-raised as 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. Additionally, there's an 'is_connection_dropped' function that checks if a connection is dropped but doesn't handle the associated error in a way that addresses the issue directly. It's crucial to ensure that any socket errors encountered in these functions are properly wrapped in the appropriate 'ConnectionError' exception from the 'requests' library. This approach aligns with the general expectation that higher-level libraries like 'requests' should abstract lower-level errors, providing a more consistent and user-friendly exception handling mechanism.",
