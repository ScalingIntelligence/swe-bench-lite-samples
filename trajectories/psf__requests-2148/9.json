The traceback provided in the issue points to a socket.error being raised directly when a connection is reset by the peer. The task is to identify code spans in the search results that handle or propagate socket errors, and determine if they appropriately transform these into higher-level exceptions such as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Upon analyzing the code spans provided in the search results, particularly in the `requests/adapters.py` file, we find a relevant section that captures `socket.error` and raises `ConnectionError`. This aligns with the issue reported as it introduces the higher-level exception that encapsulates network-related errors. Additionally, the `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` file shows how different types of errors, including `SocketError`, are handled, although it primarily converts them into urllib3-specific exceptions. The retrieval of related code spans for further review should focus on these areas to ensure comprehensiveness in exception handling.",
