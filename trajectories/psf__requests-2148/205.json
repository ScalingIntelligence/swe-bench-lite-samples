To address this, I should focus the search on the parts of the requests library that handle network communications, particularly where socket errors might be encountered. This includes examining the connection handling, response handling, and possibly the adapters where network requests are sent. Given the stack trace, I should particularly focus on areas where socket.recv is used, as this is where the socket error occurs. Given the existing files and the stack trace, it seems like a good starting point would be to focus on the 'requests/adapters.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' files and search for methods or code blocks involving network communication or socket handling.",

The context shows that 'HTTPConnectionPool' catches several network-related exceptions and retries or raises them, but there's no explicit handling of 'socket.error' that translates it to 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'.

We need to ensure that 'SocketError' is consistently translated into a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. From the provided context, it's seen that 'HTTPAdapter' in 'requests/adapters.py' already converts 'socket.error' to 'ConnectionError', which indicates that this part of the codebase already handles 'SocketError' appropriately. However, it's essential to check if similar handling exists in 'HTTPConnectionPool' in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py'. The context shows that 'HTTPConnectionPool' catches several network-related exceptions and retries or raises them, but there's no explicit handling of 'socket.error' that translates it to 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. This suggests that 'HTTPConnectionPool' might need further adjustments to ensure all 'SocketError' instances are correctly handled and wrapped as 'ConnectionError'.",
