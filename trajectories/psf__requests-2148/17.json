The traceback provided shows that the error originates from a socket reset, which is being raised as a raw socket.error instead of being handled appropriately by the requests library. The analysis of the search results indicates several potential places where the socket error handling might be implemented or tweaked to better align with the expected behavior of the requests library. The relevant files identified include 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py', which defines HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes and their connect methods where socket connections are established. 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' contains the HTTPConnectionPool class with a urlopen method where network requests are made and exceptions might need to be caught. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py' file is also relevant with its PoolManager and ProxyManager classes handling URL connections. Finally, the 'requests/adapters.py' file includes the HTTPAdapter class, which is responsible for sending requests and could include a mechanism to catch and re-raise socket errors as requests exceptions. Based on the issue description and the search results, it appears that the primary area of concern is around the 'urlopen' methods in the connection pool, pool manager, and adapter classes, where handling of socket errors should be added or adjusted.",
