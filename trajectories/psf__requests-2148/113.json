This occurs when a socket reset happens, and it is raised as a raw socket error rather than a more specific requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Given the stack trace and the context, the focus should be on the 'requests' library where such exception handling might be missing. The goal is to find where socket.error is directly exposed without being wrapped into a requests exception, likely in the code handling HTTP requests or connections within the 'requests' library.",

The traceback provided shows that the error originates from a socket.py file, and it would be ideal to catch this error and raise a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError instead. Given the search results, several key areas seem relevant:\n\n1. **requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py**: This file contains the HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes which are responsible for making the actual HTTP and HTTPS connections. The `_new_conn` method in these classes is a likely place to catch and handle socket errors.\n\n2. **requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py**: This file contains the HTTPConnectionPool class which manages the connections. The `_make_request` method is critical as it is where the actual HTTP request is made, and catching socket errors here would be appropriate.\n\n3. **requests/adapters.py**: The HTTPAdapter class in this file is responsible for dispatching the request to the appropriate connection pool. The `send` method in this class is another potential place to catch and handle socket errors.\n\n4. **requests/models.py**: Although not directly related to the connection process, the Response class in this file might need some handling for situations where a raw socket error bubbles up to affect the response.\n\nTo address the issue, we should focus on modifying the `_new_conn`, `_make_request`, and `send` methods to catch socket errors and re-raise them as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. This will ensure that the error handling is consistent and user-friendly. The identified code spans should be examined and modified accordingly.\n",
