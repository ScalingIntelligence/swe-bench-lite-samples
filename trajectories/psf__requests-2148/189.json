This suggests that the codebase should catch socket.error exceptions and wrap them in requests-specific exceptions. The search results included several files from the `requests` package, specifically dealing with HTTP and HTTPS connections, socket handling, and connection pooling. These files contain spans of code that are responsible for making network connections, handling timeouts, and managing SSL/TLS connections. The relevant spans identified include the HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, the WrappedSocket class in `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py`, and the urlopen method in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`. These spans are relevant because they are directly involved in the network operations that could raise socket.error exceptions, and they should be modified to catch and wrap such exceptions accordingly. Specifically, the HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes should catch socket.error exceptions and raise ConnectionError exceptions instead. Additionally, the WrappedSocket class should handle socket errors appropriately, perhaps by translating them into requests-specific exceptions as well. Finally, the urlopen method in connectionpool.py should ensure that any socket errors encountered during the connection process are properly wrapped and handled.",

The `connection.py` module defines classes like `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPSConnection` which handle low-level socket operations. The `connectionpool.py` module, which manages connections in pools, also handles exceptions like `SocketError` and `TimeoutError`. The `contrib.pyopenssl.py` module extends the default SSL functionality and deals with low-level socket operations for secure connections. These modules collectively handle various aspects of socket communication and error handling, which are critical for addressing the issue of unhandled socket errors. Therefore, based on the file context provided, it seems that all relevant areas for addressing the issue are present, indicating that the file context is complete.",
