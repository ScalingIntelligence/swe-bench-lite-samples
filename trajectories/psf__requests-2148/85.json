This suggests that the code in the `requests` library and its dependencies (like `urllib3`) should handle and translate these low-level errors into more specific `requests` exceptions. Analyzing the provided search results, especially parts of the `requests` and `urllib3` packages that deal with HTTP response handling and socket communication, is crucial to identify sections where such error handling is implemented or should be implemented. The code spans in the `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` file are particularly relevant, as they include methods like `HTTPResponse.read()` and `HTTPResponse.stream()`, which directly interact with socket data reading and could potentially catch socket errors and translate them into higher-level exceptions. In addition, the `WrappedSocket` class in the `pyopenssl.py` module handles low-level socket operations and also needs to be examined for error translation. Identifying these specific code spans will help in determining where to implement the needed error handling.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that a socket error (specifically a 'Connection reset by peer') is being raised directly without being caught and wrapped in a requests exception (like requests.exceptions.ConnectionError). The traceback provided shows that the error is occurring during the reading of data from the socket, specifically in the 'recv' method of the socket. This suggests that there might be a need to improve error handling in the 'recv' method to catch socket errors and re-raise them as a more appropriate exception from the requests library.\n\nThe search results include relevant parts of the code responsible for handling socket communication and data reading. Specifically, the 'HTTPResponse.read' and 'WrappedSocket.recv' methods are relevant. The 'HTTPResponse.read' method handles reading data from the socket and decoding the content. It currently catches and handles SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, and HTTPException, but does not explicitly handle general socket errors like 'Connection reset by peer'. Similarly, the 'WrappedSocket.recv' method in 'pyopenssl.py' catches and handles specific OpenSSL errors but does not handle general socket errors. Both methods could be extended to catch and handle socket errors, potentially wrapping them in a requests-specific exception like ConnectionError.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans to address this issue would be in the error handling portions of both 'HTTPResponse.read' in 'response.py' and 'WrappedSocket.recv' in 'pyopenssl.py'. The task is not yet complete as improvements are needed in the mentioned code spans to better handle and wrap socket errors.",
