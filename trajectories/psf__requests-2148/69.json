This can be a result of insufficient error handling in the part of the codebase that interacts with the network. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs when reading data from a socket, specifically in the `recv` method. To resolve this, we need to locate areas where socket errors can occur and ensure they are properly handled and wrapped in a requests exception like `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Given the stack trace, it is likely that the error handling in the `requests` library or in the code using it needs to be reviewed. We should also consider the error types defined in `requests/exceptions.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` to ensure proper exception wrapping. Additionally, focusing on the `HTTPConnectionPool`, `HTTPConnection`, and `HTTPResponse` classes in `urllib3` will be crucial for implementing robust error handling.",

This suggests that the code responsible for handling network errors in the 'requests' library needs to be modified to catch 'socket.error' exceptions and re-raise them as 'ConnectionError'. The search results include several relevant files and code spans that are central to this issue. Notably, the 'requests/exceptions.py' file defines the 'ConnectionError' class, which is the ideal exception type to use for wrapping 'socket.error'. Additionally, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' file contains the code responsible for creating and managing HTTP connections, including the '_new_conn' method where the socket connection is initiated. This method is the likely location for catching and wrapping 'socket.error' exceptions. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py' file is also relevant as it deals with SSL/TLS connections and might handle or propagate 'socket.error' exceptions. The other files and methods listed, such as 'connectionpool.py' and 'response.py', handle various aspects of HTTP requests and responses but are less directly related to the immediate issue of exception handling. However, they provide context and potential points where 'socket.error' might occur and where additional handling could be implemented. Ultimately, the identified code spans in 'connection.py' and 'exceptions.py' are the most pertinent for addressing the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a raw `socket.error` being raised instead of a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` when a socket reset occurs. This suggests that the error handling in the `requests` library may be insufficient to catch and convert certain low-level socket errors into more appropriate `requests` exceptions. Given this, the task is to identify sections of code in the `requests` library that handle or should handle socket errors and ensure they are appropriately wrapped in `requests` exceptions.\n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue: The issue specifically mentions a raw `socket.error` being raised, which should ideally be caught and re-raised as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This means we need to focus on code spans that deal with socket operations and error handling.\n\n2. Reviewing the current file context: The provided file context shows definitions of `RequestException`, `ConnectionError`, `ProxyError`, and `SSLError` in `requests/exceptions.py`. These are the candidate exceptions that should be used to wrap socket errors. Additionally, there are spans of code in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py` that deal with socket operations and may need to handle socket errors.\n\n3. Processing new search results: The new search results provide additional code spans in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py`. The focus should be on the `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPSConnection` classes and their `_new_conn`, `_prepare_conn`, `connect`, and `recv` methods. These methods handle socket creation and data reception, which are likely places where `socket.error` exceptions could occur and should be caught and wrapped.\n\n4. Identified relevant code spans: The identified spans include methods that handle socket connections (`_new_conn`, `connect`) and data reception (`recv`). These are critical areas where a `socket.error` could occur and should be caught and wrapped in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.",

This indicates that the error handling for socket-related issues in the requests library might not be sufficient. The existing context and search results show that the requests library indeed has a specific ConnectionError class that extends RequestException, which is designed to handle various types of request errors. However, the specific handling of socket errors within the ConnectionError class or its subclasses is not explicitly shown in the provided context. Diving deeper into the search results, we find that in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, there is a method `_new_conn` that attempts to create a new connection and catches a `SocketTimeout`, raising a `ConnectTimeoutError`. This suggests a specific handling for one type of socket-related error but does not show how other socket errors like 'Connection reset by peer' are handled. Similarly, in `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py`, the `WrappedSocket.recv` method handles `OpenSSL.SSL.SysCallError`, specifically for 'Unexpected EOF', but does not explicitly handle general socket errors and does not raise a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Therefore, to address the reported issue, it seems necessary to include handling for socket.error in a way that it raises a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, providing a more consistent and user-friendly error handling approach throughout the library. The identified relevant code spans include the `_new_conn` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` for its potential to add socket error handling, and the `recv` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py` for its existing SSL-specific error handling, suggesting where enhancements might be needed.",
