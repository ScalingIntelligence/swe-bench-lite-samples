This suggests a need to review how exceptions are being handled within the context of network operations using the requests library. Given the search results, several potential areas of interest emerge: 1. The `HTTPConnection` and `HTTPSConnection` classes in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` where socket connections are directly managed. 2. The `HTTPConnectionPool` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` which orchestrates the use of these connections and their exceptions. 3. The `HTTPResponse` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` which processes responses and may need to handle or propagate connection exceptions. 4. The `HTTPAdapter` class in `requests/adapters.py` which is responsible for sending requests and could also be involved in exception handling related to connections. These classes and their methods might need modifications or additional exception handling to meet the user's expectation of having `socket.error` exceptions wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.",

This could involve modifying the existing code to catch socket.error and re-raise it as a ConnectionError from the requests library. After analyzing the provided code, it appears that the HTTPConnectionPool class in the connectionpool.py file already has methods to handle such exceptions and could potentially be an appropriate place to implement the necessary changes. Additionally, the HTTPAdapter class in adapters.py also deals with exception handling and might require adjustments to properly wrap socket.error. A detailed examination of these classes suggests that further modifications could be necessary in the _make_request method of HTTPConnectionPool and the send method of HTTPAdapter, to integrate more robust exception handling.",

The provided traceback shows that the raw `socket.error` is being raised when a connection is reset by the peer. This suggests a need to enhance error handling within the `requests` library to catch and wrap such `socket.error` instances in a `ConnectionError`. The identified relevant files and spans in the first context include `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` which is crucial for understanding how connections are managed and where potential errors like `socket.error` can occur. The second context provides additional files `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` and `requests/adapters.py`, which are also relevant as they handle connection establishment and the sending of HTTP requests respectively. In the new search results, the `HTTPConnectionPool` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` and the `HTTPAdapter` class in `requests/adapters.py` provide more detailed context on how connections are managed and the process of sending HTTP requests. These results confirm the relevance of the initial file context and provide further insight into where improvements in error handling for `socket.error` could be implemented.",
