The search results provided contain several key files and spans that are relevant to this issue. Notably, the `HTTPResponse` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` handles reading and streaming of responses, which could potentially raise socket errors. The `HTTPConnectionPool` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` is also relevant, as it manages connections and handles URL opening, which could involve socket operations. Additionally, the `HTTPAdapter` class in `requests/adapters.py` is involved in sending requests, making it a potential location for handling socket errors. Other files like `poolmanager.py`, `sessions.py`, and `request.py` also play roles in managing requests and responses, and should be examined for proper error handling.
