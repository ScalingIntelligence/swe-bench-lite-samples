This suggests that the handling of socket errors might be missing or inadequate in the requests library's internals. To address this, we should search for areas in the code where socket errors might occur and ensure they are properly wrapped in requests exceptions. This includes examining the parts of the library that interact with network connections, such as the HTTPConnectionPool, adapters, and response handling. Specifically, focusing on the 'recv' and 'connect' methods in the connection and connection pool modules would be prudent. Additionally, looking at how exceptions are handled generally across relevant modules could provide insights.",

This suggests that there might be a need to improve exception handling within the codebase. The search results provide several relevant sections of the code that could be used to address this issue. Specifically, the 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen' section shows a distinct handling of different exceptions, but does not explicitly catch and wrap socket.error into a requests exception. Similarly, the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method more comprehensively handles various exceptions, including a direct mapping of socket.error to ConnectionError. This suggests that the 'requests/adapters.py' file, particularly the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method, is the most relevant and potentially the location to implement the desired fix, as it currently handles exceptions that align with the issue at hand. Hence, the identified relevant code spans are in the 'requests/adapters.py' file.",
