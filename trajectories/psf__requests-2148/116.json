The stack trace indicates that the error is occurring at a lower level, specifically in the `urllib3` and `socket` modules. To address this, we need to look into the handling of socket errors within the relevant parts of the requests library. We should focus on the `requests/models.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, and potentially other related files where the code interacts with socket-level details. Additionally, the presence of exception handling in `requests/exceptions.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` suggests that exceptions might be explicitly defined or caught in those areas.",

To address this, we need to identify where in the `requests` library the `socket.error` might be occurring and ensure that it is caught and transformed into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The provided search results include several key files such as `connectionpool.py`, `response.py`, `adapters.py`, and `models.py`. These files contain the core logic of handling connections, responses, and exceptions within the `requests` library. By examining specific code spans, particularly those involving socket operations (e.g., `socket.recv` in `connectionpool.py`) and exception handling, we can identify potential locations to implement or enhance the exception wrapping.\n\n1. In `connectionpool.py`, the method `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` is crucial as it handles making HTTP requests and could potentially encounter a `socket.error` during the read operation. This span should be marked as relevant because it directly deals with socket interactions and needs to be reviewed for exception handling.\n\n2. Similarly, in `response.py`, the `HTTPResponse.read` method is critical because it contains logic for reading data from the HTTP response, which could also lead to a `socket.error` if a connection issue occurs. Ensuring proper exception handling around socket operations in this method is important.\n\n3. The `HTTPAdapter.send` method in `adapters.py` orchestrates the sending of requests and could also be a place where a `socket.error` might occur, particularly during the connection and data transfer phases. It is relevant for checking and possibly enhancing exception management around these operations.\n\n4. `PoolManager.urlopen` in `poolmanager.py` is another vantage point from which HTTP connections are managed, suggesting that it could also be a locus for `socket.error` instances that should be revised to fit the reported issue's resolution.",

The key files to look at are `requests/adapters.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`. In `requests/adapters.py`, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method catches `socket.error` and raises `ConnectionError`, which aligns with the issue. In `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method also catches `SocketError` and raises `ReadTimeoutError`, which indirectly addresses the issue of socket errors being caught. Similarly, in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, `HTTPResponse.read` catches `SocketTimeout` and raises `ReadTimeoutError`. These spans of code show where socket-related errors are caught and wrapped into `requests` or `urllib3` specific exceptions, addressing the reported issue.",
