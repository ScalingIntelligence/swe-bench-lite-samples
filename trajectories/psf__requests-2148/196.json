Given this, the task is to identify code spans that are relevant for handling or wrapping socket errors in the requests library in a way that aligns with the user's expectation. From the search results, several key areas appear relevant: \n\n1. The 'ConnectionError' exception class in 'requests/exceptions.py' is a direct match for the desired type of exception wrapping a lower-level error. \n\n2. The 'HTTPAdapter' class in 'requests/adapters.py' is significant because it handles actual HTTP connection operations. Particularly relevant methods within this class are 'send', 'get_connection', and 'build_response', as they manage the connection and response processes where a socket error might occur. \n\n3. The 'HTTPConnection' and 'HTTPConnectionPool' classes in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' are lower-level implementations directly involved in handling connections and might provide deeper insight into where and how socket errors are generated and optionally caught. \n\nGiven these findings, it is clear that the 'ConnectionError' class is relevant for defining the exception type, and the 'HTTPAdapter', particularly its 'send' method, is a focal point for ensuring that socket errors are either caught or wrapped into higher-level exceptions like 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'.",
