To address this, I need to identify relevant parts of the code where socket errors might be occurring during the handling of HTTP responses. The provided search results include parts of the code from 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' and 'requests/models.py'. Although these files are related to handling HTTP responses, none of the code spans directly catch or handle socket errors specifically yet. I need to select the portions of code in both files that are crucial for handling responses and streaming data, as they are likely places where socket errors might initially manifest.",
