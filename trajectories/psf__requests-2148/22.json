To address this, we need to identify parts of the code where socket.error might be caught and possibly wrapped in a ConnectionError. The provided search results include several relevant code spans from the 'requests' library, particularly in 'requests/exceptions.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py'. In 'requests/exceptions.py', we see definitions of various exception classes, including ConnectionError, which would be suitable for wrapping the socket.error. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', there is a comprehensive handling of various exceptions including SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, and HTTPException, but no explicit handling for socket.error. This indicates a possible gap that the reported issue is pointing to. In 'requests/adapters.py', there is a detailed send method that catches socket.error and raises ConnectionError, which seems to be correctly handling the problem described in the issue after all. Based on these findings, it appears that the necessary exception wrapping is already in place in 'requests/adapters.py', but the initial analysis of 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' highlighted areas that might benefit from additional exception handling, especially around the potential to catch and re-raise socket.error with a more appropriate exception type.",
