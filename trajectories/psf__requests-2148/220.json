This suggests that the error handling within the requests library might not be properly wrapping socket errors. The search results from `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` are relevant because they deal directly with network operations and error handling within the requests package. In `response.py`, the `HTTPResponse.read` method handles various exceptions including `SocketTimeout` and `HTTPException`, but does not explicitly handle `socket.error`. Similarly, in `connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method handles several exceptions including `SocketError`, but again, does not wrap it in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. These sections of code likely need to be updated to catch and wrap `socket.error` instances with a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` to provide a more consistent and user-friendly experience.",
