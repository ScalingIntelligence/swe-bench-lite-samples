In `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, the `HTTPResponse.read` method catches several exceptions like `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `HTTPException`, but does not seem to catch `socket.error`. Similarly, in `requests/models.py`, the `Response.iter_content` method catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError`, but not `socket.error`. Finally, in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method catches `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `SocketError`, but again, does not catch `socket.error`. These spans are relevant because they handle various exceptions but miss `socket.error`, which aligns with the reported issue.
