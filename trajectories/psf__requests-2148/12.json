This could be due to missing or insufficient exception handling in the areas where network connections are managed. Given the stack trace, it's likely that the error occurs during the processing of an HTTP response, possibly in the reading or streaming of response content. The search should focus on the relevant areas of the requests library where network connections and responses are handled, with a specific emphasis on the modules dealing with HTTP response processing and connection management. It might also be beneficial to look into where socket errors could be directly managed or where ConnectionError exceptions should be raised.",
