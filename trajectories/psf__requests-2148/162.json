The analysis focuses on identifying the relevant code spans where this error handling can be improved. There are several key files and spans of code that are relevant to this issue. Firstly, in 'requests/exceptions.py', we have the definition of 'ConnectionError' which is a subclass of 'RequestException'. This is where we would ideally catch and wrap the socket errors. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', the 'HTTPResponse.read' method handles various exceptions including 'SocketTimeout' and 'BaseSSLError', but does not handle 'socket.error'. Enhancing this method to include 'socket.error' and raise a 'ConnectionError' would address the issue. Additionally, in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', the 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen' method also handles various exceptions but does not specifically handle 'socket.error'. Enhancing this method to catch 'socket.error' and raise a 'ConnectionError' would also contribute to the solution. These identified spans of code are crucial for enhancing error handling to catch and wrap 'socket.error' in a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'.",

The provided context shows where the `ConnectionError` exception is defined in `requests/exceptions.py`. The search results largely revolve around the `requests.packages.urllib3` package, which is crucial for handling HTTP requests within the `requests` library. The key areas to focus on include the handling of socket errors and timeouts within `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` and `HTTPResponse.read` methods in `connectionpool.py` and `response.py`, respectively. These methods are essential for making HTTP requests and reading responses, making them likely candidates for implementing the necessary exception handling to catch and wrap `socket.error` into `ConnectionError`. Additionally, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method in `adapters.py` is relevant as it orchestrates the sending of requests. However, further examination of the code within these methods is needed to pinpoint the exact location(s) where `socket.error` should be caught and handled appropriately.",

The 'requests' module defines RequestException and its subclass ConnectionError to handle various HTTP-related exceptions including socket errors. The 'urllib3' module also handles exceptions such as SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, HTTPException, etc., which are crucial for network connectivity issues. Although the specific 'socket.error' related to 'Connection reset by peer' is not explicitly handled in the provided code, the infrastructure is present to catch, wrap, and handle such errors. This suggests that developers can extend or enhance the existing error handling mechanisms to specifically address 'Connection reset by peer' at the appropriate locations. Therefore, while the exact handling of this specific socket error is not present, the foundation to implement such handling is clearly available.",
