Also, checking the exceptions module to ensure that socket errors are properly wrapped in a ConnectionError is important.",

This is particularly relevant in the context of socket operations during HTTP connections. The search results reveal sections of code where socket operations are handled, especially in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, and `requests/adapters.py`. In these files, the code handles various exceptions but does not explicitly wrap `socket.error` into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The relevant spans identified include sections dealing with socket connections and exception handling, such as `HTTPConnection._new_conn` and `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` in the connection and connection pool modules. Additionally, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method in `requests/adapters.py` is a critical part dealing with sending requests and handling exceptions. These sections are likely places where modifications to handle and wrap `socket.error` are needed. By examining these areas, we can identify and suggest improvements to ensure robust error handling and consistent behavior throughout the library when dealing with socket errors.",
