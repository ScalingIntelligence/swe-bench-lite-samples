This implies that the error handling in the requests library might not be properly wrapping low-level socket errors into higher-level requests exceptions. To address this, it's essential to identify where in the requests library exceptions are defined and where they might be used for wrapping socket errors. The search results contain definitions of various exceptions in the requests library, such as ConnectionError, which is the type of exception that should ideally be raised instead of a raw socket error. Therefore, these exception definitions are relevant to addressing the reported issue. After examining the definitions of exceptions in the `requests/exceptions.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` files, I found that the exception definitions align well with what might be necessary to implement the desired error handling. Specifically, the 'ConnectionError' class in `requests/exceptions.py` seems like the appropriate place to start for wrapping socket errors into requests errors. Identifying these spans allows for a focused approach to solving the problem.",

The initial traceback indicates that the socket.error is being raised directly, rather than being re-raised as a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. This suggests a need to modify the code to ensure that socket errors are properly caught and wrapped in the appropriate requests exception.\n\nThe file_context and search_results contain several relevant files and code spans, especially in the 'requests/exceptions.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' files. These files define the exception hierarchy, including ConnectionError, and the methods in connectionpool.py handle actual HTTP connections, where socket errors are likely to occur. The 'HTTPConnectionPool' class and its 'urlopen' method are critical, as they manage connections and are likely the place where the error handling needs to be improved. Additionally, the 'HTTPAdapter' class in 'requests/adapters.py' is responsible for sending requests, making it another relevant location for potential error handling improvements.\n\nThe identified code spans in 'requests/exceptions.py' specify the exception hierarchy, including subclasses like ConnectionError, which should be used to wrap socket errors. The spans in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' show where HTTP connections are managed and where current error handling might be insufficient, as indicated by the reported issue. Finally, the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method in 'requests/adapters.py' handles sending requests, indicating another potential place for improving error handling.\n\nBased on these analyses, the relevant code spans have been identified, particularly those related to defining and handling errors, and managing HTTP connections, which should address the reported issue.",
