I need to look for code sections that handle or propagate exceptions, particularly focusing on `socket.error`. From the provided context and search results, I see that the `HTTPConnectionPool` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` and the `HTTPConnection` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` handle connections and could potentially catch or propagate socket errors. I will focus on these sections to find where the `socket.error` exceptions are raised or could be handled.\n\nIn the `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method, there is a detailed exception handling block where `SocketError` and `SocketTimeout` are caught and handled. This section seems relevant because it directly addresses socket-related errors and might be missing wrapping a `socket.error` in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, as described in the issue. Additionally, the `HTTPConnection._new_conn` method is where a new connection is attempted, and any socket-related errors would likely occur here, which hasn't been directly addressed yet in the context provided. I will extract the relevant spans from these sections.",

The provided search results contain relevant code spans in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`. These files handle HTTP and HTTPS connections and include sections that deal with socket errors and timeouts. Notably, the HTTPConnectionPool class in `connectionpool.py` contains methods for making requests, validating connections, and handling timeouts, which are pertinent to the issue of not catching socket errors at the appropriate level. The HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes in `connection.py` also handle connection establishment and socket-related operations. The search results also include the definition of ConnectionError in `requests/exceptions.py`, which confirms the existence of the exception type that should be used to wrap socket errors. Based on these findings, the identified code spans seem relevant to addressing the issue, particularly those dealing with error handling and socket operations in the connection pooling and connection classes.

These elements are critical for determining if 'socket.error' is appropriately caught and translated into 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. However, the provided context does not explicitly show a handler within 'requests' itself that catches 'socket.error' and translates it directly or as a default case as suggested by the reported issue.
