To address this, we need to identify the parts of the codebase where `socket.error` may be raised and ensure they are properly handled and wrapped in the appropriate `requests.exceptions` such as `ConnectionError`. After analyzing the search results, it is evident that the `requests/exceptions.py` file defines the `ConnectionError` class that we want to use for wrapping `socket.error` instances. Also, the `requests/adapters.py` file contains the `HTTPAdapter.send` method which is involved in sending requests and might handle or need to handle `socket.error` exceptions. Additionally, `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` includes `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` which directly interacts with the socket. These parts of the code are likely to need adjustments to handle and wrap Network-related errors.",
