The error occurred during the handling of an HTTP response, and the stack trace provides insights into the specific lines and files involved. Given the stack trace, the primary focus should be on the `requests` library and its interaction with socket operations. The relevant files identified from the stack trace and additional context include various modules within the `requests` library and its urllib3 packaged. The current context suggests that the search should focus on these specific files to find where the socket error might be raised and not handled or wrapped by a requests exception. This might involve looking into the connection management, response handling, or exception wrapping functionalities within the `requests` library and urllib3.",

The reported issue suggests that the exception handling might be lacking in certain parts of the code, particularly when dealing with socket-level errors during HTTP communication. Analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans where socket errors might occur and need additional exception handling include:\n\n1. requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py - Specifically the '_make_request' method within the 'HTTPConnectionPool' class where the HTTP request is made and where socket errors could occur.\n2. requests/packages/urllib3/response.py - Relevant for handling HTTP responses, especially in the 'read' and 'stream' methods of the 'HTTPResponse' class, which involve reading from sockets.\n3. requests/adapters.py - The 'send' method in the 'HTTPAdapter' class is critical as it manages sending requests, including handling potential socket errors.\n\nThese sections of the code handle network operations and socket communication, making them prime candidates for modification to include the necessary try-except blocks to catch socket.error and raise a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError.",

The `HTTPConnectionPool` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` directly handles `SocketTimeout` and `SocketError`, converting them into `ReadTimeoutError`. Similarly, the `HTTPResponse` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` handles `SocketTimeout` and `BaseSSLError` but does not explicitly handle `socket.error`. Additionally, the `HTTPAdapter` class in `requests/adapters.py` catches `socket.error` and raises `ConnectionError`, aligning with the desired behavior of wrapping raw socket errors in a more specific request exception. Given these findings, it appears that while handling for some socket errors is present, more comprehensive handling might be needed.

Similarly, `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` showcases reading and decoding response data with specific handling for timeouts and protocol errors. In `requests/adapters.py`, the `HTTPAdapter` class sends requests and manages exceptions, converting underlying socket errors into `ConnectionError`. Given this context and the requirement to ensure comprehensive handling of `socket.error` across the library, further investigations should focus on expanding the search to other parts of the `requests` library not covered in the provided context. Specifically, we need to look into how other modules interact with and potentially handle or propagate `socket.error` exceptions. This includes examining the exception handling mechanisms in `requests/models.py` where the `Response` class is defined, as well as in other possible integration points with dependencies like urllib3 and potentially other third-party libraries involved in handling HTTP connections and responses. The search should also consider broader patterns of exception propagation and wrapping up the call stack during HTTP operations.",

This suggests the need to catch and handle socket errors more effectively within the requests library. The following steps were taken to address this:\n1. Analyzed the reported issue to understand that the focus is on improving error handling for socket errors, particularly the 'Connection reset by peer' error, by wrapping them in a requests-specific exception.\n2. Reviewed the current file context to understand where socket errors might currently be handled and identified the following relevant code spans within the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' files; however, it appears that the existing handling of socket errors might not be extensive enough to cover all cases or might be raising raw errors under specific conditions.\n3. Processed the new search results to find more detailed handling of socket errors:\n   - 'requests/adapters.py': This file includes the HTTPAdapter class, specifically the 'send' method where socket errors are caught and converted into ConnectionError exceptions. This is consistent with the request to wrap raw socket errors.\n   - 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py': Contains detailed logic for connection pools, including how errors like SocketTimeout are handled; there is potential to handle similar cases for socket errors.\n   - 'requests/models.py': The Response class and its methods show how response content is handled, including iteration of content and dealing with incomplete reads or decoding errors, which might indicate places where socket errors could interrupt the flow and need proper exception handling.\n   - 'requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py': The Retry class handles various types of errors, including ConnectTimeoutError and ReadTimeoutError, illustrating an approach to managing and recovering from problematic network conditions.\nBased on the analysis, the following code spans have been identified as highly relevant to the reported issue, offering insight into where improvements or additional checks might be needed to ensure that all socket errors are appropriately wrapped in requests-specific exceptions:\n- 'HTTPAdapter.send': Direct handling of socket errors.\n- 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request': Existing handling of SocketTimeout and other errors that could likely be extended.\n- 'HTTPResponse.read': Reading and handling of response content, likely to be impacted by connection resets.\nThis exercise aims to document relevant code parts for further investigation or potential fixes in line with the reported issue's requirements.",

In `requests/adapters.py`, the `HTTPAdapter` class sends requests and manages exceptions, converting underlying socket errors into `ConnectionError`. Given this context and the requirement to ensure comprehensive handling of `socket.error` across the library, further investigations should focus on expanding the search to other parts of the `requests` library not covered in the provided context. Specifically, we need to look into how other modules interact with and potentially handle or propagate `socket.error` exceptions. This includes examining the exception handling mechanisms in `requests/models.py` where the `Response` class is defined, as well as in other possible integration points with dependencies like urllib3 and potentially other third-party libraries involved in handling HTTP connections and responses. The search should also consider broader patterns of exception propagation and wrapping up the call stack during HTTP operations.",

Specifically, the `requests/models.py` file should be investigated to understand how the `Response` class processes and possibly wraps exceptions during HTTP response handling.

From the provided file context, the relevant files to focus on are `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, as they contain methods dealing with connection handling and response reading where socket errors could occur. In the new search results, `requests/adapters.py` and `requests/models.py` also show relevant sections dealing with HTTP and response handling, suggesting potential locations for handling or propagating such exceptions. Specifically, in `requests/adapters.py`, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method catches socket errors and raises a ConnectionError, which aligns with the issue report. In `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request` method handles socket timeouts and various HTTP exceptions, which could be modeled to include the handling of socket errors more comprehensively. Additionally, the `HTTPResponse.read` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` also directly addresses handling of socket and connection errors during the reading of HTTP responses. These sections indicate areas that should be assessed and possibly modified to ensure that all socket errors, including reset errors, are consistently and appropriately handled by raising requests' ConnectionError or a similar custom exception.",

In `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, there's extensive handling for various errors like `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `SocketError`, which are often re-raised as more specific errors such as `ReadTimeoutError`. In `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, the `HTTPResponse` class manages exception handling during reading of response data, showing error catching for `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `HTTPException`, among others. The `requests/adapters.py` shows how the `HTTPAdapter` converts lower-level socket errors into higher-level `ConnectionError` exceptions, which the `requests` library uses. The focus should now shift to examining how these error handling mechanisms are integrated across other parts of the `requests` library and possibly other third-party integrations. Specifically, the `requests/models.py` file should be investigated to understand how the `Response` class processes and possibly wraps exceptions during HTTP response handling. Additionally, it would be beneficial to check for any intercept points where incoming `socket.error` might be overlooked or improperly handled, especially considering the complexity of HTTP connection management and response processing in these libraries.",
