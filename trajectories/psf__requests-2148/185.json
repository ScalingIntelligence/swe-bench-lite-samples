The relevant code spans are found in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' where the HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes are defined, including their connect methods which call `_new_conn` and handle the creation of new connections. Additionally, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file contains the HTTPConnectionPool class with methods like '_new_conn', '_get_conn', and '_make_request', which are responsible for managing the connection pool and making HTTP requests. Also, the 'requests/adapters.py' file, specifically the HTTPAdapter class and its 'send' method, manage the sending of requests through the prepared connections. These sections of code are likely where the handling of socket errors should be integrated to raise a ConnectionError from the 'requests.exceptions' module instead of letting the socket.error propagate directly. This process is crucial for maintaining the expected behavior with the requests library, enhancing error handling capabilities, and ensuring that users receive exceptions that are contextually appropriate for the library's usage.",
