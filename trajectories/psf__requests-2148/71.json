The issue specifically mentions a socket reset leading to a raw socket error, which should ideally be wrapped in a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. In the search results, I focused on the `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` files, where the handling of connections and errors seemed most pertinent. Within these files, I identified spans that dealt with connection handling and exception management. Notably, the `requests/exceptions.py` file defines the `ConnectionError` class, which is the target exception for wrapping socket errors. However, in the provided code, there isn't explicit logic to catch socket errors and rethrow them as `ConnectionError`. This gap suggests where the enhancement might be needed. I also looked at `HTTPConnection`, `HTTPConnectionPool`, and their methods in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, which are critical in handling HTTP/HTTPS connections, including potential for socket errors. Therefore, the identified spans in these files could be relevant for addressing the issue.",
