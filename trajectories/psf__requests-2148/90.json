This suggests that the error handling in the requests library might not be properly wrapping socket errors. First, I'll search for the occurrence of the 'socket.error' in the context of the requests library to identify where it might not be properly wrapped or handled. Additionally, I'll look for specific error handling code in the requests library to ensure that it's robust enough to catch lower-level network errors like 'socket.error'.",

This suggests that the code responsible for handling the socket connections and their potential errors within the requests library may need adjustments to properly catch and rethrow these exceptions using the correct requests-specific exceptions. Looking at the search results, several relevant sections of the codebase have been identified that involve handling of socket connections and potential errors during HTTP/HTTPS requests. These include connection pool management, handling of timeouts, and the direct handling of socket errors. Specifically, the code in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and 'requests/adapters.py' appear particularly relevant due to their direct involvement in managing connections, handling exceptions, and making HTTP requests through the use of adapters. These sections of the code are likely places where the wrapping of socket errors, such as a connection reset, in requests-specific exceptions like ConnectionError could be enhanced.",
