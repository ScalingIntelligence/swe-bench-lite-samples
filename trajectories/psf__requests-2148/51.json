This suggests that the code should be modified to catch socket errors and re-raise them as more specific requests exceptions. I analyzed the search results and identified several code spans that are relevant to this issue. These include methods and classes from urllib3 that handle connections, request making, and error handling. Specifically, the HTTPConnectionPool class in urllib3/connectionpool.py deals with connection management and request making, which are directly related to the reported issue. Additionally, the Retry class in urllib3/util/retry.py handles retry logic which might need adjustment to include handling of socket errors. Furthermore, the HTTPConnection class in urllib3/connection.py and the HTTPAdapter class in requests/adapters.py are also relevant as they manage HTTP connections and sending requests, respectively. Finally, the HTTPResponse class in urllib3/response.py is involved in handling HTTP responses which might also be where exceptions from lower-level errors propagate.",
