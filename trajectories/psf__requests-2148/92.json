This indicates a gap in the exception handling mechanism within the `requests` library or its dependencies. The provided stack trace and relevant files suggest that the problem could be occurring in the connection handling, response processing, or exception handling parts of the `requests` library. To address this, we need to focus our search on the areas of the code that handle or propagate exceptions related to socket errors, particularly where the `requests` library interacts with the underlying network communication components.",

The provided search results contain multiple files from the 'requests' library, particularly focusing on the 'urllib3' module which is used internally by 'requests'. Key sections include the 'HTTPConnectionPool' class in 'connectionpool.py', the 'HTTPResponse' class in 'response.py', and the 'HTTPAdapter' class in 'adapters.py'. These sections deal with making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing connections respectively, where socket errors might originate. Given the complexity of error handling in these classes, it's important to inspect areas where socket errors could occur, such as in the '_make_request' method of 'HTTPConnectionPool', or within the 'read' method of 'HTTPResponse'. Additionally, the 'HTTPAdapter' class manages retries and sending requests where error handling strategies are defined. These sections are crucial to understand how socket errors are currently handled and how they might be improved to align with the expectation of catching and wrapping them in 'requests' exceptions.",

The issue relates to the handling of socket errors during HTTP requests, specifically whether they are appropriately wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. In `adapters.py`, an `HTTPAdapter` class method `send` exists that captures `socket.error` and raises `ConnectionError`. Additionally, in `connectionpool.py`, the `_make_request` method and in `response.py`, the `read` method, socket errors are being handled and transformed into more specific exceptions like `ReadTimeoutError`, aligning with the handling of other exceptions (like `BaseSSLError`, `SocketTimeout`, etc.). The code provided indicates an intention to handle low-level exceptions and raise higher-level, more meaningful ones, potentially including `ConnectionError`.
