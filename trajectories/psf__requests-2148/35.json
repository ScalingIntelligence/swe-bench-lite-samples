Given the stack trace and the fact that the error occurs during the reading of response content in the requests library, we should focus our search on the files and methods related to handling network requests and responses, especially those dealing with content streaming and decoding. The stack trace provides clues about where the error originates, notably in the requests.models.Response class and the urllib3 components used by requests, such as urllib3.response.HTTPResponse and urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool.

In `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method catches several types of exceptions, including `SocketError`, and handles them appropriately by incrementing retries and sleeping. This section is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the handling of socket errors within the context of HTTP connections. Additionally, the `HTTPResponse.read` and `HTTPResponse.stream` methods in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` are relevant as they handle the reading and streaming of responses, which could also involve socket errors. The `Response.iter_content` method in `requests/models.py` is also relevant as it involves streaming content and could handle socket errors.

Specifically, the HTTPConnectionPool class in urllib3/connectionpool.py handles network connections and requests, and the HTTPResponse class in urllib3/response.py manages the reading and decoding of response content. The Response class in requests/models.py also deals with content streaming. These sections of the code are directly related to the areas where the socket.error exception is raised, as indicated by the stack trace in the issue. Given this, the relevant parts of the codebase for enhancing error handling around socket operations are present in the file context. Further, there are also sections in the code that handle various exceptions including SocketError and HTTPException, which suggests that the base for modifying or enhancing error handling is available. However, it's essential to ensure that a transformation or wrapping of raw socket errors (like Errno 104) into a more user-friendly error (like requests.exceptions.ConnectionError) is done explicitly in the code during the handling process to fully meet the requirement of the issue. This aspect, although mentioned in the scratch pad for consideration, is not explicitly found applied in the provided file code. Thus, while we have significant parts of the code context necessary for the modification to address the issue, an actual implementation of the suggestion where socket errors are wrapped in a 'ConnectionError' is not seen.

The file_context provided includes the relevant file spans from connectionpool.py, response.py, and requests/models.py where the handling of socket errors and their transformation into requests exceptions may need to be implemented. Specifically, the connectionpool.py file handles SocketError exceptions, but they are not currently being wrapped into requests.exceptions.ConnectionError, which suggests this transformation may need to be done in the requests library itself.
