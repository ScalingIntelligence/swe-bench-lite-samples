This suggests a lack of proper exception handling and wrapping within the requests library code. Given the stack trace and the context provided, it is logical to search for areas where socket errors are being handled or propagated, particularly in the files associated with requests and urllib3. I will start by searching for occurrences of 'socket.error' and related exception handling in the identified files.",

I will analyze the search results to identify the relevant code spans that handle exceptions within the requests library. The key code spans to look for are those that define the `ConnectionError` exception and any related handling mechanisms. Additionally, I will look for code that might directly catch or handle `socket.error` to check if it is properly wrapped in a requests exception. From the search results, the file `requests/exceptions.py` contains the definition of `ConnectionError` as a subclass of `RequestException` within the requests library. In the file `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py`, there are sections that handle socket connections and could potentially catch `socket.error`. Finally, in `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`, there are definitions of various HTTP exceptions, including `ConnectTimeoutError`, which is relevant if the issue relates to a timeout or connection issue. The identified code spans should help in determining how to modify the code to properly wrap `socket.error` in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` exception.",

This suggests a need to enhance error handling within the requests library to catch and wrap socket errors appropriately.\n\nGiven the current context, two files are relevant: 'requests/exceptions.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py'. The first file already defines the ConnectionError exception that should be used to wrap socket errors. The second file contains the connection logic where the socket errors might occur.\n\nNew search results confirm the presence of connection logic in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py', specifically in the connect method of HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes. This is where socket errors might be triggered and should be caught and wrapped.\n\nAdditionally, 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' includes various exceptions including ConnectionError. Integration of these exceptions with the connection handling logic is crucial to ensure proper error propagation and user-friendly error messages.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code spans include the connect methods in HTTPConnection, HTTPSConnection, and VerifiedHTTPSConnection classes in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py'. These areas are identified as critical for implementing the required error handling.\n\nNo additional references to other parts of the codebase that could be relevant were found. Thus, the identified spans are assumed to be sufficient to begin implementing the solution.",
