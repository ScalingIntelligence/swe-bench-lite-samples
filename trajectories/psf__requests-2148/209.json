The provided search results include several potential areas where this might be handled: specifically, the `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` file contains multiple spans of code that deal with connections and potential errors. Notably, the `_make_request` method in the `HTTPConnectionPool` class is a likely place to start, as it handles the actual request and has potential points for catching a `socket.error`. Additionally, the `send` method in `requests/adapters.py` might also be relevant as it orchestrates the sending of requests.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, it's important to examine the entire context of these functions to ensure that not only are `socket.error` exceptions being caught, but also properly wrapped into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` exception.
