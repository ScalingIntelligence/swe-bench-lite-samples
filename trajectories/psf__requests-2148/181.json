Specifically, in the 'HTTPConnectionPool' class within 'connectionpool.py' and the 'HTTPAdapter' class within 'adapters.py', there are places where SocketError exceptions are being handled, but they are not consistently wrapped into a 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError'. This suggests that these sections of the code are likely where improvements should be made to catch 'socket.error' and raise 'requests.exceptions.ConnectionError' instead. Therefore, considering these findings, I believe the file context provided is appropriate for addressing the issue.",
