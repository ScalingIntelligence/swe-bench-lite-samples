To address this, we need to find places in the code where socket errors are being handled or where requests are being made. Given the stack trace and the focus on the requests library, I'll search relevant files within the requests package and its dependencies, specifically looking for instances where the ConnectionError from requests.exceptions is relevant or where socket errors might arise, and where such errors should ideally be handled or wrapped.",
