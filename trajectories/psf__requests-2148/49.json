This suggests that the error handling mechanism in the requests library might not be properly wrapping socket errors. To address this, we should investigate the exception handling in the relevant parts of the requests library, particularly where socket errors might be encountered.

This suggests a need to catch socket.error and re-raise it as requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Analyzing the provided search results, several key areas are pertinent to addressing this issue: 1. The definition of ConnectionError in 'requests/exceptions.py' indicates the class we need to use for wrapping. 2. The 'Response.iter_content' method in 'requests/models.py' is a critical function where content is streamed from the server, and it already contains exception handling which can be expanded to include socket errors. 3. The 'HTTPResponse.stream' and 'HTTPResponse.read' methods in 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' are also involved in reading data from the response, making them potential points of intervention. 4. 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request' in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' is another crucial section as it handles the actual HTTP request making process where socket errors could occur. Given these findings, the initial focus should be on updating the mentioned methods to catch socket errors and re-raise them using the ConnectionError class.",
