Specifically, the code spans within the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' files are highly relevant, as they contain methods handling HTTP connections, including catching and raising various exceptions, such as SocketError and TimeoutError. The 'HTTPConnectionPool._make_request' method and the 'HTTPConnection.connect' method are particularly noteworthy, as they deal directly with the process of making HTTP requests and connecting to the server, where socket errors could occur. Additionally, the 'WrappedSocket.recv' method in 'requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py' is also relevant, as it handles receiving data where SSL/TLS layer errors (including those that might originate from socket errors) are caught and handled.",

This suggests that a comprehensive enough handling mechanism exists within `urllib3` to manage socket errors.
