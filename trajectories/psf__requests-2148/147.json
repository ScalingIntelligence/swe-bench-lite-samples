This error is specifically mentioned in the user's traceback when a connection is reset, thus being exposed directly to the user rather than being wrapped in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Upon analyzing the search results, it is evident that the relevant sections lie within the `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` file, particularly where socket operations are involved during the HTTP connection process. Span IDs related to `_make_request` and `_get_conn` are of high relevance as they are key in handling the connection establishment and request procession phases, during which `socket.error` might occur. Additionally, the `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method is crucial as it is a central API for connection management and error mitigation. For the `requests/adapters.py` file, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method is relevant due to its direct interaction with the connection via the `HTTPAdapter`. Consequently, the identified spans provide a thorough understanding of the error handling processes within the `requests` library, allowing for the implementation of enhanced exception wrapping for `socket.error`.",
