From the provided search results, several key areas are identified that are relevant to handling connection errors in the requests library, particularly in the urllib3 package. These areas include handling SocketError, TimeoutError, HTTPException, and BaseSSLError in the HTTPConnectionPool class within urllib3/connectionpool.py, which can lead to loss of connection or broken connections. Also relevant is the HTTPResponse class in urllib3/response.py for reading and streaming data from responses, as a broken connection could occur during these operations. Additionally, the HTTPAdapter class in adapters.py is tasked with managing the transport adapter logic during HTTP requests, making it a potential point of interception for socket errors. Lastly, the PoolManager in urllib3/poolmanager.py and Session in sessions.py are central components for managing network connections and sessions respectively, and thus need to ensure that socket errors are properly handled. Notably, the code span in HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen already handles SocketError and other related exceptions by incrementally retrying the connection, suggesting a place where an enhancement could be made to wrap such errors in a more specific requests exception.",
