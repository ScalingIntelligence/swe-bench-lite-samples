This suggests a need to catch such low-level errors and rethrow them as higher-level requests exceptions. From the search results, it's evident that the 'requests' package defines various exceptions including 'ConnectionError' under 'requests/exceptions.py'. This is the high-level exception that should ideally wrap up the socket error for better handling and consistency across codebases using the 'requests' library. Additionally, examining 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' reveals low-level socket operations where such errors could potentially originate, suggesting this as a prime location for implementing the error wrapping. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' also lists several exception classes, supporting the idea that error handling should be robust and provide appropriate context to the user. Given this context, the identified relevant spans include the specific exception classes such as 'ConnectionError' in 'requests/exceptions.py' and potentially where low-level socket operations occur in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' as these are directly relevant to the logic needed to resolve the reported issue.",

This directly addresses the issue as it provides the context for the expected exception handling within the requests library.\n\nAdditionally, the search results in requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py show implementation details of HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection classes, which contain methods for connecting and handling socket connections. These classes could be the place where the socket.error should be caught and re-raised as a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. The presence of these details in the search results suggests a clear path to address the reported issue by enhancing exception handling within these connection classes.\n\nLastly, requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py contains definitions of other relevant exceptions that might be involved in the error handling chain for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.\n\nOverall, the provided search results are relevant to the issue, as they highlight the necessary pieces of code where the exception handling needs to be improved to properly wrap raw socket errors in a requests exception, such as ConnectionError.",
