The stack trace indicates that the error occurs while processing a response using the `requests` library, specifically in the part where it reads data from the socket. We should investigate the code handling socket errors within the `requests` library to ensure they are properly wrapped and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Given the stack trace and the nature of the issue, the search should focus on files related to `requests` internals, particularly those dealing with response handling, socket communication, and exception management.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about a raw socket error being raised as opposed to a more specific requests exception, such as ConnectionError. The goal is to identify sections in the codebase where this transformation might be missing or where additional exception handling could be added. \n\n1. I analyzed the stack trace provided in the issue to understand where the socket error was originating from. The trace specifically mentioned 'socket.py' and 'gevent/socket.py', indicating that error handling around socket operations would be a key area.\n\n2. I then reviewed the provided search results to find sections where socket errors might be handled, or more relevantly, not handled correctly. I focused on files related to networking and HTTP connections, as these are most likely to contain relevant code.\n\n3. From the search results, I identified several files that directly deal with socket and connection handling: \n   - 'requests/packages/urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py': This file contains the 'WrappedSocket' class which might be handling socket-level operations, particularly relevant due to its 'recv' method used for reading data from a socket.\n   - 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py': This file manages connection pooling with a focus on network errors and connections, making it relevant for error handling.\n   - 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py': Since it deals with HTTP response handling, it might contain code related to reading streams which could error out due to network socket issues.\n   - 'requests/adapters.py': This file is responsible for handling different communication protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, which might need exception handling for better error messaging.\n\n4. After analyzing the provided code spans within these files, I found specific parts in 'connectionpool.py', 'adapters.py', and 'response.py' where the current code either handles exceptions or is involved in network communication, but might lack handling specific to socket errors like 'Errno 104' for connection reset.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans provide a good starting point and are likely to be relevant to the issue. They cover areas where socket errors could occur and a specific error like 'Connection reset by peer' is most relevant to the issue. Thus, these spans should be inspected further for validation and corrective action.",

The provided file context contains several key areas of focus: `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`, `requests/adapters.py`, and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`. In `connectionpool.py`, there's a handling mechanism for `SocketError` and other exceptions, which includes the potential to re-raise them as `ProtocolError` or `ProxyError`. This could be relevant to the issue if there's a missing conversion to a `requests`-specific exception. In `adapters.py`, there's explicit handling of `socket.error` that raises a `ConnectionError`, which is what the issue suggests the correct behavior should be. Lastly, `response.py` shows how `SocketTimeout` is raised as `ReadTimeoutError`, which could provide insights into the broader pattern of wrapping lower-level exceptions. Based on this analysis, it appears that the file context does provide relevant code for addressing the issue, particularly in `adapters.py`.",

The 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file contains a span ('urlopen') where various exceptions, including SocketError, are caught and handled. Similarly, in 'requests/adapters.py', the 'send' method of the HTTPAdapter class catches socket errors and raises ConnectionError. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' file also contains exception handling for SocketTimeout, BaseSSLError, and HTTPException. Additionally, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file defines the custom exceptions used by the library, including ConnectionError.

Similarly, the `HTTPAdapter` class in `requests/adapters.py` also catches `socket.error` and wraps it in a `ConnectionError`. These sections of the code indicate that the library is designed to catch and handle `socket.error`, which aligns with the reported issue's request for better exception handling. Moreover, the `HTTPResponse` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` handles `SocketTimeout` and `BaseSSLError`, which indicates a comprehensive approach to exception handling within the library.
