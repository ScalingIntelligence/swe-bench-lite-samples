To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that either raise or handle such exceptions. In the provided search results, we can find the definition of various exceptions within the 'requests' and 'urllib3' packages, which helps us understand how these exceptions are defined and used. Notably, we found definitions for 'ConnectionError' in both 'requests/exceptions.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py'. These definitions are essential for understanding the structure of exceptions in the library and how they might relate to the 'socket.error' being reported. Additionally, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py' file contains code related to connections, including handling of SSL and sockets, which could be a relevant context for understanding where and how 'socket.error' might occur. Based on these findings, it appears that the relevant code spans are the definitions of 'ConnectionError' and related exceptions, as well as the connection handling code in 'urllib3/connection.py'. These should help in addressing the issue by providing the necessary context to potentially modify or add exception handling around 'socket.error'.",

The traceback provided indicates that a raw socket error is raised, suggesting a lack of wrapping of this exception in a more appropriate requests exception like ConnectionError. From the provided file context, we see that RequestException and ConnectionError are defined in requests/exceptions.py, inheriting from IOError which would be an appropriate exception type for wrapping socket errors. However, we need to identify where and if this wrapping is being done in the actual HTTP request/response handling code. The search results contain several relevant files: requests/models.py and requests/packages/urllib3/response.py. In requests/models.py, we find the class Response and its method content which deals with reading the content of a response. This method might be the place where socket errors could arise, but there's no specific exception handling seen in the spans provided. In requests/packages/urllib3/response.py, the HTTPResponse class and its methods deal with lower-level HTTP response handling where socket and connection errors could potentially be caught. The read method in HTTPResponse could be a candidate for catching and wrapping such errors, as it interacts closely with network data. From the provided spans, no direct handling or wrapping of socket.error is identified in the search results directly within methods like read, but these methods could be places to investigate and add such handling. The identified spans suggest sections of code where a developer might add logic to catch socket errors and re-raise them as ConnectionErrors for better consistency and error reporting in the requests library.",

I need to identify relevant code spans that deal with error handling and specifically look for instances where socket.error might be encountered. From the provided context, I already have spans that define the ConnectionError exception and other relevant exceptions in `requests/exceptions.py`. In `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, there are spans that deal with reading data from a socket and decoding content, which could potentially raise socket.error. Looking at the new search results in `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, there are several spans related to HTTP response handling and error management. Specifically, the `read` method in the HTTPResponse class handles reading from the socket and catches various exceptions including `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `HTTPException`. This method appears to be the most relevant to the reported issue, as it directly interacts with the socket and handles potential errors.",

Instead, it is caught and re-raised as a `ProtocolError` if it occurs during reading from the socket. This indicates that while the error is being managed, it is not converted into the expected `ConnectionError` type from the `requests` library. Given this, it appears that an opportunity exists to integrate a more specific error handling mechanism within the `requests` library, aligning more closely with the expectations set by its API.",
