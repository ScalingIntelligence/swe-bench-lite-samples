This suggests a gap in exception handling within the requests library or its dependencies, particularly where socket errors are being handled or propagated. To identify the location of this gap, I will focus on the requests library's files, especially those related to connection handling and exception wrapping. Specifically, I will search for occurrences of 'socket.error' to pinpoint where the raw error is being raised or propagated without proper wrapping.",

To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans where `socket.error` might be handled or raised within the `requests` library. The search results provided include various exception classes and handling mechanisms within the `requests` and `urllib3` packages. The identified classes such as `RequestException`, `HTTPError`, `ConnectionError`, and others in `requests/exceptions.py` are highly relevant as they define the exceptions that should ideally wrap lower-level errors including `socket.error`. Additionally, the `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` file, which contains the `VerifiedHTTPSConnection` class and its `connect` method, is crucial as it involves socket operations that might raise `socket.error`. Handling or raising `ConnectionError` in these contexts would align with the expected behavior noted in the issue. The `urllib3/exceptions.py` file also defines several exceptions that could be used to wrap `socket.error`, such as `ProtocolError` and its subclass `ConnectionError`. These findings suggest that the relevant code spans involve the definition and potential usage of `ConnectionError` to handle lower-level errors, including `socket.error`.",
