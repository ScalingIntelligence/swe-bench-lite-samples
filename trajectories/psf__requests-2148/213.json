These spans include definitions of 'ConnectionError' and its handling in 'requests/adapters.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py'. The 'HTTPAdapter.send' method in 'requests/adapters.py' explicitly catches 'socket.error' and raises a 'ConnectionError', which aligns with the reported issue's request for such wrapping. Similarly, in 'connectionpool.py', various exceptions, including 'SocketError', are caught, and 'ConnectionError' is raised. These sections of code are directly relevant as they demonstrate the exception handling around network errors and how they map to 'requests' custom exceptions.
