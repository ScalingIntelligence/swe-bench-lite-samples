This suggests that the error handling during network operations in the requests library may not be comprehensive enough. The provided file context and search results primarily focus on the connection management in the urllib3 package, which is used by requests for handling HTTP connections. The search results include several key functions in the HTTPConnectionPool class, such as _get_conn, _put_conn, and _make_request, which deal with acquiring and releasing connections and making HTTP requests. These functions are relevant because they handle the actual socket operations and would therefore be the primary locations for adding or enhancing error handling, such as catching socket.error and re-raising it as a more specific requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Specifically, the _make_request method contains try-except blocks that catch various types of exceptions, including SocketTimeout and SocketError, but does not explicitly catch or wrap socket.error, which aligns with the reported issue. This method is particularly relevant for consideration in addressing the issue, as it directly involves the HTTP request process where network or socket errors are most likely to occur.",
