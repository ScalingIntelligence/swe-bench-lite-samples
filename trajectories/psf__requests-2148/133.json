Similarly, in urllib3/connection.py, the HTTPSConnection class deals with connection handling but does not show explicit error handling for socket.error.

The code snippet provided in this class shows various ways the HTTP response could be handled, including handling for `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `HTTPException`. However, there doesn't appear to be a specific catch for `socket.error`. Therefore, a logical next step would be to expand the search to include parts of the library explicitly handling socket errors and mapping them onto `ConnectionError` or other HTTP exception types in a similar manner to how Timeout and SSL errors are handled. Additionally, other parts of the connection handling in `requests/packages/urllib3/connection.py` might also need investigation to ensure that all socket errors are appropriately handled and wrapped to fit the expected context of using the requests library.",

The code snippet provided in this class shows various ways the HTTP response could be handled, including handling for `SocketTimeout`, `BaseSSLError`, and `HTTPException`. However, there doesn't appear to be a specific catch for `socket.error`. Therefore, a logical next step would be to expand the search to include parts of the library explicitly handling socket errors and mapping them onto `ConnectionError` or other HTTP exception types in a similar manner to how Timeout and SSL errors are handled.
