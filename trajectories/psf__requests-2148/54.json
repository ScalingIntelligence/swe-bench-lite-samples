This suggests that the error handling in the requests package might not be wrapping all socket errors as expected. The provided stack trace points to the relevant sections of code where the error occurred, particularly in the `requests/models.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`, and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` files. To address this issue, it is important to look into how socket errors are handled and ensure they are appropriately wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Considering the specific files and functions involved in the stack trace, we can narrow down our search to these areas.",

These files define exception classes like `ConnectionError`, `ReadTimeoutError`, and methods that manage HTTP connections and response handling. The stack trace provided in the issue suggests that errors propagate from socket operations as raw socket errors, missing an opportunity to convert them into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
