This should help in managing the errors more effectively within a codebase that uses the 'requests' library extensively. \n\nThe relevant sections of the 'requests' library where such error handling should occur include the definition of exceptions in 'requests/exceptions.py' and the handling of connection errors in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py'. Specifically, the 'ConnectionError' class in 'requests/exceptions.py' should be the parent class for such errors, and within 'connectionpool.py', there are methods like 'urlopen' where errors like 'SocketError' are caught and should handle them by raising a 'ConnectionError'. \n\nThe provided search results align with this expectation by showing the definitions of various exception classes including 'ConnectionError', and the 'urlopen' method in 'HTTPConnectionPool' which is responsible for managing connections and handling related errors. These identified spans are crucial for understanding how 'socket.error' can be properly caught and wrapped into a 'ConnectionError'. \n\nBased on the analysis, the task is not yet complete as there is no specific identification of code where the 'socket.error' would be caught and transformed into 'ConnectionError'. The next steps could involve a more detailed search or modification in the 'urlopen' method or related parts of the codebase where raw errors like 'socket.error' should be explicitly handled and raised as 'ConnectionError'.'",
