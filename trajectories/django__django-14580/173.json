The issue is traced back to the Django module django.db.migrations.writer. By examining the search results and current context, it is clear that the relevant code is located within the `MigrationWriter` class in the `writer.py` file. The `MigrationWriter.as_string` method plays a crucial role in generating the migration file's content. The analysis of this method reveals that it constructs the migration file's content, including the imports section. The method checks for existing imports and adds necessary imports such as 'from django.db import migrations'. However, it discards 'from django.db import models' if it exists, instead of combining it with 'migrations'. This suggests an oversight that could cause the mentioned error. It is crucial to note that this method is responsible for determining which imports to include and which to exclude, which directly affects the completeness and correctness of the generated migration file. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those that handle the import statements in the `as_string` method, specifically the logic that deals with discarding or adding 'models' to the import list.",

These classes are crucial for generating migration files and include methods for serializing operations and managing imports. The relevant code spans include the import statement handling in MigrationWriter.as_string, which currently checks for the 'models' import but does not ensure it is added if missing. Additionally, the OperationWriter.serialize method is responsible for writing operation strings, which may also indirectly influence the import handling.
