This error occurs when the migration file is generated without including the necessary 'from django.db import models' statement. The search results provided include the relevant part of the Django codebase responsible for writing migration files. The main focus should be on the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method, which constructs the migration file. The method currently checks for an existing import of 'from django.db import models' and adjusts it accordingly, but the 'models' import is not being correctly preserved or added if it's missing. This indicates that the issue lies in how the imports are being managed and serialized within the 'MigrationWriter' class. To fix the issue, the relevant spans of code to focus on are those handling the import statements within the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method.",

The file context provided shows the implementation of the MigrationWriter class in Django, which is responsible for generating migration files. Upon examining the 'as_string' method, it's clear that the current logic for handling imports in the MigrationWriter ensures that 'from django.db import migrations' is always included, but does not consistently ensure the inclusion of 'models' when necessary. This explains the issue reported, where 'models' is needed but not imported. To resolve this, the process of collecting imports needs to be updated to ensure 'models' is included whenever there are references to model fields or other model-related operations. Given the context, the relevant part of the codebase (MigrationWriter) has been identified, indicating the area where a fix might be applied to include the 'models' import appropriately.",
