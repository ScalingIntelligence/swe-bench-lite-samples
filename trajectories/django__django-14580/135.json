The search results show portions of the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which is where the migration file is generated. The `MigrationWriter` class is responsible for the actual generation of the migration file string. In the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method, we can see a part of the code that processes and includes necessary imports for the migration file. There is logic to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is added to the imports. However, it looks like this logic might not be working correctly, as the reported issue indicates that the import is missing in the actual generated migration file. This suggests that the bug might be related to how imports are being processed and added in the `as_string` method. Since the issue already focuses on the `MigrationWriter` class and the `as_string` method, and the search results include the relevant parts of the class that handle imports and generation of the migration file, we can focus on identifying specific spans within this method that might be causing the issue or are relevant for a fix.",
