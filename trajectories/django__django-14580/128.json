This error occurs because the migration file generated by Django's migration writer does not include the necessary import statement for 'models'. The key element to focus on in the search results is the handling of imports and the generation of the migration file itself. \n\nIn the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes are critical as they are responsible for generating the migration files. Specifically, the 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class constructs the migration file content, including the necessary imports. The current code adds an import for 'migrations' but does not explicitly ensure that 'models' is imported when required. This is likely the root cause of the issue as the migration file lacks the required 'from django.db import models' statement. \n\nThe 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method includes a section where it checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and, if so, it modifies the import to include 'migrations' as well. However, it does not add the 'models' import if it is not already present, which leads to the reported issue. The relevant code spans are those that handle the imports within the 'as_string' method. \n\nThe 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' file contains serializers for various types of objects, but it does not directly impact the generation of the import statements in the migration file. It is, however, a useful reference to understand how different types of objects are serialized, which might indirectly influence the generation of migration files. \n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those in the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method where the imports are constructed and managed. This method should be modified to ensure that when 'models' is needed in the migration file, it is explicitly imported. This would resolve the NameError and generate a valid Python migration file.",

The 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file is particularly important as it contains the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes, which are directly involved in writing migration files. The method 'MigrationWriter.as_string' and 'OperationWriter.serialize' are central to the process of serializing and writing operations to the migration file. The code spans in these classes should be closely examined for any logic errors or omissions that could lead to missing import statements. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file is relevant as it contains operations related to model changes, which are components of migrations. It is crucial to ensure that all necessary import statements are included when operations are serialized.

The search results provide additional context about the migration writing process in Django. Specifically, the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' handle the serialization of migrations and operations, which includes managing imports. The code spans within these classes show how imports are managed and serialized, but do not specifically address the missing 'models' import. However, the 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is responsible for creating models in migrations and uses the 'models' import directly. This suggests that the issue might be related to how imports are handled or serialized in the 'MigrationWriter' class. The provided search results do not cover all sections of the relevant files, particularly the parts where the actual serialization and writing of the migration files occur. To fully resolve the issue, it's necessary to inspect the complete logic in 'MigrationWriter' and how it processes and writes imports, especially how it might exclude or forget to include 'from django.db import models' in certain scenarios. Additionally, reviewing the 'serializer.py' file to ensure that model-related imports are correctly managed during the serialization process could be beneficial. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint whether the issue lies within the handling of imports or in the logic of generating the migration file content.",
