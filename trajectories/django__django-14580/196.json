The error points to the 'models' module not being defined in the migration file. Based on the provided context, it's likely related to how Django's migration writer module handles imports. I will focus my search on the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module, specifically looking into the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods such as 'serialize' and 'register_serializer'. Also, I will check the 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' module as it directly involves model operations in migrations.",

In the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the class 'MigrationWriter' and its method 'as_string' are responsible for generating the migration file. The method 'as_string' does handle imports but does not explicitly ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included. The other file, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', defines the 'CreateModel' operation, which is central to the reported issue since it's the operation that causes the missing import problem. The 'CreateModel' operation is processed by 'OperationWriter', which uses 'MigrationWriter.serialize' to handle the serialization of each operation, including the 'CreateModel' operation.",

The provided context shows code spans from the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' files. The relevant code spans are those that handle the generation of the migration file and the operations within it. The new search results don't reveal new spans directly related to the handling the 'models' import issue during the migration file generation, but they give insights into where and how the migration file is structured and how imports are consolidated. The span 'MigrationWriter.as_string' - creating the migration file - adds importance as it likely holds the logic to determine which imports should go into the final migration file. 'MigrationWriter.serialize' is of apparent interest also as it appears to provide methods to serialize the migration elements. The expected addition probably needs a new condition within the as_string method or serialize method so that it can add from django.db import models when creating a migration string.  In conclusion, the search results complete a more detailed mapping from the Django codebase aiming to identify the very sections that might operate relevant serializations or importing controls within the migrations file generation process. But more context-matched specific solutions are required to fulfill the 'missing import statement' issue's exactness.",
