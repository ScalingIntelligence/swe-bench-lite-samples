This leads to a 'NameError' when attempting to use 'models' in the migration. The relevant sections in the search results are primarily the imports sections where 'models' should be explicitly imported. \n\n### Analysis of Search Results:\n- **django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py**: This file contains imports related to migration operations, but it does not handle the generation of the migration files themselves.\n- **django/db/migrations/__init__.py**: This file imports 'Migration' and operations related to migrations, but it does not specifically deal with the content of the generated migration files.\n- **django/db/migrations/state.py**: This file handles the state of models during migrations and imports 'models' from 'django.db', which is relevant but does not directly affect the import statement in the generated migration files.\n- **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py**: This file contains operations related to models in migrations and imports 'models' from 'django.db'. This is relevant because it indicates where model operations are defined and used in migrations.\n- **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py**: This file detects changes in models for migrations and imports 'models' from 'django.db'. This is relevant as it processes model changes that lead to migration files.\n- **django/db/migrations/writer.py**: This is the most relevant file as it handles the writing of migration files. The 'OperationWriter' class serializes operations into the migration files. The absence of a specific import statement for 'models' in the generated migration files could be related to how this serialization process is handled.\n\n### Relevance and Completeness:\nThe most relevant file is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' as it directly deals with writing the migration files. The 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method are crucial for determining how operations are written into the migration files. If the import statement for 'models' is omitted here, it could explain the 'NameError' described in the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans focus on the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, specifically the 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method, which are the most directly related to the reported issue.",

Given the context file, it's evident that the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module is responsible for writing migration files. However, the file context does not explicitly show an import statement for 'models' within the part of code that generates the migration file. Based on the issue's description and the provided file context, the relevant code that is supposed to handle imports in the generated migration file is present, but it does not explicitly address the missing 'models' import that causes the NameError. This suggests that while the module for generating migrations is correctly identified, the specific line or logic that ensures all necessary imports are included might be missing or insufficient.",

The '_write' method is central to this process, as it manages the serialization and incorporation of each argument. However, the current implementation does not explicitly ensure the inclusion of necessary imports like 'models' from 'django.db'. Additionally, the 'serialize' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class or an equivalent could be the focal point for ensuring that critical imports are not omitted. As part of a potential solution, enhancing the serialization process to include mandatory imports might resolve the issue without the need for further exploration of individual operation writer methods.",

This results in a NameError when the 'models' module is referenced in the generated migration. The provided search results focus on the Django migration writer and serializer modules. It is crucial to identify the part of the code responsible for writing the migration file to ensure that the 'from django.db import models' statement is included. The relevant sections from the search results include 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' where the 'MigrationWriter' class methods 'as_string' and 'serialize' are located. These methods handle the serialization of the migration operations and the generation of the migration file. By examining these sections, it is evident that the 'MigrationWriter' class does not explicitly ensure the inclusion of the 'models' import in the generated migration file. This oversight likely causes the reported issue. The current context highlights this shortcoming in the 'MigrationWriter' class, which needs to be addressed to ensure all necessary imports are included in the migration file.",
