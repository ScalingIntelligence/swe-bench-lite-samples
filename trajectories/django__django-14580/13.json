This suggests that the migration file's header might be missing the necessary import statement 'from django.db import models'. Given the context and the provided files, it seems relevant to focus on the django.db.migrations.writer module where the MigrationWriter class is defined, as this class likely plays a role in generating the migration files. It's also relevant to look at the django.db.migrations.operations.models module where model operations are defined, especially the CreateModel class, as this is where the model creation operation could be influenced.",

In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'OperationWriter' class and the 'MigrationWriter' class are responsible for generating the migration files. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method and the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method are particularly relevant, as they handle the serialization and generation of the migration file content. These methods do not explicitly include the 'from django.db import models' import, which could explain the missing import statement observed in the generated migration file. Additionally, in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is relevant as it is used to define the creation of models within migrations. The 'CreateModel.__init__' method and the 'CreateModel.serialization_expand_args' attribute are particularly relevant, as they involve the fields and options that would be included in the generated migration. These pieces of code help in understanding how model creation is handled in migrations and can help identify any missing imports or potential issues with serialization.
