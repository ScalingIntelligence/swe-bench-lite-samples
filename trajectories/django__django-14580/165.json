The search results provided reveal the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, which houses the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods responsible for generating migration files. The code spans within this file, particular those within the 'MigrationWriter' class, are reviewed to identify any missing imports or areas where the 'models' module should be included. The 'as_string' method in 'MigrationWriter' gathers all necessary imports, including those for operations and dependencies. Notably, 'OperationWriter' handles the serialization of individual operations. Despite the presence of code handling imports in 'MigrationWriter', it lacks a direct import for the 'models' module, which could be causing the issue.

The initial analysis of the file context and search results revealed that in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the imports are handled dynamically and there's a specific handling for 'models'. However, the logic to ensure 'from django.db import models' is added seems to be missing. Further, in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', there's detailed handling of model operations but no specific correction for the missing import. The 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' also contains the 'OperationWriter' class which serializes operations and handles imports, but again, lacks specific handling for ensuring the 'models' import. The search results confirm that the code indeed lacks a direct handling of ensuring the 'models' import in migrations, suggesting a potential bug in the module handling migration writing in Django.",

Upon reviewing the `as_string` method in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, it's evident that the import for 'models' is conditionally included based on the operations and dependencies present in the migration. The method dynamically constructs import statements and omits 'models' if it's not needed directly by the operations or dependencies. Given this, it is plausible that the migration does not add the 'models' import if it's not deemed necessary by the specific operations included in the migration. The provided file context includes the relevant logic in the `as_string` method within the `MigrationWriter` class and the `OperationWriter` class, which are responsible for generating the migration file and its contents.

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
