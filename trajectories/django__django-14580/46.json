The issue occurs when the migration file tries to use 'models' from django.db without importing it, leading to a NameError. To address this, we need to identify the part of the codebase responsible for generating this migration file and ensure that it includes the necessary import statement for 'models'. Given the context and the search results, the relevant code spans are found in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. This file contains the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes, which are responsible for serializing and writing the migration files. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method specifically deals with the serialization of operations, and it's the place where the import statements for the operation are determined and added. Adding an import statement for 'models' in this section could potentially resolve the issue. Therefore, the identified code spans include the 'serialize' method and the parts of the 'MigrationWriter' class that handle imports and the generation of the migration file.",
