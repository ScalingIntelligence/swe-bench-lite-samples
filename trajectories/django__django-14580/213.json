From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are within the 'MigrationWriter' class in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file. The spans that are particularly relevant are those dealing with the generation of the migration file and the handling of imports. The 'as_string' method in particular is responsible for constructing the migration file content and managing the imports. The logic in 'as_string' initially includes an import for 'models' when migrating models, but in this scenario, it seems to be missing. This suggests that the logic for including 'models' in the imports might have an issue or might be bypassed under certain conditions, leading to the reported error.

This class is responsible for generating the migration files and includes methods to handle imports and operations within the migrations. The specific issue reported is that 'models' is not being imported correctly in the generated migration file, which leads to a NameError. Examining the code, it appears that there is a logic to handle specific imports, including 'models'. However, the logic to add 'models' to the imports set seems to be conditional on whether 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports set. If it is not present, only 'from django.db import migrations' is added, which might be the source of the issue. Additionally, there is a comment within the code about manually copying functions from certain migrations, which could be a clue about the need to manually ensure certain imports are handled correctly. Overall, the code in the file context provides insight into how migration imports are managed, but the specific issue of missing 'models' import seems related to the logic within the as_string method.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
