This logic suggests that the import for 'models' should be automatically added to the generated migration files. However, the error indicates that this import is missing in certain cases. To address this, a detailed examination of the logic within the 'OperationWriter' class and how it handles the serialization of operations like 'CreateModel' is necessary.
