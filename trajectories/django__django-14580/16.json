The error occurs in the migration file generated by Django's makemigrations command. The relevant code segments provided suggest that the issue is likely within the django.db.migrations module, specifically in the writer.py file where the MigrationWriter class is defined. The MigrationWriter class is responsible for writing migration files, so it's plausible that the error handling or the logic for including necessary imports is failing. We will focus our search on the django.db.migrations module, specifically looking into the MigrationWriter class and its methods to find where the import statement might be missing.",

These classes and their methods are potential places to look for a fix or a potential cause of the issue, particularly the 'serialize' method in OperationWriter and various parts of MigrationWriter related to generating migration files.

This issue occurs because the migration file generated by Django's 'makemigrations' command is missing an import statement for 'from django.db import models'. From the search results, the relevant code spans can be found in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. In particular, the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method and the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method handle the serialization of migration operations and the overall generation of the migration file respectively. These methods need to ensure that the import statement 'from django.db import models' is included, which currently seems to be missing or not handled correctly in the logic of these methods. The span 'MigrationWriter.as_string' is critical as it assembles the final migration script and needs to include the necessary import statements. Additionally, the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method, which deals with individual operations, should also ensure that the imports required for each operation are correctly managed and included in the final migration script.",

The 'as_string' method of 'MigrationWriter' is where the imports are sorted and added to the migration file, but it seems to handle imports for 'migrations' but does not explicitly add 'from django.db import models' if it's not already in the imports set. This could explain the missing import statement for 'models'. Additionally, the 'OperationWriter' class, also in 'writer.py', might not be handling the 'models' import correctly when serializing operations. Given this context, a closer inspection of these classes, especially around import handling in 'MigrationWriter.as_string' and 'OperationWriter.serialize', is warranted to understand if 'models' should be explicitly imported under certain conditions.",
