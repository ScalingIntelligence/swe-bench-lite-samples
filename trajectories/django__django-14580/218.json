The spans labeled 'imports' contain the necessary import statements for 'models', which are critical for resolving the NameError.

These methods interact with 'models', reinforcing their relevance to the issue at hand. While the search results do not directly point to the specific area of the codebase responsible for generating the migration files, the imports and the handling of model operations are likely areas to investigate further to resolve the missing import issue.

The new search results present sections of `django/db/migrations/writer.py` that handle the serialization and writing of migration files. Specifically, the `as_string` method of `MigrationWriter` is responsible for generating the content of the migration file. This method collects imports and operations for the migration. The method does handle imports, but the logic regarding 'models' is not explicitly clear, especially why 'models' might not be getting added in certain scenarios. Given the issue's nature, examining the `as_string` method in detail is crucial to understand how imports are managed and potentially identify why the 'models' import might be omitted. The code snippet where imports are processed and added to the migration file content will be particularly relevant for this analysis. By carefully reviewing this section, we can understand if there is a specific condition or omission that could lead to the 'models' import not being included in the final migration file, thus potentially resolving the reported issue.",
