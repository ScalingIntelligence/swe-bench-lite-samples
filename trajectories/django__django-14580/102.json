This suggests that the issue lies within the migration generation process. The code spans provided include relevant parts of the Django migration framework, specifically in the MigrationWriter class within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. Notably, the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method is responsible for generating the migration file content and already includes logic to manage imports. However, the logic for handling imports does not consistently ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included whenever 'models' is referenced within the migration operations. This omission seems to be the root cause of the reported issue. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file contains the CreateModel class, which is used to define operations for creating models in migrations, and imports 'from django.db import models'. This further supports that the 'models' import should be consistently handled in the migration generation process to avoid such errors.",

This issue results in a 'NameError' when the migration file is executed. The current file context includes several relevant files and spans, primarily within the django/db/migrations/writer.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. In the search results, there's a continuation of the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file with important sections such as the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method is relevant because it constructs the migration file's content, including handling imports. The method doesn't directly address the issue of ensuring the 'models' import is included, but it's the central place where migration file content is composed. This suggests that the solution might involve adjusting the import handling logic within this method. Additionally, the 'MigrationWriter.__init__' method initializes the class instance, which is foundational for understanding the context in which the migration file is written. Given these details, the identified spans in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' are relevant and should be included for further analysis and potential code changes to fix the missing import issue.",
