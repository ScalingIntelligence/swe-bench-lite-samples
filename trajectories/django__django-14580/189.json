The search results provide context in two files: django/db/migrations/writer.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. The former file contains the MigrationWriter class responsible for generating migration files. The method MigrationWriter.as_string is of particular interest as it constructs the migration file's content, handling imports and operations. This method initially adds the necessary imports and constructs the migration file content accordingly. The current logic correctly adds 'from django.db import migrations' if 'models' is not already included. However, it doesn't explicitly add 'from django.db import models' unless it is already in the imports, which might explain the reported issue. The second file, models.py, defines operations related to model changes, and although it uses 'from django.db import models', it does not directly address the issue of generating the migration file. Therefore, focusing on the MigrationWriter.as_string method in writer.py is crucial to fix the reported issue. Ensuring 'from django.db import models' is always included when generating a migration file seems to be the key solution.",
