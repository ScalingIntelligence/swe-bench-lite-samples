The error 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' occurs when the migration file is missing an import statement for 'models'. This suggests a potential issue within the module django.db.migrations.writer, as this module is responsible for writing migrations. To debug this, we need to focus on the MigrationWriter class and its methods, particularly those involved in serialization and writing the migration files. Additionally, it would be prudent to check the related OperationWriter class which may also contribute to this issue. Given the context provided, the search should focus on these specific classes and their methods within the django.db.migrations module.",

This causes a NameError when the migration file is executed. Upon examining the search results, it's evident that the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is responsible for writing the migration files. The OperationWriter and MigrationWriter classes in this file handle the serialization of operations and the migration itself. However, the current implementation does not explicitly ensure the import of 'models' in the generated migration files. The relevant code spans are those dealing with the serialization and rendering of the migration file, particularly where imports are managed and written into the migration file. This involves the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, which determines the imports needed for the migration and adds them to the migration file. The method logic should be reviewed to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included when necessary, which is currently missing as per the issue description. The issue could potentially be fixed by updating the logic in 'MigrationWriter.as_string' to always ensure the 'models' import is included when not already present, especially when the migration involves operations that reference 'models' such as 'CreateModel'. The identified code spans provide the context necessary to understand and fix the issue within the Django migrations module.",
