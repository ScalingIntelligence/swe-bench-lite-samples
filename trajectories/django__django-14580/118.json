This leads to a NameError when the migration file is executed. The search results provided include two files: django/db/migrations/writer.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. Both files are relevant because they deal with the generation and handling of migration operations. The django/db/migrations/writer.py file contains the MigrationWriter class which is responsible for writing the migration files. The as_string method in this class sets up the imports for the migration file. However, the handling of the 'models' import seems to be incorrect, as it checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and then discards it or adds 'from django.db import migrations' without the 'models' module. This likely leads to the missing import statement in the generated migration file. The django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file contains the CreateModel class which is used to create models in migrations. Although this file itself does not directly cause the missing import issue, it is still relevant context for understanding how model operations are handled in migrations. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those in the as_string method of the MigrationWriter class, particularly the handling of imports.

The logic for determining which imports to include in the migration file is found within the as_string method of the MigrationWriter class. This method constructs the migration file's content, including the necessary imports for operations defined in the migration's operations list. The error in question, 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined', suggests that an important import might be omitted under certain conditions. After reviewing the code, it appears that the line 'from django.db import models' is explicitly removed from the imports set and replaced with 'from django.db import migrations, models' if it already exists. If not, it defaults to 'from django.db import migrations'. This logic might be causing the import to be missing in certain conditions, potentially when 'models' is needed but not explicitly added back to the imports set. Further investigation into this logic and how operations that require the 'models' import are serialized might reveal the underlying issue.",
