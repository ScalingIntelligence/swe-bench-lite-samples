Here are my steps and thoughts:\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The issue involves a NameError because 'models' is not defined in the generated migration file. This suggests that the import statement 'from django.db import models' is missing in the migration script.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Code**: The search results and file context provided point to the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', which contains the class 'MigrationWriter'. This class is responsible for generating the content of the migration file.\n\n3. **Examining the 'as_string' Method**: Within the 'MigrationWriter' class, there is an 'as_string' method that constructs the migration file content. There is a section that handles imports and includes 'from django.db import migrations'. The issue suggests that this section may not include 'models', which could cause the error.\n\n4. **Reviewing the Imported Code**: The imported code discusses how to handle and manage imports but doesn't explicitly demonstrate adding 'from django.db import models, migrations' when 'models' is used in the generated migration file.\n\n5. **Evaluating Missing Imports**: The code in question checks for existing imports, and if 'from django.db import models' exists, it adjusts it properly by adding 'migrations'. However, if the code that uses 'models' is not directly invoking 'from django.db import models', it would not include it in the imports.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans need to be identified to confirm that the migration writer correctly considers and incorporates 'models' into the imports when needed to prevent the error. This involves evaluating the logic in 'as_string' and on handling imports, whether in OperationWriter's or MigrationWriter's approach.",
