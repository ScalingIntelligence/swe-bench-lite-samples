The logic around imports seems to handle various cases but looks like it might miss adding the 'models' import under certain conditions when 'CreateModel' operations are involved. Specifically, if 'from django.db import models' is already in the 'imports' set, it ensures 'models' is referenced from 'django.db' but does not do this check in all cases. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' operation itself does not explicitly manage imports, relying on the broader logic in 'MigrationWriter' for this task.

There's a specific logic block that checks for 'from django.db import models' and adjusts the imports accordingly. However, this block does not seem to address the case where 'models' is not initially in the imports set, which might lead to the 'models' being used in the operation without the necessary import. The 'CreateModel' operation, found in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', does not directly manage imports but uses 'models' in its implementation, relying on the 'MigrationWriter' to handle essential imports.
