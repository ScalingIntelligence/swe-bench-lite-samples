Given the context provided, the problem likely resides in the migration writing process within Django. The initial code provided in the models.py file shows a custom field and model definition. The migration file generated by the makemigrations command is missing an import statement for 'models'. This issue might be rooted in the django.db.migrations.writer module specifically in the MigrationWriter or OperationWriter classes. The search should focus on these classes in the django.db.migrations.writer module to identify where the import statement might be missing or not properly handled during the migration file generation process.",

The issue could be related to the interaction between the migration operations and the state of the models during the migration generation process. Therefore, expanding the search to include the django.db.migrations.state module could be beneficial, as it deals with the state of the models and their representation during migrations. Additionally, considering the context of the error and the specific line where it occurs in the generated migration file, a direct search for that line in the broader django.db context might reveal more about the conditions or code paths that lead to the missing import statement.",
