Based on the provided context, the file that likely needs to be investigated is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' as it contains classes related to writing the migration file. Additionally, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' might also be relevant as it deals with model-specific operations in migrations. The search should focus on these files to identify if there's a missing import statement for 'models' during the migration generation process.",

The search results include two main files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. The 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file contains the classes 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter', which are responsible for serializing and generating the migration files. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method is particularly relevant as it handles the serialization of operations into the migration file's content. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method also processes the imports and constructs the migration file. These methods do handle imports but do not explicitly handle the 'models' import case, which is likely causing the issue. The second file 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' defines operations related to models but is not directly relevant to the import issue in the migration file generation. Based on this analysis, the critical spans in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file that need attention are the 'OperationWriter.serialize' and 'MigrationWriter.as_string' methods.

However, it only adds 'from django.db import migrations' if 'from django.db import models' is not found. This suggests that there might be a scenario where 'models' is needed but not explicitly imported. To mitigate this, deeper investigation into how each operation is serialized and which of these operations might require the 'models' import is necessary.
