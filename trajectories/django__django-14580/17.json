The error specifically mentions a NameError referencing 'models'. Given the context, it's likely that the module responsible for writing migrations, `django.db.migrations.writer`, might be the location of the bug. Additionally, the `django.db.migrations.operations.models` module is of interest as it involves operations directly related to model changes during migrations. The current file context shows no relevant files found yet, so a focused search in these specific modules should prioritize looking for any missing imports or issues related to generating migration files.",

This import statement is necessary for the code to function correctly. Upon analyzing the search results, the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file seems to be the most relevant as it contains the logic for generating migration files. The 'MigrationWriter' class in this file is responsible for creating the content of a migration file. However, looking at the current 'MigrationWriter' class, it does not explicitly add the 'from django.db import models' import if it's not already included. This seems to be the root cause of the reported issue. The relevant code spans are the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method and parts of the 'MigrationWriter' class where imports are handled. The 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file also contains relevant code, as it defines operations like 'CreateModel', which are used in migration files. These operations might reference the 'models' module, making them also relevant to understand the context. Overall, the search task is not yet complete because while we've identified the likely source of the issue and relevant code spans, we haven't found the exact location or a solution to ensure the 'models' import is always included in generated migrations.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
