The migration file fails because it references `models` without importing it. The relevant part of the Django codebase to investigate is the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which is responsible for generating migration files. In the provided search results, the `MigrationWriter` class in `writer.py` is of particular interest. This class has a method `as_string` that constructs the migration file content, including operations and dependencies. The method does not currently ensure that necessary imports, like `from django.db import models`, are included. This omission could be the cause of the missing import statement in the generated migration file. Other files like `state.py`, `serializer.py`, and `autodetector.py` also interact with migration generation but do not directly handle the creation of the migration file's content. The main focus, therefore, should be on enhancing the `MigrationWriter` class to ensure all necessary imports are included in the generated migration file.",
