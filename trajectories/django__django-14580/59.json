Analyzing the search results, particularly the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', it's clear that the code handling the imports for the migration file is located within the 'as_string' method. This method constructs the string representation of the migration file and manages the imports. The code logic in this method adds the 'from django.db import migrations' import if not already present, but it doesn't specifically ensure that 'models' is included if it is needed by operations. This could be the reason for the missing import issue described. The 'models' import is only added if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports set, otherwise, it is omitted. This confirms that the identified code span is directly related to the issue as it is responsible for generating the migration file with the required imports.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
