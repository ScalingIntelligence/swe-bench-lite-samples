This suggests that the problem might lie within the migration file generation logic, which could involve the django.db.migrations.writer module where MigrationWriter is defined. Additionally, the operations defined in django.db.migrations.operations.models.py, which interact with models directly, might also be relevant. Since the initial context does not contain a specific snippet where the import is missing, a broad search within the migration-related files is necessary to identify where the missing import might be required. Focusing on the writer and operations modules for missing imports or faulty logic is a good starting point.",

The error occurs when the migration file is generated by Django and it references 'models' without importing it. We need to identify the relevant code spans that contribute to this issue, particularly focusing on where the migrations are generated or where the necessary imports are checked and added. From the search results, the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' contains the 'MigrationWriter' class which is responsible for writing the migration files. Key methods here are 'as_string' and 'serialize'. In the 'as_string' method, the imports for the migration are generated and managed, and in the 'serialize' method, serialization of various objects is handled including models and operations, where imports might be missed if not sufficiently handled. The file 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' includes the 'serializer_factory' function which instantiates the appropriate serializer for given objects, but it does not directly handle the importing logic for these objects. Therefore, the main focus should be on modifying the 'write_serialization' or any related methods in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' to ensure that all necessary imports including 'models' are included in the generated migration files.",

This omission could lead to the 'models' module not being defined in the generated migration files, as initially reported. The `MigrationWriter.serialize` method, responsible for serialization and import management, should be evaluated to ensure that it correctly includes all necessary imports, especially for core Django modules like 'models'. Additionally, the operations in `django.db.migrations.operations.models.py` currently appear to correctly import and use the 'models' module.
