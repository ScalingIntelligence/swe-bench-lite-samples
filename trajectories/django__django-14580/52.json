This error occurs in the context of creating a new model in a migration file, specifically in the 'bases' attribute of the CreateModel operation. I analyzed the search results to identify the relevant code spans relating to the generation and writing of migrations. The primary file of interest is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', particularly the 'MigrationWriter' class, which handles the serialization and formatting of migration files. Two key spans from this file are relevant: 'MigrationWriter.as_string', which constructs the migration file content including imports and operations, and 'imports', which directly deals with the management of import statements in the migration file. Although the code in these spans handles imports, it does not explicitly ensure that the 'models' import is added in every case, which could explain the missing import issue reported. In 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is also relevant as it deals with the creation of model operations in migrations. However, none of the spans directly address the missing import issue, although they indicate how model operations are structured in migrations. The identified spans in 'MigrationWriter' from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the missing import issue, but further analysis or code adjustments in these areas may be needed to address the specific NameError.",

It includes the logic for handling imports and assembling the migration file. Part of the issue involves the missing 'models' import in the generated migration, which leads to a NameError. There is code in the 'MigrationWriter' class that adds 'from django.db import migrations' to imports and adjusts for existing 'models' imports, but it does not currently account for absent 'models' imports in cases when they are required by the operations. To fully resolve this issue, the writer should ensure 'models' is imported when needed, or include a default import along with 'migrations' if not already present. Based on the provided context, it seems that the 'MigrationWriter' class requires additional logic to always include 'models' when necessary, which is not currently implemented.",
