A focused search on the 'MigrationWriter' class within this module and its related methods might reveal the cause of the missing import. Additionally, related files and classes in the 'django.db.migrations' package that handle the creation and serialization of migrations should be checked.",

The search results include files from Django's migration module, specifically 'writer.py', 'recorder.py', and 'migration.py'. Analyzing 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for generating the migration file. The 'as_string' method formulates the migration file's content, including handling imports. Notably, the method already includes logic to manage imports and specifically handles 'from django.db import models'. However, the logic ensures 'from django.db import migrations' is included by default, but it doesn't explicitly force 'models' to be included if not already present through other imports. This might be the missing link that causes the reported issue when 'models' is not explicitly imported when required.\n\nIn 'recorder.py', the 'MigrationRecorder' class includes imports such as 'from django.db import models', which would imply that this file could be a relevant place to ensure 'models' is always imported when needed, but this file is more focused on the recording of migrations rather than the generation of migration content.\n\n'migration.py' doesn't directly handle the import logic but defines the 'Migration' class which represents a migration. This class would be instantiated and manipulated by the 'MigrationWriter' to form the content of the migration file.\n\nBased on this analysis, the issue likely lies within how 'MigrationWriter' handles and ensures necessary imports, particularly 'from django.db import models', when generating migration files.\n\nRelevant spans from 'writer.py' include the 'as_string' method and its handling of imports, as this directly affects how the migration file is generated and what imports it includes.",
