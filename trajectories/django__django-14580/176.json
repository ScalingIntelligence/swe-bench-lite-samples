The Django's `MigrationWriter` class in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` is responsible for generating migration files. In the search results, the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method handles the creation of the migration file's content, including the imports. Interestingly, there is a specific handling related to imports: if 'from django.db import models' is found in the imports, it ensures that 'models' is included in that import statement, otherwise, it adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This suggests that the script might be missing to add the import for 'models' in some scenarios.

The migration file was generated by Django's makemigrations command, which is expected to automatically include necessary imports to make the file valid Python code. I noticed that in the provided context from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', there are spans related to the 'MigrationWriter' class, specifically the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method. This method seems to handle the creation of the migration file contents, including the inclusion of necessary imports. Analyzing the new search results, especially the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, reveals that it indeed manages the imports for the migration file. The relevant portion of this method that deals with imports is attempting to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included if necessary. However, the logic for handling imports has a specific condition where it discards the 'models' import if it already exists, which might be causing the issue if 'models' is not otherwise explicitly included when needed. The solution might be to ensure that 'models' is always included when relevant even if it was already on the 'imports' set, without discarding it. This could prevent scenarios where its absence leads to NameError. It's also important to note the detailed checks and sorting of imports, as well as special handling of migrations that need manual copying, which all might relate to the issue being reported.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
