The migration file is missing an import statement for the 'models' module. Given that the error occurs in a generated migration file and the models are correctly defined in the application's models.py, the problem likely resides in the Django migration framework. The most relevant file seems to be django/db/migrations/writer.py, as it is responsible for writing migration files. Additionally, django/db/migrations/operations/models.py is also a candidate as it handles model operations during migrations. Searching these files specifically for any issues or missing imports concerning the 'models' module should help identify the root cause.",

This could lead to the issue where the 'models' module is not defined if it's not explicitly imported beforehand. This is evident in the 'as_string' method where the imports are managed; 'models' is not automatically added to the imports list unless explicitly configured in the operations or other dependencies. This may explain the missing import statement for 'models', which leads to the NameError encountered during migration execution.

The provided context and search results offer valuable insights into the potential areas of the codebase that might be responsible for generating these migration files. The search results contain several spans from the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file, which seems relevant as it deals with model operations during migrations. However, the most pertinent section of the codebase appears to be in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, as it contains classes responsible for writing migrations, namely the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter'. The methods 'serialize' and 'as_string' in the 'MigrationWriter' class are particularly relevant as they handle the serialization of migration operations and the generation of the migration file content. These methods are crucial for ensuring that all necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models', are included in the migration files. Therefore, further scrutiny of these methods is warranted to identify any missing imports or potential bugs in the logic that decides which imports to include in the migration files. Given this analysis, it's clear that the code spans in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file are the most relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

This could lead to the issue where the 'models' module is not defined if it's not explicitly imported beforehand. This is evident in the 'as_string' method where the imports are managed; 'models' is not automatically added to the imports list unless explicitly configured in the operations or other dependencies. This may explain the missing import statement for 'models', which leads to the NameError encountered during migration execution. The next step is to probe 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' to identify how 'models' are handled when creating model operations to understand if there's a failure in propagating this import requirement.",

This error occurs in the generated migration file because Django's migration writer does not consistently include the 'models' import from 'django.db'. The key elements to look for in the codebase are the logic for generating migration files, specifically the sections related to serializing model operations, where imports for models might be missed or inadvertently omitted. \n\nGiven the current file context from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', we see a class 'MigrationWriter' responsible for writing migration files. The 'as_string' method of this class assembles the migration content, but it appears to handle imports in a way that might miss adding 'from django.db import models' when necessary. This correlates with the reported issue. \n\nIn examining the new search results from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', we see numerous operations related to model manipulations that Django might serialize into a migration file. Specifically, the 'CreateModel' operation is notable, as it initializes new model definitions in migrations. The code here defines how model creation operations are deconstructed and represented in migrations, which directly relates to the issue of missing imports in generated migration files. \n\nBased on this analysis, the identified relevant code spans would include the entire 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' for its role in migration file generation, as well as sections of 'models.py' operations especially the 'CreateModel' and 'ModelOperation' classes, which serialize model-related actions into migration scripts.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
