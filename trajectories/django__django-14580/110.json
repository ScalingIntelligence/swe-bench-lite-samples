Specifically, the 'models' module is not being imported, leading to a 'NameError'. To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase related to the 'MigrationWriter' class within the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module. Emphasis should be placed on the methods responsible for generating and serializing migration operations, especially those involved in creating model definitions. Additionally, I'll include the 'OperationWriter' class, which interacts with 'MigrationWriter' to ensure a comprehensive search. The likely focus of the search is on the 'operation serialization' and 'class definition creation' aspects of the migration process.",
