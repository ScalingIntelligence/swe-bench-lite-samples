The former contains the MigrationWriter class which is responsible for writing migration files. The relevant code spans are within the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, particularly where imports are managed and the migration file content is generated. The issue likely arises because the MigrationWriter does not properly handle the addition of the 'from django.db import models' statement when generating the migration file.
