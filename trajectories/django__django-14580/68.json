Based on the error trace and the given context, the problem seems to originate in the migration generation process, likely in the django.db.migrations.writer module where the MigrationWriter class is responsible for writing out migration files. Investigating the CreateModel operation in the django.db.migrations.operations.models module might also be relevant, as it deals directly with creating models in migrations. Additionally, inspecting the logic in the makemigrations command in django.core.management.commands.makemigrations could provide insights into how migrations are generated and whether the import statement should be included automatically in all cases.",

This causes a NameError when the migration file is executed. Analyzing the search results, the most relevant file appears to be 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', as it contains the 'MigrationWriter' class responsible for writing migration files. Within this file, the 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class is particularly relevant, as it constructs the string representation of the migration file. Notably, the method involves creating 'operations' and 'dependencies', which are parts of the migration file where the missing import might be needed. Examining the 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', it's clear that this class is directly involved in the creation of model migrations. Its '__init__' method sets up the model creation operation, which includes fields and bases, making it a critical part of the migration process. Lastly, 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py' contains the command logic for generating migrations, including handling user inputs and writing migration files, which aligns with the reported issue's context. Based on this analysis, the identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the missing import statement in the migration file.",

Additionally, the CreateModel operation in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py involves creating models and could be another potential area for this issue, particularly since the error arises when dealing with model definitions in migrations. The makemigrations command logic in django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py is also germane, as it orchestrates the generation of migration files and uses the MigrationWriter class.
