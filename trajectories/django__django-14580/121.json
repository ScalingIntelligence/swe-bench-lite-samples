The relevant code spans are identified in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' where the 'MigrationWriter' class is defined and used to generate migration files. The issue indicates that the 'models' import is missing in the generated migration file, which can be related to how 'MigrationWriter' constructs the migration file content. Specifically, the 'as_string' method in 'MigrationWriter' is responsible for formatting the final migration file content, including imports. The provided code spans in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' include methods related to serialization, initialization, and the actual generation of the migration file. Based on the reported issue, the relevant spans are those in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' dealing with the creation and formatting of migration files, particularly where imports are managed.

Upon examination, I observed that the provided code already imports 'models' from 'django.db', but it does so conditionally, depending on whether 'migrations' needs to handle models. The error in the issue indicates that the import statement for 'models' is missing in a generated migration file. Specifically, it appears in the 'serialize' method of the `OperationWriter` class. Given this information, it is evident that relevant code is present in the file context. However, the issue suggests that the import statement for 'models' might not always be included correctly, which could warrant further investigation of this specific aspect in the context of the error reported.",
