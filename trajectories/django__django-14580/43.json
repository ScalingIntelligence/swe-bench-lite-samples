Specifically, the `as_string` method is responsible for constructing the migration file's content, including managing imports. The code currently checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and takes some action accordingly. However, from the context provided, it's evident that this logic isn't comprehensive or correct. Instead of discarding the 'models' import and re-adding it as part of a combined import statement, it should ensure that 'models' is always present if needed, which might involve a deeper inspection of what operations the migration includes. This will require fine-tuning the import management to ensure 'models' is added whenever operations related to models are present in the migration.",
