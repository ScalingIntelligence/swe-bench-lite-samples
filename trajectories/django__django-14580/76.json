The issue specifically points to the `django.db.migrations.writer` module, which is responsible for writing the migration file. The relevant code spans include the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes, as they handle the serialization of operations and the overall structure of the migration file. The `OperationWriter.serialize` method is particularly important as it serializes each operation and should ensure that all necessary imports are included. Additionally, the `MigrationWriter` class is responsible for managing the overall structure of the migration file, including the file header and the imports section. The `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file is also relevant as it defines the `CreateModel` operation, which is likely involved in the generation of the problematic migration.

The serialization process in MigrationWriter should be examined for places where the import for 'models' can be automatically added. Additionally, the CreateModel class is where the fields for the new model are defined, and it directly interacts with 'django.db.models'. The serialize method in MigrationWriter should ensure that any necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models', are included in the generated migration file to prevent such errors.",

Analyzing the provided search results, I focused on the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' to identify if there are any methods or code spans responsible for adding imports to the migration files. The 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class is particularly relevant as it assembles the final migration file content. Within this method, the handling of imports is crucial. The method accumulates imports and ensures they are included at the top of the migration file. By examining this method and related logic, it becomes clear that the import 'from django.db import models' should be automatically added by the framework if needed. However, the current logic might fail to include this import in certain scenarios, leading to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are within the 'as_string' method of the 'MigrationWriter' class, specifically the part where imports are handled and added to the final migration file content.",
