Specifically, the 'as_string' method within MigrationWriter constructs the migration file content, including the operations and dependencies.

The current file context suggests that the relevant files are 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py' and 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. The latter file is already identified as containing relevant code. The new search results focus on 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and provide additional context and methods within the MigrationWriter class. I need to identify code spans within this file that are related to migration file generation, including imports and serialization processes. The goal is to pinpoint the exact locations where imports are assembled and written to the migration file to ensure the 'models' module is consistently included. Given the complexity, I should review each method and determine the most critical spans for the reported issue. Based on the analysis, I will then decide if the search task is complete or if further investigation is needed.",

Given this information from both the issue and the file context, it seems appropriate to conclude that the provided file context is indeed relevant and possibly complete regarding this issue, but further testing and inspection around the 'bases' attribute handling in the MigrationWriter class is suggested to confirm and address the absence of the 'models' import during migration file generation.",
