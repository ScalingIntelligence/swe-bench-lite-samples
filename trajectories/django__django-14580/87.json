These files are relevant because they involve the generation and operations of migrations in Django.\n\nIn 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for writing migration files. The class method 'as_string' handles the serialization of the migration and its imports. The relevant span 'MigrationWriter.__init__' initializes the migration writer, and 'MigrationWriter.as_string' specifically deals with generating the string representation of the migration, including the necessary imports. The code in this span attempts to add the 'from django.db import models' import but only if it is already present, which might be the source of the issue. This section is directly related to the missing import statement problem mentioned in the issue.\n\nIn 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is defined, which is an operation used to create models during migrations. Although this class is not directly responsible for the import issue, it is relevant context for understanding how model operations are handled within migrations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code span in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' dealing with imports in the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method should be inspected further to address the missing import issue.",
