Two primary areas to focus on are the 'CreateModel' operation in 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' and the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django.db.migrations.writer'.

The provided search results include two files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the MigrationWriter class is responsible for generating the migration file. The 'as_string' method of this class constructs the content of the migration file, including the crucial 'imports' section. Currently, the code checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports, and if so, it discards this and adds 'from django.db import migrations, models', otherwise, it only adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This suggests that the issue might be related to where and how imports are managed within this class. Additionally, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' contains the operations related to models but does not directly affect the import statement issue. Based on this analysis, focusing on the MigrationWriter class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' seems most relevant to address the missing import statement, particularly the 'as_string' method.",

The issue may stem from the handling of imports in this method, particularly the conditional check for adding 'models' to the imports. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is pertinent as it directly involves the creation of model migrations and their specifications, which may interact with the import logic in 'MigrationWriter'.
