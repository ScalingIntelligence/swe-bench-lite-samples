Looking at the provided context, the relevant file seems to be 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', as it contains the `MigrationWriter` class which is responsible for writing migration files. Additionally, checking the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file might also be beneficial, as it deals directly with model operations in migrations. The search should focus on these files to identify where the 'models' import might be missing or incorrectly handled.",

The search results include relevant portions of the Django codebase that handle the generation of migration files. Specifically, the django/db/migrations/writer.py file contains the MigrationWriter class, which is responsible for serializing migrations into Python files. The MigrationWriter.as_string method constructs the migration file content, including the import statements. It's evident from the code that the imports set is managed and sorted here, and there's a specific handling for 'from django.db import models'. This suggests that the issue might be rooted in how these imports are managed or how they're being added to the set. Furthermore, the OperationWriter class in the same file is responsible for serializing individual migration operations, which might also be a point of interest for missing imports in deeper operation serializations. Additionally, the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file defines model-related operations that are used in migrations, which, although not directly referenced in the current context of missing imports, are integral to understanding the migration process in Django. Overall, the identified code spans in django/db/migrations/writer.py are highly relevant to the reported issue.",
