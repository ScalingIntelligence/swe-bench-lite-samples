The search results include a significant part of the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which is responsible for generating migration files. By analyzing the code, it is clear that the `MigrationWriter` class and its methods handle the serialization and generation of migration files. Notably, the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class constructs the content of the migration file, including imports, dependencies, and operations. The code currently ensures that imports are properly handled, but it seems to miss an explicit addition of 'from django.db import models' if it is needed by any of the operations. This explains why the generated migration file lacks the necessary import statement, leading to the NameError when 'models' is not defined.

The code checks if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports, and if so, it modifies the import statement to include 'models'. If 'models' is not present, it only adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This suggests that the import for 'models' might not be added if it's not already included by default.

The logic checks its presence in the 'imports' set, and if absent, adds 'from django.db import migrations, models'. However, if 'from django.db import models' is already in the 'imports' set, it ensures that 'migrations' is also included. This logic should technically prevent 'models' from being missing in the imports.
