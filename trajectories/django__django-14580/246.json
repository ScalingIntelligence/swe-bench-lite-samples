This leads to a 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' error when executing the migration. Given the context provided, the primary suspect for the bug is the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module, as it is responsible for writing the migration files. To resolve this, I should narrow down the search to this module and the surrounding modules that may interact with it, such as 'django.db.migrations.state', 'django.db.migrations.operations.models', and 'django.db.migrations.serializer'.",
