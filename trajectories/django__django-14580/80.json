Upon examining the search results, it is clear that the relevant part of the codebase lies in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, specifically the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method. This method is responsible for generating the content of the migration file. The 'as_string' method currently attempts to add the 'from django.db import models' import statement but only if it is already present. The logic for adding 'models' seems incomplete, which could lead to the issue described. The solution might involve ensuring that 'from django.db import models' is always added if 'models' is needed within the migration file.",
