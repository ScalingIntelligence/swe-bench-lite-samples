The error message 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' indicates that the 'models' module is not being imported in the migration file. Given the context provided in the issue, it's plausible that the bug might be in the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module, particularly in the 'MigrationWriter' class or related classes responsible for writing migration files. Consequently, my approach will focus on searching within the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module and related modules involved in migration file generation and model operations.",
