This error is likely due to the migration writer not adding the necessary import for 'models' from 'django.db', resulting in invalid Python code. From the search results, the key section to review is the `MigrationWriter` class within `django/db/migrations/writer.py`. This class handles the creation of migration files and their contents. Notably, the `as_string` method is responsible for generating the string representation of the migration, including the necessary imports. In this method, the logic for handling imports is observed. Initially, it looks for the import line 'from django.db import models' in the set of imports. If found, it discards this specific line and adds 'from django.db import migrations, models' instead. However, if the import line 'from django.db import models' is not present, it only adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This suggests that the logic for ensuring that 'models' is included might be flawed because it relies on a prior existence of the 'from django.db import models' line. Correctly, it should always ensure that 'models' is imported if it's needed in the migration file. Thus, the relevant code spans are from the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class.",

The 'MigrationWriter' class in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file is responsible for generating the migration scripts. The 'OperationWriter' class is also involved in serializing operations in the migration file. The key to resolving this issue lies in ensuring that the import statement 'from django.db import models' is included in the generated migration file.

This omission is likely what leads to the missing import in the generated migration script, resulting in the 'NameError'.
