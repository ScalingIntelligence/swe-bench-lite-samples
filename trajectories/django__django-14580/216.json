The reported issue suggests that the module 'django.db.migrations.writer' might be responsible. Upon analyzing the search results, the file 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' contains the relevant code spans, particularly the 'CreateModel' class. This class is responsible for creating model operations in the migration files. The '__init__' method of 'CreateModel' initializes the model creation with fields, options, bases, and managers. One critical aspect is ensuring that the 'models' module is imported correctly, which is evident in the 'imports' span at the beginning of the file. This import is crucial because it ensures that references to 'models' are not undefined, which aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to missing import statements in Django's migration files.",

The method includes a part where it processes and adds imports for the generated migration file. However, it seems to handle imports for 'migrations' and other specified modules but does not explicitly ensure the inclusion of the 'models' import when it's needed.

The relevant code spans should include sections where the import is managed or where the migration file is generated. By examining the search results, I identified two key files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method seem crucial for generating the migration file. The current implementation in 'as_string' manipulates the imports for the file but does not explicitly ensure that 'models' is always imported if referenced. In 'models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is responsible for creating the model in the migration, which is directly related to the issue. Specifically, the '__init__' and 'deconstruct' methods in 'CreateModel' and the 'serialize' method in 'MigrationWriter' are relevant as they handle the model data and the creation of the migration file respectively. Given that the issue requires ensuring 'models' is imported when needed in the generated migration file, these code spans are essential. They cover the code responsible for managing imports and the actual operations that go into the migration file. However, the existing code does not guarantee the import of 'models' when it's needed in the migration file content, indicating a possible gap that needs to be addressed.",
