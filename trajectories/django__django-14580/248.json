This suggests that the problem might be within the module responsible for writing the migration files, likely 'django.db.migrations.writer'. Given the stack trace and the migration file's content, the focus should be on the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes in 'writer.py'. Additionally, considering the context and the specific error, it's important to verify if the 'names_to_delete' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class correctly handles and imports all necessary modules, including the 'models' module. The search should also cover the 'operations' module which defines operations like 'CreateModel', as it directly references the 'models' module. Lastly, the 'makemigrations' command file should be examined to ensure that all necessary imports are properly handled.",

This is a common issue with Django's migration generation and is handled in the 'django.db.migrations' submodule. In the provided search results, we must focus on django/db/migrations/writer.py, as this file contains the MigrationWriter class which is responsible for generating migration files. The imports section in writer.py does not include 'from django.db import models', which is likely causing the NameError. Given the current context, and in the interest of tracing where in the process can the possible omission of this import line can happen, it's key to inspect the available code spans, notably sections from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', where we do not see the 'from django.db import models' which is yet important to define 'models' functionality in the migration files and avoid errors existent from bugs or misconfigurations. Further research could deem code within the models.py or the makemigrations.py also as relevant for instance, considering their defined and custom stand of handling predefined migrations vs. process errors at runtime.",

This aligns with the reported issue where an auto-generated migration file lacks the necessary import statement for 'models', leading to the 'NameError'.

To further diagnose the issue, a deeper examination of the 'MigrationWriter' class methods such as 'as_string', 'serialize_create_model', and 'serialize' is required. These methods are crucial as they are responsible for generating the content of the migration file. Additionally, the 'OperationWriter' class and its methods should be inspected, focusing on how operations like 'CreateModel' are handled and how module imports are managed within these operations. Given the specific error pointing to the 'models' module, it's essential to ensure that all generated code snippets correctly reference and import 'models'.

This leads to a NameError when the migration is executed. The issue is likely caused by the django.db.migrations.writer module, which is responsible for generating the migration files. \n\nAnalyzing the provided file context and search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are found within the django/db/migrations/writer.py file. Specifically, the MigrationWriter class is of interest, as it is responsible for writing the migration files. The current file context already includes the '__init__' method of the MigrationWriter class, which initializes the writer with the migration and includes a header flag. \n\nThe new search results reveal additional methods within the MigrationWriter class, including 'as_string', 'basedir', 'filename', 'path', 'serialize', 'register_serializer', and 'unregister_serializer'. The 'as_string' method is particularly relevant as it constructs the migration script, including the operations and dependencies. However, a crucial aspect missing is the import statement for the 'models' module, which is likely causing the NameError. \n\nThe search results also include the OperationWriter class and its 'serialize' method, which is used within the MigrationWriter's 'as_string' method. This indicates that the serialization logic for operations might also be involved in the issue. \n\nGiven the evidence, it is clear that the relevant code spans are within the django/db/migrations/writer.py file, specifically focusing on the MigrationWriter class and its methods. The identified spans provide a strong basis to debug and potentially fix the issue related to the missing import statement.",

The generated migration file attempts to use 'models' without importing it, leading to a NameError. The issue suggests that the problem might be in the module 'django.db.migrations.writer'. Looking through the provided file context and search results, the key areas to focus on are the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. Specifically, the 'serialize' method in 'OperationWriter' and the 'as_string' method in 'MigrationWriter' are relevant because these methods are responsible for generating the content of the migration file. However, in the provided context, there is already a check to add the 'models' import, which complicates the understanding of the issue. Further review of 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py' is needed to see if there's a disconnect in the workflow where the import might be omitted.\n\nGiven the information, the 'Identify' function should be called to mark the relevant spans in the codebase that pertain to the missing import statement and the generation of migration files.",

The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method handles the conversion of operations into a string format suitable for writing into the migration file, and it calls 'MigrationWriter.serialize' to handle the serialization of each argument. However, the 'MigrationWriter.serialize' method relies on the 'serializer_factory' to handle different types of arguments but does not explicitly ensure that the 'models' module is imported when it is needed. This could be a potential cause for the missing import statement in the generated migration file, leading to the 'NameError'. The 'MigrationWriter' class initialization in the 'makemigrations' command file does not appear to explicitly ensure that all module imports, including 'models', are handled at the initialization level. To address the issue, it would be crucial to ensure that the serialization process includes the necessary imports for modules like 'models'. Suggesting to search for instances where the 'models' module is referenced in operations without the corresponding import could help identify the missing import statement.",
