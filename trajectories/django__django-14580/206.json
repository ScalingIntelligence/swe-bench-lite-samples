The search results focus on the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which contains the `MigrationWriter` class responsible for writing migration files. The `as_string` method within this class is particularly relevant as it constructs the string representation of the migration file, including the necessary imports. The method currently ensures that 'from django.db import migrations' is included but does not explicitly ensure 'models' is imported when needed. This suggests that the issue likely originates from this method not being robust enough to handle all necessary imports dynamically. By identifying and returning the relevant spans within `MigrationWriter` class, especially the `as_string` method, we can pinpoint the area in the codebase that needs to be corrected to ensure all necessary imports are included in the generated migration files.",

This leads to a 'NameError' because 'models' is not defined. The search results present the context of the 'MigrationWriter' class within Django's migration module, which is responsible for generating migration files. The relevant code spans are primarily within the 'MigrationWriter' class methods such as 'as_string' and 'serialize', which handle the generation of the migration script and its imports. A critical point in the 'as_string' method is where it checks for the presence of 'from django.db import models' and adds 'from django.db import migrations, models' if 'models' is already in the imports to avoid duplication. However, it currently only adds 'from django.db import migrations' otherwise, missing the required import of models. This oversight in handling imports directly corresponds to the issue reported, suggesting a bug in the handling of imports within the migration generation process.",

This leads to a NameError when the migration is executed. The search results include code from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' which is likely responsible for writing the migration files, including the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods. The relevant code spans seem to be those that handle the creation of the migration file, particularly 'MigrationWriter.as_string' which constructs the content of the migration file. There, the handling of imports is crucial; the current implementation either adds 'from django.db import migrations' or 'from django.db import migrations, models' based on the presence of 'models' in the imports set. This logic appears to correctly handle the importing of 'models', so the issue likely lies in how the 'imports' set is populated or manipulated before this point. Further examination of the 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method is also warranted as it populates the imports set. The 'django/db/migrations/loader.py' file was also included in the search results but appears to be less directly related to the migration file generation and more to the loading of migrations themselves, so less focused attention is needed there for now.",
