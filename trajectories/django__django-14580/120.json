Given the detailed description and the error message 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined', it's clear that the migration file creation process is missing an import for 'models'. This indicates a potential bug in the Django migration writer module. The first step is to search within the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module for any instances where 'models' should be imported but isn't. Additionally, we should look into 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' where model operations are defined and executed, ensuring these operations include the necessary imports.",

This issue is likely related to the module django.db.migrations.writer responsible for generating migration files. The provided search results include two files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the class MigrationWriter is responsible for generating the migration file's content. Specifically, the method 'as_string' constructs the migration file, including imports, operations, and dependencies. However, it appears that the import statement 'from django.db import models' is managed but not directly added if not present in the imports set. This might explain the missing import statement issue. The second file, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', defines operations like CreateModel, which are used in the migrations. While this file is related to the operations performed in migrations, the core issue of missing imports seems centered on the MigrationWriter in the first file. Based on the analysis, the key code spans relevant to this issue are in the MigrationWriter class, particularly the 'as_string' method and how it handles imports. Specifically, the handling of default imports like 'models' could be improved to ensure they are always included when necessary. Therefore, focusing on the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' should address the core issue.",

This issue affects the functionality of the MigrationWriter class in django/db/migrations/writer.py. The provided search results include relevant code spans in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and django/db/migrations/writer.py, particularly in the MigrationWriter and OperationWriter classes where the logic for generating migration files resides.\n\n1. The import section in django/db/migrations/writer.py already includes the necessary imports for migrations but does not include the 'models' import when it's necessary. The issue is likely in the logic that decides which imports to include in the generated migration files, specifically in the 'as_string' method of the MigrationWriter class.\n\n2. A relevant code span in django/db/migrations/writer.py is the 'as_string' method which constructs the migration file content. It checks and adds necessary imports but seems to miss adding 'from django.db import models' when it's needed.\n\n3. The OperationWriter class in django/db/migrations/writer.py also plays a role in serializing individual operations within migrations and collecting the necessary imports.\n\nBased on the current file context and the search results, the solution to the reported issue involves adjusting the logic in the MigrationWriter's 'as_string' method to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is always included when operations reference Django models, especially in the 'CreateModel' operation type found in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py.\n\nGiven this understanding, the task is to identify the relevant code spans that need adjustments to resolve the issue and provide an accurate and complete response.",

These parts of the codebase handle the creation of migration files and the operations within them, which directly relate to the reported issue of missing import statements causing 'NameError' in generated migrations. The code examines how operations are serialized and how imports are managed. It does not, however, explicitly check and include the 'models' import in all generated migration files, which could be the cause of the reported issue. Thus, while the provided files are relevant, the issue might still persist because the specific handling of imports (especially of 'models') in generated migration files is not thoroughly ensured.

The relevant files identified in the provided context are 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. The search results further detail these files. It's clear that the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'writer.py' is responsible for generating the migration file content. The method 'as_string' is the key focus as it constructs the file's content, including the imports section. However, the logic doesn't seem to explicitly import 'models' when it's needed, which might be causing the issue. Given that the 'OperationWriter' class also plays a role in serializing operations and their imports, it's worth examining how it handles imports for each operation. Specifically, the 'serialize' method in 'OperationWriter' should be checked to ensure it includes necessary imports that operations depend on.",
