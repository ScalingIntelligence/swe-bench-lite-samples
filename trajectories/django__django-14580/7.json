Given the detailed description, the focus should be on identifying the part of the Django codebase responsible for generating migrations. Specifically, the `MigrationWriter` class in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` is a prime suspect, as it handles the serialization of migration files. Additionally, the `CreateModel` operation in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is relevant, as it deals with model creation during migrations. These two areas are likely points of interest for debugging and fixing the missing import statement issue.",
