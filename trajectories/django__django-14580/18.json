This leads to a 'NameError' when the migration file is executed. The search results primarily focus on the Django migration framework, specifically within the 'django.db.migrations' package. The most relevant file seems to be 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', especially the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods. The 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for generating the migration files. The issue might be related to the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, where the imports section is managed. The method constructs the import statements but does not seem to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included when necessary. This omission could lead to the missing import statement in the generated migration file.\n\nLooking at the specific spans from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method adds imports, but the checks and updates to the imports set seem incomplete. It handles 'migrations' but does not explicitly check for and add 'models' when required. This gap could be the reason for the missing import statement in the generated migration files. Therefore, the identified span 'django/db/migrations/writer.py#MigrationWriter.as_string' is highly relevant to the issue as it directly deals with constructing the migration file including its import statements.",
