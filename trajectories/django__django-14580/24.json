However, only the code spans within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' directly address the issue of generating the migration file and managing imports. The 'MigrationWriter' class and its method 'as_string' handle the generation of the migration file content, including the management of imports. Specifically, the method checks for and handles the 'from django.db import models' import, indicating where the import handling logic could be adjusted to fix the issue.

However, it specifically discards the 'from django.db import models' import if it is found among the imports, and instead, it adds 'from django.db import migrations'.
