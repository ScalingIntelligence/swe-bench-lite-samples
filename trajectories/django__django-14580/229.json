The error message 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' indicates that the 'models' module is not being imported in the generated migration file. Looking at the provided context, the problematic line is 'bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model)', where 'models.Model' is not recognized. This suggests that the missing import statement is for 'from django.db import models'. The relevant files to investigate are 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and possibly 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. These files need to be checked to ensure that the import statement for 'models' is included before its usage in the migration file generation process.",

The reported issue highlights that the 'models' import is missing in the generated migration file, specifically when the migration file includes operations that reference the 'models' module. I will examine the provided search results to locate the relevant code spans within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' that might be responsible for this behavior. The focus will be on the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'writer.py' as it is responsible for assembling the final migration file, and within that, the 'as_string' method which constructs the migration content. Additionally, I will check the 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method, as this is where individual operations are processed. In 'models.py', I will review the 'CreateModel' class, which is used for operations related to model creation and could potentially provide insights into how it interacts with the migration process. After examining these sections, I will determine which code spans are most relevant to the reported issue and ensure that they provide a comprehensive view of the codebase's handling of migrations and imports.",

The provided context from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' does not explicitly handle the import of 'models' separately from 'migrations', which might cause the issue. However, the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file already includes 'from django.db import models', indicating that this import is typically present where model operations are defined. Given that the 'writer.py' file does not separately ensure the 'models' import, and based on the detailed analysis, it appears that the relevant context for the issue is provided.
