The search results include relevant code in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. In `writer.py`, the `MigrationWriter` class handles the creation of migration files, including the `as_string` method which assembles the migration string and manages imports. The relevant lines are where imports are added to the `imports` set and then formatted into the migration file. The key section is where `from django.db import models` is specifically handled. In `operations/models.py`, the `CreateModel` class is responsible for adding models to the migration state. The reported issue suggests that the migration file generator might be failing to include the required import for `models`. The relevant code spans in `writer.py` include the `as_string` method where import handling is detailed, particularly the section adding imports and managing the `models` import. The `operations/models.py` code span includes the imports at the beginning and the `CreateModel` class definition, which interacts with the `models` module.

The class is responsible for generating the migration file, including the imports and operations. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is relevant as it deals with the creation of model operations within the migration. The analysis reveals that the current implementation in 'MigrationWriter' does not explicitly include 'from django.db import models' in the imports when writing the migration file, which leads to the reported issue. However, the current code attempts to handle this by adding 'from django.db import migrations, models' if 'from django.db import models' is found in the imports. This suggests that the issue might be due to the order or conditions under which imports are added. Given the present context of the code, it is possible that additional specific conditions or updates in the migration writing process might be needed to resolve the issue completely.",

It includes logic to manage imports for the migration files, including handling 'from django.db import models' specifically. The 'CreateModel' operation, part of the model operations in Django migrations, is also relevant as it directly deals with creating models during migrations. Based on the context provided, it seems that the issue might be related to how imports are managed within the 'MigrationWriter' class, particularly when handling the 'models' import. There is a specific handling of this import which removes any standalone 'from django.db import models' and replaces it with 'from django.db import migrations, models'. This might cause issues if there are scenarios where 'models' need to be imported without 'migrations' alongside it. Further investigation is needed into how these specific import handling logics affect migration file generation.",

The code spans in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' related to this method need to be examined to determine if they correctly handle this import, or if there's a logic flaw that causes it to be omitted in the generated migration file.
