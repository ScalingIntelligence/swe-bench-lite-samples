The error message indicates that the `models` module is being referenced in the migration file without being imported, leading to a `NameError`. Upon examining the search results from `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, it's clear that the file does not have a direct import for `models` in the context of writing migration files. The `MigrationWriter` class, which is responsible for generating the migration file content, does not explicitly handle the import of `models` as part of its imports. Instead, it only adds `from django.db import migrations` to the imports set. This omission of `models` when it's being used in the migration file is precisely why the migration generated results in a `NameError`. The relevant code spans in the search results that need updating are those that handle the creation of the imports set and the generation of the migration file's content, specifically within the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method.",
