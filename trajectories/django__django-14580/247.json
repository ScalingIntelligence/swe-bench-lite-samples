The search results provided include multiple relevant files and functions from the 'django.db.migrations' module, particularly focusing on 'writer.py' and 'serializer.py'. In 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for writing migration files, and its 'as_string' method constructs the migration file content, including handling imports. The 'OperationWriter' class within 'writer.py' is also relevant as it serializes individual operations within the migration. Additionally, 'serializer.py' contains various serializers used by 'MigrationWriter' to handle different types of data, including 'ModelFieldSerializer' which is likely relevant for the 'models' import issue due to its connection with Django models. The 'ModelOperation' class in 'models.py' under 'operations' is also pertinent as it deals with operations related to models, suggesting potential points where an import for 'models' might be necessary or related to the issue. Considering all these elements, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the missing import issue described in the reported issue.",
