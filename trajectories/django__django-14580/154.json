Specifically, the error indicates that the 'models' module is not defined, suggesting that an import statement for 'models' is missing in the migration file. Given this, the focus should be on identifying code in the migration writer that handles the construction of migration files, particularly the section responsible for adding necessary imports. The provided search results include the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', which contains several code spans outlining the functionality of the 'MigrationWriter' class. The key span to examine is 'MigrationWriter.as_string', which is responsible for generating the content of the migration file, including the necessary imports. From a careful review of this span, it is evident that the code checks for specific imports and ensures the 'from django.db import migrations' statement is included, but it could potentially miss the inclusion of 'models' if not explicitly requested by operations. This suggests that the issue might be related to how imports are managed within the 'MigrationWriter' class, specifically in ensuring all necessary imports for migrations are included, such as 'models'. Therefore, the relevant code span to focus on is 'MigrationWriter.as_string' within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', as it directly affects the content of the migration files and the inclusion of necessary import statements.",

However, this handling might be causing the issue as it removes the 'models' import even when it's necessary, leading to the 'NameError'. The current code checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports, and if so, it removes and re-adds it with 'migrations', possibly causing the import to be omitted in certain scenarios. This suggests that the 'MigrationWriter' logic needs a more nuanced approach to determine when 'models' should be included to avoid such issues.",

From the provided search results, it's clear that the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file is responsible for writing the migration files, and specifically the `MigrationWriter` class and its `as_string` method are involved in this process. The issue points directly to a missing import in the generated migration file. The `as_string` method in the `MigrationWriter` class handles the generation of the migration file content and should ensure that all necessary imports are included. The current implementation only ensures that the 'migrations' module is imported, but it misses the 'models' module. The `operations` section of the migration file is particularly relevant since it directly references the 'models' module and the missing import is likely due to the absence of 'models' in the set of imports the script assigns. Therefore, the `as_string` method in the `MigrationWriter` class needs to be modified to include 'models' in the set of imports when generating the migration file. Moreover, reviewing the code around the addition of imports ensures both 'migrations' and 'models' are bundled together as part of the initial imports for the migration file generation step.",
