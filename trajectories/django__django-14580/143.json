Upon analyzing the provided context and search results, it's clear that the relevant file is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. Within this file, the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods are responsible for generating migration files. The 'as_string' method in particular constructs the content of the migration file, including the necessary imports. However, the issue lies in how imports are managed and written. Specifically, the 'from django.db import models' statement should be included in the set of imports if it's needed by the migration file, but it's being explicitly excluded or not added under certain conditions. This can be seen in the code where it checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and then discards it, replacing it with 'from django.db import migrations, models'. Identifying and fixing this logic to ensure all necessary imports are included when generating the migration file should resolve the reported issue.",
