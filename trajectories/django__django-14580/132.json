This suggests that the migration file does not properly import Django's models module, causing the error when it tries to reference 'models'. The search results provide a glimpse into Django's migration writer module (django/db/migrations/writer.py). This file contains essential methods and classes for writing migration files. Notably, it imports several modules including 'django.db.migrations.serializer' and 'django.utils.inspect', but does not explicitly address how imports for referenced models are handled when writing migration files. Given the issue at hand, it's plausible that the fault lies in how the 'MigrationWriter' class processes or writes these imports. The class includes methods like 'serialize' and 'register_serializer' which might influence how imports are handled or omitted. However, the provided search results do not directly show the code responsible for writing the actual content of the migration files. Therefore, based on the issue's description and the limited search results, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact fault without deeper inspection of the methods used by 'MigrationWriter' to generate the migration scripts, especially those involving model references. More context or code related to the 'write' or 'as_string' methods of 'MigrationWriter' would likely provide more clarity.",

The key part to look for in the code is the generation of migration files and the handling of imports within them. The search results provide valuable insights into the migration writing process, particularly the OperationWriter and MigrationWriter classes within the django/db/migrations/writer.py file. These classes seem to be central to the migration creation process and offer promising leads for understanding how import statements are managed during serialization. Additionally, the ModelFieldSerializer and ModelManagerSerializer within django/db/migrations/serializer.py indicate potential areas where model-related dependencies are serialized. These files and their methods directly relate to the creation and serialization of migrations, making them highly relevant to the issue. The absence of the 'models' import directly impacts the functionality of the generated migration scripts. While the current context and search results do not directly show the exact line of code responsible for the missing import, they provide a clear path to the areas in the codebase that need further inspection to determine why the 'models' import is omitted. The issue suggests a potential bug in the serialization logic of the MigrationWriter or the context in which the imports are being handled before writing the migration file.",

These files are key in understanding how the import statements for 'models' are handled. In 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is critical as it is responsible for the serialization of the migration and its subsequent writing to files. This class uses the 'serialize' method which leverages 'serializer_factory' to determine the appropriate serializer for the values it encounters. In 'serializer.py', we can see the 'TypeSerializer' class handling the serialization of types, including 'models.Model'. The 'ModelFieldSerializer' and 'ModelManagerSerializer' are also involved in serializing model fields and managers respectively.\n\nGiven the scope of the problem, it's plausible that the issue lies with the initial import handling in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', especially since the 'models' module is a crucial part of Django's ORM. To verify this, we should examine the 'OperationWriter' class and how it handles imports, along with the 'MigrationWriter' class where we need to check if the 'models' import is being appropriately included. Additionally, considering the functionality of the serializers in 'serializer.py', it's crucial to ensure that these are correctly encapsulating the necessary model-related imports.",

Another relevant file is `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, which is responsible for serializing different types of objects, including model fields. The `ModelFieldSerializer` class in this file is crucial for correctly representing model fields in the migration file. To fix the reported issue, modifying the `as_string` method in `MigrationWriter` class to ensure that 'models' is always imported from 'django.db' is necessary.

The 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for writing the migration files, and it uses the 'serialize' method which involves 'serializer_factory' for serializing values. The 'OperationWriter' class is also significant as it serializes individual operations within a migration. In the 'serializer.py' file, the 'TypeSerializer' class explicitly handles the serialization of 'models.Model', indicating a direct interaction with Django's ORM. However, despite these interactions, the specific handling of the 'models' import to ensure it is available in the generated migration file seems to be lacking in the presented context. To address the reported issue comprehensively, a deeper examination of how imports are managed and included in generated migration files would be necessary. This particularly involves scrutinizing the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes to ensure that necessary imports like 'models' are being correctly added to the generated Python files.",
