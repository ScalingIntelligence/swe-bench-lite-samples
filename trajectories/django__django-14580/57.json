This issue is likely caused by the `django.db.migrations.writer` module's handling of the serialization of migrations. The main focus should be on the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes within the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, as these classes are responsible for writing the migration files and handling the serialization of operations. Specifically, the `serialize` method within the `OperationWriter` class and the `serialize` class method within the `MigrationWriter` class are of particular interest, as these handle the serialization of operations that are written into the migration files. The search results include multiple spans that reference handling the serialization of different types of operations and values, including model fields, model managers, and other Django model components. These spans should be examined to ensure that all necessary imports are included during the serialization process to prevent missing imports in the generated migration files. It's also important to review the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file to understand how the `CreateModel` operation is constructed and serialized, as this operation is central to the creation of model-related migrations. This includes checking how bases, fields, and managers are handled in the `CreateModel` constructor and deconstruct method to ensure all necessary components are properly serialized and referenced. Based on the analysis, the relevant spans seem to cover the core functionalities that are likely involved in resolving the reported issue. Thus, the search task can be deemed complete as the necessary code spans have been identified.",
