The primary location where this behavior might occur is in the MigrationWriter class within the django.db.migrations.writer module, which is responsible for writing migration files. The specific error context suggests that when generating the migration file, Django fails to include an important import statement, leading to the NameError. Targeting the MigrationWriter class directly and potentially the related modules should help uncover the source of the missing import.",

By examining the search results, it is clear that the relevant file is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. Within this file, there is a class 'MigrationWriter' that is responsible for generating the migration files. The method 'as_string' in the 'MigrationWriter' class is of particular interest since it constructs the migration file's content, including imports. The current logic in 'as_string' adds only 'from django.db import migrations' if 'from django.db import models' is not explicitly requested, rather than including both models and migrations whenever models are needed. This oversight could be the cause of the reported issue. The identified code spans focus on the MigrationWriter class and its method 'as_string', providing a clear view of where the code responsible for generating migrations is located and how it handles imports.",

The code snippet shows that if 'from django.db import models' is present in the imports set, it changes this to 'from django.db import migrations, models'. If 'from django.db import models' is not in the set, it only imports 'from django.db import migrations', which suggests that the import of 'models' is conditionally included based on the presence of related code that uses 'models'.

The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that handle the generation of migration files and the inclusion of necessary imports. The key focus is on the MigrationWriter class within django/db/migrations/writer.py as it is responsible for writing the migration files. From the search results, the relevant spans are those that handle the import section of the migration file and those that involve the MigrationWriter class. Specifically, the span 'MigrationWriter.as_string' is crucial as it constructs the migration file's content, including the imports. The spans 'OperationWriter' and 'OperationWriter.serialize' also play a part as they handle the serialization of individual operations within the migration, which can influence what imports are needed. The final decision to mark as relevant the spans 'MigrationWriter', 'MigrationWriter.as_string', and 'imports' from the django/db/migrations/writer.py file was made after reviewing the entire sections of code to ensure a complete understanding. It's crucial to see all code in a section to accurately determine relevance and completeness.",

However, if 'from django.db import models' is not present in the imports set, the class adds 'from django.db import migrations' only. This behavior suggests that the 'models' import is conditionally included based on the specific requirements of the operations being processed, with the exclusion occurring if none of the operations necessitate the use of models.

Upon examining the current file context and the search results, several key areas are relevant to the issue: \n1. In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for writing migration files. The 'as_string' method of this class handles the generation of the migration file content, including the imports. \n2. The 'django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' contain various operations that can be used in a migration, such as 'CreateModel', 'DeleteModel', and 'RenameModel'. These operations might be involved in the generation of the faulty migration file.\n3. The 'MigrationWriter' class has already an 'imports' set that should include necessary imports such as 'from django.db import migrations, models'. However, if the 'models' import is not found, it should automatically add 'models' to the import statement according to the code logic. Yet, the issue suggests that the 'models' import is not being included in the generated migration file, leading to a 'NameError'. \nGiven these points, the focus should be on the 'MigrationWriter' class and its handling of imports within the 'as_string' method, specifically ensuring that the 'models' import is consistently present in the resulting migration code.",

However, if 'from django.db import models' is not present in the imports set, the class adds 'from django.db import migrations' only. This behavior suggests that the 'models' import is conditionally included based on the specific requirements of the operations being processed, with the exclusion occurring if none of the operations necessitate the use of models.
