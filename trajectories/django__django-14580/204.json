This error indicates that the migration file is trying to use the 'models' module without importing it. Investigating the relevant parts of the Django codebase is crucial to find where the import statement is either missing or not being properly handled during the migration file generation process. Focusing on the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module, where the main logic for writing migration files resides, is a good starting point. Additionally, looking into the 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' module, which contains model-related operations, might also provide insight into how the 'models' module is being used during migration generation.",

This error occurs when Django's migration generator does not properly include this import in the generated migration file, leading to a 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined'. Given the search results, it is important to focus on the code responsible for generating the migration file and ensure that it correctly includes the necessary import statements. The relevant sections of the codebase are in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', particularly the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes. These classes contain methods for serializing and writing migration operations to files, and they should handle the inclusion of necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models'. Moreover, other parts of the codebase, such as 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', are also relevant as they define model operations that would need to be serialized properly in the migration file. By examining these sections, we can identify where the import statement might be missing or where the logic for including it might be faulty.",
