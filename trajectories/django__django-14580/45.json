The context provided points to the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which is responsible for generating the migration files. The relevant code spans within this file involve the `OperationWriter` class and its `serialize` method, as this is where the migration operations are serialized into the migration file. The `MigrationWriter` class is also a central part of this process, though it doesn't directly serialize the operations. The search results confirm the presence of these classes and methods in the `writer.py` file, but don't explicitly show the logic that determines which imports to include in the generated migration file. It's likely that the issue arises from how the imports are being managed or determined within these code spans. To fix the issue, one would need to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included when generating the migration file, possibly by adjusting the logic that collects necessary imports or by explicitly adding this import if it's missing from the collected imports.",
