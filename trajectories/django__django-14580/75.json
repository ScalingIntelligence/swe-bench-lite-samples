These methods handle the serialization and writing of operations into the migration file. Notably, the 'from django.db import migrations' import exists, but there is logic within `MigrationWriter.as_string` to potentially add 'models' to this import line if it's detected in the imports set. However, there is no explicit mention or handling of ensuring the 'models' import is included when it's needed, which could explain the reported issue. It's crucial to ensure that the migration file generator properly manages and includes all necessary imports based on the operations being serialized.
