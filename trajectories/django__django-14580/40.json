This issue may arise from the django.db.migrations.writer module during the generation of migration files. The provided search results include the django/db/migrations/writer.py file, which contains the relevant code spans that could be responsible for managing imports and writing the migration files. Notably, the code within the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method handles the inclusion of necessary imports, including managing and sorting the set of imports. The code should ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included in the final set of imports if necessary. The provided code suggests that the logic for handling imports might need adjustment to ensure 'models' is included when it's required in the migration file. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' span is particularly relevant as it deals with assembling the string representation of a migration, including necessary imports.

Notably, the code checks for the presence of 'from django.db import models' in the imports set and ensures 'models' is imported alongside 'migrations' if it is detected, but adds only 'migrations' if not found. This flawed logic is likely the root cause of the issue, as it fails to consistently include the 'models' import which is necessary for the generated code to function.

The current logic in 'MigrationWriter.as_string' attempts to manage imports but does not always add 'from django.db import models' as needed. The expected behavior is for Django to generate a valid Python migration file, including all necessary imports. The provided code spans in the 'MigrationWriter' class, specifically 'MigrationWriter.as_string', highlight the logic for managing imports and generating migration files. This section is critical because it determines what imports are included in the generated migration file. The bug suggests that the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' script does not consistently include 'from django.db import models', even when the migration file references 'models'. To address this, we need to ensure that whenever a migration file references 'models', the appropriate import statement is added. Overall, the search results offer a clear view of how Django manages imports for migration files, and the issue directly relates to how these imports are handled within the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method.",
