This results in an error during the execution of the migration. The provided search_results contain the Django's migration writer implementation. From the 'MigrationWriter' class definition, the __init__ method initializes various properties of the MigrationWriter object, which are used in the subsequent methods to manage migration creation. Crucially, the 'as_string' method writes the Python source string that makes up the migration file. This method evades adding 'from django.db import models' to the imports as a safeguard, and instead prepends the 'migrations' import. This logic potentially explains the reported issue, where a migration was created with both app.models and a partial ('migrations') import but omitting 'models'. Given my understanding of the reported issue and my review of the code, in this specific instance, the conclusion must be that the report points to the necessity for the view_results to align consiciously, validating relevance. Clearly, this behavior ought to be adjusted throughout the various modules to rectify the problem appropriately.",

The provided file context is from the django/db/migrations/writer.py file, specifically the MigrationWriter class. This class is responsible for writing the migration files. Intriguingly, the code within the MigrationWriter class already includes several import statements, including 'from django.db import migrations'. However, it does not explicitly handle the import of 'models' unless 'from django.db import models' is already present in the imports set. This conditionally adds 'from django.db import migrations, models' if the statement is present, but it does not ensure 'models' is imported when needed. This oversight seems to be the root cause of the issue.
