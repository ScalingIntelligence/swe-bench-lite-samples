The error 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' suggests that the 'models' module is not being imported in the migration file. The relevant files related to migration generation and writing are likely within the django.db.migrations package. Specifically, the MigrationWriter and OperationWriter classes in writer.py, and the CreateModel operation in operations/models.py are of interest. Additionally, examining the makemigrations command in core/management may help. Since the issue involves missing imports in migration files, explore the MigrationWriter and CreateModel classes, and also inspect how imports are handled in the makemigrations command.",

The key element to focus on is the generation of the migration file content and ensuring that all necessary imports are included. Specifically, we should look for sections where the migration file is being constructed and written to the disk.\n\nIn the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` that handle the serialization and writing of migrations. The `OperationWriter` class and the `MigrationWriter` class are particularly relevant. The `OperationWriter.serialize` method deals with the serialization of operation arguments, which includes resolving imports and writing them appropriately. The `MigrationWriter.serialize` method and other methods in the `MigrationWriter` class handle the serialization of migration values and the registration of custom serializers for different types, which are crucial for ensuring the correct structure of the generated migration files.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the focus should be on ensuring that the `models` import is handled correctly during the serialization and writing process. The relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` include the imports at the top of the file, the `OperationWriter.serialize` method, and the `MigrationWriter` class. These sections are critical for understanding how migrations are serialized and written to the filesystem, including how imports are managed.\n\nTo complete the search task, we need to extract these relevant code spans and ensure that they are identified as relevant to the reported issue. The identified code spans should demonstrate how the migration file generation process works and how imports, such as `models`, are included during this process.",

The method involves creating a buffer (`self.buff`) to accumulate lines of the serialized operation, handling different types of arguments, and managing imports. It uses the `MigrationWriter.serialize` method to handle the actual serialization of each argument. This suggests that the method where imports are handled might be in the `serialize` method of the MigrationWriter class or in the `MigrationWriter.serialize` static method, which could be elsewhere in the file. Additionally, since the error involves the 'models' module not being defined, it's crucial to check if this import, along with others necessary for model operations, is being correctly managed and included in the generated migration files.",

The search results include several code spans from the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which appears to be the relevant module for handling the generation of migration files. The key section to focus on is the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method, as it constructs the string representation of the migration file. This method generates the migration content, including the imports section, operations, dependencies, and other relevant parts. The issue is likely caused by the logic in this method not correctly including the 'from django.db import models' statement. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on are those that construct the imports section in the `as_string` method. This includes the handling of imports in the `OperationWriter.serialize` method and the sorting and inclusion of imports in the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method. The analysis of these spans will help in understanding why the 'models' import is not being included in the generated migration file.",
