This issue is likely related to how Django's migration system handles the serialization and generation of migration files. From the search results, two key files are identified: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py'. These files contain classes and methods responsible for writing and serializing migrations. In 'writer.py', the MigrationWriter class and its methods, particularly 'as_string' and 'serialize', are crucial as they handle the generation of migration files. The current logic ensures certain imports are added but it does not explicitly add 'from django.db import models' unless 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports. The related 'serializer.py' file contains various serialization methods for different data types, potentially affecting how the 'models' module is handled. The lack of an explicit check and addition of 'models' import could be the root cause of the issue. The relevant code spans are those handling import management in 'MigrationWriter.as_string' and serialization logic in 'MigrationWriter.serialize' and 'OperationWriter.serialize'.",
