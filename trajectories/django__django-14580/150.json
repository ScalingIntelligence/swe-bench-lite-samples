The search results provided include multiple files from the Django migrations module. The django/db/migrations/writer.py file is particularly relevant as it contains the logic for writing migration files. Within this file, the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for generating the migration file content. It lacks an explicit import statement for 'models', which could be the root cause of the reported issue. This code span is identified as highly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file is also relevant as it defines the operations applied to models during migrations and includes an import for 'from django.db import models'. This supports the theory that the missing import in the writer module could be causing the error. The 'OperationWriter' class in writer.py is also examined for its role in serializing operations, which may interact with model definitions, further emphasizing the need for the 'models' import. Given this analysis, the identified span in writer.py is critical for addressing the reported missing import issue, and search results indicate potential areas where the import statement might be missing or needs to be added to resolve the issue.",

The current file context and search results primarily focus on the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, which is responsible for writing migration files. Tracking the functionality of 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes reveals they are involved in serializing and writing migration operations. Notably, the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method constructs the migration file content, but the initial analysis didn't explicitly show the inclusion of 'models' in the import statements. Deeper inspection of 'OperationWriter.serialize' and 'MigrationWriter.as_string' reveals logic to handle imports and potentially missing checks or additions to ensure 'from django.db import models' is always included. This suggests a need to review and possibly adjust these methods to ensure the import is correctly written in generated migrations.",
