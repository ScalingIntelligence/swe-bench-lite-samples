The error message indicates that 'models' is not defined in the migration file. The source of the problem is likely in the module responsible for writing migrations, which is 'django.db.migrations.writer'. It's important to focus the search on this module to identify where the import for 'models' should be included. Additionally, considering the context provided and the code snippets, the potential location for the missing import could be in the 'CreateModel' operation class within 'django.db.migrations.operations.models'.",

The search results provided contain two files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. The first file ('writer.py') is particularly relevant as it includes the 'MigrationWriter' class which is responsible for generating migration files. Within this class, the 'as_string' method constructs the migration script and handles the inclusion of necessary imports. The presence of the 'imports' section in this method indicates where the script manages the import statements. Based on the issue, it's evident that the 'models' import is missing in the generated migration, suggesting a potential oversight or bug in how 'MigrationWriter' handles imports. The second file ('models.py') defines operations related to models in migrations, but does not directly address the import issue as the 'MigrationWriter' class does in 'writer.py'. Therefore, the focus should be on the 'MigrationWriter' class and its handling of imports within the 'as_string' method in 'writer.py'.",
