Given the context provided, the issue is likely related to the module django.db.migrations.writer. The files listed include several modules from the django.db.migrations package and the models module itself. Focusing on the writer.py and operations/models.py files seems most relevant for identifying the place where the import is missing or not being inserted correctly. Additionally, considering the migration.py file could also provide insights into how migrations are structured and serialized.",

The search results contain the relevant code spans in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', specifically the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method. This method is responsible for generating the migration file and includes the part where imports are handled. The logic around adding 'from django.db import models' if it's not already present is also found in this method. Analyzing the code reveals that there is a check for the presence of 'from django.db import models' in the imports list but it only adds 'models' alongside 'migrations'. This could be the root cause of the issue. It appears that the current logic does not correctly handle the import of 'models' without also having 'migrations'. This suggests that the solution might involve adjusting the condition that checks for and adds the 'models' import to ensure it includes both 'models' and 'migrations' when needed. The search results provide sufficient context to identify and implement a fix for the reported issue. Reviewing the 'MigrationWriter' class in detail is crucial to fully understand how imports are managed and to ensure that all necessary components (like 'models' and 'migrations') are successfully included as required.",

This issue points to a potential bug in the django.db.migrations.writer module, which is responsible for generating the migration files. The search results confirm that the relevant files and code spans are indeed in the writer module, where we need to ensure that the 'migrations' and 'models' modules are properly imported when generating the migration files. The issue might be related to how the imports are managed and serialized within the `MigrationWriter` and `OperationWriter` classes. Specifically, it seems that when the `CreateModel` operation is serialized, the 'models' import might not be included if it isn't already part of the set of imports. Looking at the code, the logic for managing imports needs to ensure that 'models' is always imported if it's used, especially in the serialization process. I identified several key spans in the `MigrationWriter` and `OperationWriter` classes that deal with the serialization of operations and managing imports, which are crucial for resolving this issue. Additional inspection and possibly fixing the logic related to imports within these spans are essential.",

This could result in missing imports if the serialization of operations does not inherently cover all necessary imports. Exploring the `django.db.migrations.migration` and `django.db.migrations.operations.models` files is crucial to understand how imports are managed and if there are gaps that could lead to missing 'models' imports during migration file generation.
