This issue can be traced back to the MigrationWriter class within the django/db/migrations/writer.py file. The MigrationWriter class is responsible for generating the migration files, and the 'as_string' method within this class handles the creation of the migration file content, including the imports. The presence of the 'models' import is crucial for the migration file to be valid Python, as indicated by the NameError in the generated file. Analyzing the provided code spans in the search results, particularly the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' span, reveals that the method constructs the import statements for the migration file. The method adds imports to the 'imports' set and then sorts and adds them to the migration file content. However, it does not directly address the missing 'models' import in all cases, which could be the source of the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans involve the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method and related imports handling logic in the django/db/migrations/writer.py file.",

The issue involves a missing import statement for 'models' in the generated migration file. Reviewing the code, especially the `as_string` method in the MigrationWriter class, shows that it constructs the migration file string by aggregating imports and operations. Notably, there is a conditional block where 'from django.db import migrations, models' is added to the imports set if 'from django.db import models' is found. This suggests that the code attempts to correctly add the 'models' import if not already present. However, the error reported indicates that the import is still missing in the generated file. This implies that either the condition isn't met for some reason, or there's another part of the process that is not considering all necessary imports.

The issue seems to be related to the Django migration system, specifically how the migration files are generated. 3. I examined the given file context, focusing on 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', which is responsible for writing migration files. 4. I noticed that the 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class has logic for handling imports but does not explicitly add 'models' in all cases where it might be needed. 5. I then reviewed the new search results. In 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', there are several methods and classes related to creating, altering, and deleting model operations in migrations, all of which interact directly with 'models' from django.db. 6. The 'CreateModel' class in 'models.py' is particularly relevant, as it is likely used to generate the 'CreateModel' operation in the migration file that is causing the issue in the reported problem. 7. Back in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', within the 'as_string' method of 'MigrationWriter', it appears that the import for 'models' is conditionally added (if it's not already present), but it might not cover all necessary scenarios. 8. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans are in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' (specifically the 'as_string' method and its handling of imports) and in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' (particularly the 'CreateModel' class and its usage of 'models'). 9. These code spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue of the missing 'models' import in generated migration files.",
