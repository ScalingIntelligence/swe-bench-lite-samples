The issue specifically mentions that 'models' is not defined when creating the 'bases' tuple in the generated migration. This suggests that the module responsible for writing the migration files might not be including the required import statements. \n\nGiven the search results, the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, specifically the 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method, are critical to this process. This class is responsible for serializing operations into the migration file. However, the current code spans do not explicitly show the inclusion of an import statement for 'models'. It is plausible that this code might be generating the migration without including the import statement for 'models' from 'django.db' or possibly it's not handling the imports correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the 'django/db/migrations/__init__.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py' files provide context on the structure of migrations and operations. These are relevant as they set the stage for understanding how migrations are constructed, but they do not directly address the missing import issue. The 'django/db/migrations/state.py' and 'django/db/migrations/exceptions.py' files might also have relevant context but are not directly responsible for generating the migration files.\n\nTo fully resolve the reported issue, further investigation into the 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method, focusing on how imports are handled when generating the migration scripts, is necessary.",

This error occurs because the migration file is missing the import statement 'from django.db import models', leading to a 'NameError' when 'models' is referenced. From the provided search results, we need to identify sections of code in Django's migration writer and operations modules that might affect the generation of the migration file's imports. The primary focus should be on 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'writer.py', the 'OperationWriter' class is responsible for serializing operations, and within it, the 'serialize' method constructs the migration file's content. This method seems to handle imports and operations but does not explicitly ensure the 'models' import is included. In 'models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is used to create models in migrations but does not directly affect the import statements. Given the missing import issue, it's crucial to find where the import handling happens in the 'writer' module, particularly how imports are managed and written into the migration file to ensure 'models' is always included when needed. Currently, the code seems to manage imports but doesn't enforce the inclusion of 'models' in all necessary contexts, which could be the root cause of the issue.",
