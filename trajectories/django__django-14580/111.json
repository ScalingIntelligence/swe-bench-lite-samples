This results in a 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' when the migration is applied. The failure occurs due to the missing import statement at the top of the migration file. Given the context of the error and the files provided, it's likely that the issue lies within the django.db.migrations.writer module, specifically in the MigrationWriter class or the related processing of migrations.

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
