The error indicates that the 'models' module is not defined in the generated migration file. To resolve this, it's necessary to identify where in the Django migration generation process the import statement should be included. The module of interest is likely django.db.migrations.writer, as it is responsible for writing the migration files. Additionally, examining the model operations in django.db.migrations.operations.models might provide insights into how the 'models' module should be referenced.",

Upon analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are located within the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, particularly within the 'MigrationWriter' class. This class is responsible for generating the migration files, and the 'as_string' method handles the creation of the migration file contents, including managing imports. The key method in this class is 'as_string', which constructs the content of the migration file and should ensure all necessary imports are included. The 'OperationWriter' class also plays a crucial role in serializing the operations, which might also be relevant for ensuring that the necessary imports are correctly processed. The 'models.py' file does not directly relate to the issue but provides context on how models are defined and interact with migrations. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the missing import issue are within the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'.",
