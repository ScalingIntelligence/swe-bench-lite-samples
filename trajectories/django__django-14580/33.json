The error message indicates that 'models' is not defined, which hints at a possible bug in how Django's migration writer handles imports. Given the nature of the error, the primary focus should be on the module responsible for writing migration files, specifically 'django.db.migrations.writer'. Additionally, it's worth checking the migration operation handling in 'django.db.migrations.operations.models', as it directly interacts with model definitions. Since the error occurs when running 'makemigrations', it's also pertinent to inspect 'django.core.management.commands.makemigrations' for any code generation issues.",

The new search results contain several files and code spans related to Django's migration operations and the makemigrations command. The relevant code spans are those which define CreateModel and other model operations under django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. This includes the imports and class definitions for CreateModel which handles the creation of new models in migrations. Additionally, the Command class in django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py which manages the creation of migrations and the documentation of such actions is relevant. Notably, the MigrationWriter's functionality in writing migration files, which may include the missing import statement, is also relevant. These code spans provide the context necessary to understand how migrations are generated and potentially where the missing import might occur. Therefore, these spans are directly related to the reported issue and likely contain the necessary information to address it.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
