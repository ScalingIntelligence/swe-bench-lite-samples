The relevant code snippets point towards the migration generation logic in Django, specifically the migrations/writer.py and migrations/operations/models.py modules. To confirm and possibly fix the issue, we need to search for the exact spot in these files where the import for 'models' might be missing or improperly handled. There's also a possibility that the 'MigrationWriter' class in migrations/writer.py might be the main culprit, as it's responsible for writing migration files. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' operation in migrations/operations/models.py might also need scrutiny, particularly where it references 'models'.",

The 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file contains the MigrationWriter class, which is responsible for writing the migration files. The 'as_string' method of this class constructs the migration file content and determines the necessary imports. A crucial part of this method is where it handles imports, including 'from django.db import migrations, models'. This method ensures that the 'models' import is included when necessary. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file is relevant as it contains operations related to model changes, which are essential for generating migrations. Based on the analysis, the identified code spans focus on the 'as_string' method in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and the CreateModel class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', as they directly address the process of generating migrations and handling necessary imports.",
