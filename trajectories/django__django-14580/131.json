The provided search results include code spans from Django's migration-related modules, which need to be analyzed to identify the relevant code span(s) that might be responsible for the missing import statement.\n\n1. I will start by examining the code spans within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. This file is likely to contain the logic used to write migration files.\n2. Next, I will review the code spans from 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py'. This file is responsible for generating the migration files and might also contain relevant code.\n3. Finally, I will analyze the code spans from 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' since this file might be involved in serializing the models for migration.\n\nAfter reviewing the code spans, I will identify the most relevant ones that could be causing or contributing to the missing import statement issue.",

This is causing a NameError in the migration file where 'models' is not defined. The investigation should focus on the code sections of the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and related classes that handle the serialization and writing of migration files.\n\nFrom the provided context in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', we see the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method, which is responsible for converting migration objects into a string representation for the migration file. It appears that the 'models' import is being handled and conditionally added based on the presence of certain types of operations.\n\nThe search results confirm the presence of the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method, where it collects imports and decides whether to include 'from django.db import models'. It also includes a serialization method for operations, which is likely where the 'models' dependency should be checked and added if necessary.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the 'models' import is being conditionally added based on the presence of certain operations, but a regression or oversight might have occurred that is leading to the 'models' import being omitted in the specific case described. The relevant code sections to focus on would be the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method and the condition that checks for the 'models' import.",
