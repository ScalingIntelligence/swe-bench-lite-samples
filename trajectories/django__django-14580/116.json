Upon analyzing the `as_string` method in the `MigrationWriter` class, it becomes clear that there is logic to manage imports, but it might be missing a crucial import for 'models' in certain scenarios. To address this, the relevant code span to focus on is where imports are being added and managed (the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' span). It is essential to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is consistently added to the migration files. The current logic tries to manage imports without explicitly ensuring the 'models' import is present when needed. This discrepancy is likely the root cause of the issue.
