The 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes are responsible for generating the migration files. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method is of particular interest as it constructs the migration file and determines the necessary imports. The method does handle imports, but it does not explicitly include the 'from django.db import models' import, which would explain the missing import statement in the generated migration file. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those related to the 'MigrationWriter' class and any related import handling logic in the 'OperationWriter' class.",

A key part of this process involves handling imports, which is critical to resolving the 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' issue. The method manages imports in the 'imports' set, which is used to compile the list of necessary imports for the migration file. The code snippet indicates that 'from django.db import models' is explicitly checked and added to the imports if necessary. However, it seems that this handling might be insufficient or incorrectly implemented in certain cases, leading to missing imports in the generated migration file. To further investigate, I should focus on refining the search around the 'as_string' method and other related methods in the 'MigrationWriter' class that manipulate or use the 'imports' set.",
