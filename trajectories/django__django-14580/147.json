Additionally, it might be beneficial to review the related modules such as django.db.migrations.operations.models which directly interact with the models module during migration operations.",

The provided file context from django.db.migrations.writer.py does not directly address the missing import for 'models' in the migration file. However, the module's responsibility for writing migration files and the interaction with the 'models' module in other parts like django.db.migrations.operations.models.py suggest that the relevant code for addressing the missing import might involve this writer module. The OperationWriter and MigrationWriter classes in the writer module, as well as the serializers in django.db.migrations.serializer.py, are significant areas to check. Given the current context and the involvement of these classes in handling and writing migration operations, it's reasonable to suspect that modifications in these areas could resolve the missing import issue. However, without specific changes or additional contexts directly showing how these code segments handle or incorporate the import of 'models' in generated migrations, it's not definitive that all relevant context is covered without, for instance, reviewing the actual migration file generation process.",
