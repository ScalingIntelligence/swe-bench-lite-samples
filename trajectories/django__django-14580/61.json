This issue occurs when Django generates a migration file that uses the `models` module but fails to import it, leading to a `NameError`. By examining the provided search results, we can see that the relevant code is located in the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file. The key section to focus on is the `MigrationWriter` class, which is responsible for generating the migration files. Within this class, the `as_string` method handles the creation of the migration file content, including the imports section. Notably, the imports handling logic ensures that necessary imports are included in the generated migration file. However, the current implementation does not explicitly ensure the `models` module is added to the imports list when it's needed. This oversight is likely the reason behind the issue reported. Identifying this code span is crucial for addressing the reported bug, as it directly impacts the import handling mechanism in the migration file generation process.",
