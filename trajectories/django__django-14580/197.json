This is causing a NameError when the migration is executed. Given the problem description, it's likely that the bug may lie in the django.db.migrations.writer module, where the migration file is being generated. The error occurs when 'bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model)' is defined in the migration file, without properly importing 'models' beforehand. To address this, I'll perform a search specifically within the django.db.migrations.writer module and other related migration modules to find any place that might be omitting the import statement for 'models'. Additionally, I'll look for any occurrence of the 'bases' assignment where 'models.Model' is used to see if similar cases exist.",

This issue is likely related to how Django's migration writer module handles imports when generating migration files. After analyzing the search results for 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', it is clear that the relevant parts of the code involve the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes. These classes are responsible for serializing operations and writing the migration file, respectively. The methods 'serialize' and 'as_string' in 'MigrationWriter' are of particular interest as they handle the generation of the migration file's content, including imports. The current implementation of 'as_string' does not explicitly ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included in the list of imports, which could be why the import is missing in the generated file. Therefore, the missing import issue aligns with the functionality handled by this part of the code. To address the issue, one would likely need to modify the 'as_string' method in 'MigrationWriter' to ensure that 'models' is imported if any field directly relies on Django's 'models' module.",

The `as_string` method in `MigrationWriter` ensures that all necessary imports are included in the generated migration files. However, there is an explicit handling of the 'from django.db import models' import to ensure it is included only when needed. The logic checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the `imports` set, and if present, removes it and replaces it with 'from django.db import migrations, models' import. If not present, it adds 'from django.db import migrations' import. This ensures that the models import is included when there's a reference to 'models' but prioritizes the 'migrations' import as the standard practice for migration files. This suggests that the current logic in `MigrationWriter` is designed to handle the inclusion of 'models' import tightly scoped to when it's actually needed, to avoid unnecessarily bloating the imports section. Given this logic, the specific issue of the 'models' import being missing in the 'bases' assignment is likely due to the operation or the serialization logic not explicitly requesting the 'models' import when creating the model's base class definition.",

This file contains the key classes 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter', which are responsible for generating the migration files. The method 'OperationWriter.serialize' and 'MigrationWriter.as_string' are particularly relevant as they handle the serialization of operations and the construction of the migration file content, respectively. These methods manage the imports and their inclusion in the generated migration file. The issue indicates that the 'models' import from 'django.db' is missing, which is likely due to the logic that decides which imports to include in the migration file. This logic appears to be handled in the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method where decisions about imports are made and in the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method where the final string of the migration file is constructed. These parts of the codebase need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that the 'models' import from 'django.db' is properly included in the generated migration files.",

The `as_string` method in `MigrationWriter` ensures that necessary imports are included, specifically handling the 'from django.db import models' import. The logic is designed to include 'models' import only when actually needed to avoid unnecessary imports. The issue suggests that the 'models' import is missing in the 'bases' assignment of the generated migration file when referencing a custom model base class. This indicates that the serialization logic or operation handling might not be explicitly requesting the 'models' import for this specific case. Given the existing logic in `MigrationWriter`, the relevant code for handling imports and generating migration files is identified, but there might be specific edge cases or operations where the 'models' import is overlooked.",
