Based on the given context, it is reasonable to focus the search on the migration-related files, particularly those involved in the generation and writing of migration files. Given the stack trace and the reference to the `models` module not being defined in the migration file, it's crucial to examine the `django.db.migrations.writer` module for any potential oversights in handling the imports. The `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes are of particular interest as they are likely responsible for formatting and outputting the migration code. Furthermore, the files that define migration operations (`django.db.migrations.operations.models`) should also be checked to ensure that the operations are correctly utilizing the imports and not inadvertently omitting crucial dependencies.",
