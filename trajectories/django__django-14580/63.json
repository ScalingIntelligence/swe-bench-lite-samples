Django's makemigrations command is supposed to generate valid Python code, including all necessary import statements. The error indicates that the 'models' module is not defined, which suggests that the import statement 'from django.db import models' is missing in the generated migration file.\n\nExamining the search results from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', we find a significant portion of the code responsible for writing the migration files. Specifically, the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes are relevant, as they handle the serialization and formatting of operations and migrations, respectively. The 'serialize' method within 'OperationWriter' class processes various types of arguments and generates the corresponding Python code, including imports, for the migration operations.\n\nThe 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method is particularly relevant as it constructs the final string representation of the migration file. This method orchestrates the collection and organization of imports, dependencies, and operations, which are critical for the migration file's correctness. Notably, it distinguishes between different types of imports and ensures that 'from django.db import migrations, models' is included if 'models' are needed. This method also handles the serialization of various components of the migration file.\n\nBased on the analysis of the search results, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue with missing import statements in the generated migration files. They highlight the logic used to construct the imports section and the overall structure of the migration file, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. It's expected that any changes or fixes to address the missing import statement in generated migrations will need to be applied to or around these identified spans.",
