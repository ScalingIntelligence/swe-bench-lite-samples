The error indicates that 'models' is not defined, which suggests that the migration file generator might be failing to properly include the necessary import statements. Given the context provided, it seems relevant to search the `django.db.migrations.writer` module since this is where the migration files are presumably being written. Additionally, it's worth checking the `django.db.migrations` package as a whole to ensure there isn't a systemic issue related to handling import statements or model references.",

The new search results extend this by including the 'OperationWriter' class, which is also involved in the serialization process for migration operations. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method is relevant because it handles the serialization of operation arguments, which can include model fields and bases, potentially related to the issue. The 'OperationWriter' class also interacts with the 'MigrationWriter' class via the 'MigrationWriter.serialize' method, indicating that both classes and their methods are crucial to understand the generation of the migration file.\n\nThe identified issue with the missing import statement for 'models' directly relates to how imports are managed and serialized within these classes. The current context and search results suggest that the problem might be in handling imports when operations involving models are serialized. This is particularly relevant as the reported error occurs during the creation of the 'CreateModel' operation, which necessitates the use of 'models' from 'django.db'.

The `as_string` method constructs the migration file content, including necessary imports such as 'migrations' and optionally 'models'. It specifically checks for and includes the 'models' import if present within the operations of the migration. The logic for adding 'models' is conservative\u2014it does not automatically add it unless explicitly found within the operation content. This behavior could be why the 'models' import might be missing in some generated migration files under certain conditions. To confirm this, further investigation into how `OperationWriter` processes each operation and whether certain operations might bypass the inclusion of 'models' is warranted.",
