The MigrationWriter and OperationWriter classes are key components in this process, with the MigrationWriter.as_string method being particularly relevant as it constructs the content of the migration file. One area of interest is the imports handling in this method. According to the reported issue, the generated migration file should include 'from django.db import migrations, models' to avoid the NameError. The MigrationWriter.as_string method manages the imports for the migration file, ensuring that necessary imports are included. This method processes each operation to gather necessary imports and then ensures that 'from django.db import migrations' and potentially 'models' are included. The OperationWriter.serialize method also contributes to this process by determining what imports are needed for each operation. Additionally, the CreateModel class in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py plays a significant role in the actual creation of models during migrations, but it does not directly handle the import statements that are the crux of this issue.

However, the issue requires ensuring that when 'models' is used in generated migration files, it is imported. Given that the logic for adding imports is already present in the OperationWriter.serialize method, we should ensure that 'models' is included dynamically if used. Since the 'models' module is already being dynamically handled and added to the imports in the OperationWriter class, no additional change is needed as the current implementation already covers the required functionality.",
