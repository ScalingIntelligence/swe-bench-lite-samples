Given the context provided, it suggests that the problem is likely within the module responsible for writing migrations, which is 'django.db.migrations.writer'. The error specifically occurs in the generated migration file, indicating that the 'MigrationWriter' class might be the main focus. Additionally, the error could be linked to how the 'CreateModel' operation is processed and serialized, as it involves 'models'. Thus, searching within 'writer.py' for 'MigrationWriter' and within 'operations/models.py' for 'CreateModel' is crucial.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
