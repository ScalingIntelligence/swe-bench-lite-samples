Relevant files to investigate include those handling migration creation and serialization, such as django/db/migrations/writer.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. I will primarily focus on django/db/migrations/writer.py for its role in writing migration files and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py for potentially missing imports or incorrect handling of models during migration operations.",

The code in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is responsible for generating the migration file. Specifically, the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods are relevant, as they handle the serialization and generation of migration files. The missing import statement for 'models' likely occurs during the serialization process. The 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method are also relevant as they handle the serialization of individual operations, which might also need the import statement. In 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is relevant as it represents the operation of creating a model, which is one of the main operations in a migration file and would likely use the 'models' module.

This issue traces back to the code responsible for generating the migration file. By examining the provided search results, we can see that the relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` handle the serialization and writing of migration files. The `OperationWriter` class and `MigrationWriter` class methods serialize operations and the entire migration, respectively. Notably, the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method constructs the migration file content, including the imports. From the search results, it appears that the `MigrationWriter` class does handle imports, but there seems to be a gap in ensuring 'models' is imported correctly. The `CreateModel` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is also relevant, as it defines the creation of a model in a migration, which could potentially be where the missing import is realized. Given this analysis, the identified spans are relevant to addressing the issue, focusing on sections of the code that deal with import handling and serialization of operations and migrations.",
