The search results focus on the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, which is relevant to the migration generation process as indicated by the issue description. The file contains the `MigrationWriter` and `OperationWriter` classes, which are responsible for writing the migration files. The code spans encompass functions related to operation serialization and migration writing, which directly align with the reported issue. Notably, the `serialization_expand_args` attribute and the `serialize` method in the `OperationWriter` class handle the import statements for the operation arguments. The issue suggests that the missing import for 'models' might occur during the serialization process, where the imports for various types of arguments are managed. Given this understanding, the relevant code spans from the search results are those that pertain to the serialization and writing of migration operations, which are the areas likely responsible for the missing import. Based on the provided context and search results, the identified spans include all within the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, as they are integral to the migration generation process and closely related to the handling of import statements.",

This is crucial because the generated migration file raises a 'NameError' when 'models' is not defined. The file context provided contains the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes, which are responsible for serialization and writing operations into the migration files. The '_write' method in the 'OperationWriter' class is where arguments are written into the migration file, but it does not explicitly manage imports other than those added directly through 'MigrationWriter.serialize'. Similarly, the 'serialize' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class is involved in the serialization process but does not handle the addition of necessary imports except through registered serializers. Given these observations, the methods appear to be designed to handle object serialization and writing operations into migration files but do not explicitly add or manage 'from django.db import models' which is crucial for resolving the 'NameError'. Therefore, it seems that the file context provided does not handle the immediate solution to the issue, suggesting further code or configuration examination might be necessary to ensure all necessary imports are correctly handled and written into the migration files.",
