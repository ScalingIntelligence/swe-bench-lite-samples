This issue likely stems from the module responsible for writing the migration files, which is likely 'django.db.migrations.writer'. In the provided file context, 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' includes an 'import' statement and a 'MigrationWriter' class, which hints at its relevance. The new search results include additional relevant files: 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' and 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py'. The 'autodetector' file is likely involved in the detection and generation of migrations, including the potential oversight in importing necessary modules. The 'serializer' file, on the other hand, might have a role in serializing the data needed for the migration, which could also be impacted by the missing import statement. However, the specific spans within these files that directly address the missing import issue are not immediately evident from the provided code spans. Given the nature of the issue, a possible focus area in the 'MigrationWriter' class could be the 'serialize' or 'OperationWriter.serialize' methods, as they handle the writing and formatting of the migration file. The 'OperationWriter' class's 'serialize' method explicitly deals with serializing various arguments, suggesting it could be where the import statement should be managed correctly. Unfortunately, the detailed view of these methods in the provided spans does not highlight the handling of import statements, indicating a need for further investigation into these classes and methods. Nevertheless, these files and methods are highly likely to be pertinent for resolving the issue, requiring a more detailed examination of the operations and functions involved in the migration writing process.",
