The error 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' indicates that the 'models' module is not being imported in the generated migration file. The search results indicate that the relevant code spans are primarily in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file. Most notably, the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes are significant since they are responsible for generating the migration files. Within these classes, several methods, such as 'serialize', 'migrate', and '_write', handle the actual serialization of the migration operations into Python code. Specifically, the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method is particularly relevant as it deals with the selection of import statements and generating the migration operation lines, which should include the import statement for the 'models' module. Moreover, the 'MigrationWriter' class handles the overall creation of migration files and should also manage any necessary imports. While the provided search results currently do not explicitly show where the import statement is omitted, these are the parts of the Django migrations system that would typically handle the addition of necessary imports to the generated migration files. Importantly, the absence of a direct reference within the provided code sections that explicitly would add the import statement implies that the actual location where the import is missing would need further investigation. That missing import logic would likely need to be in a method not directly shown here in these searched code spans. Thus, recognizing the actual components responsible for generating accurate migration code in these Django modules should make the needed changes to ensure imports are properly included whenever Django generates a new migration file.",

This error typically occurs when the Django migration code generator fails to include the necessary import for 'models' from 'django.db'. By examining the provided search results, I see that the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' contains multiple spans that seem relevant to the migration writing process, particularly the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods like 'as_string' and 'serialize'. These methods are responsible for generating the migration scripts. Notably, the 'as_string' method includes logic to handle imports and serialization of various components of the migration, suggesting this section could be critical for addressing the missing import issue. Therefore, it appears that these code spans are directly related to the generation of the problematic migration file due to missing import statements, making them relevant to the issue reported.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
