The search results focus on `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, which is a likely candidate for the source of this bug since it is responsible for writing migration files. Specifically, the code spans detailing the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes are particularly relevant, as they handle serialization and constructing migration files. The `MigrationWriter.as_string` method should ensure all necessary imports are included. Currently, it seems to handle most imports but may not be adding imports for 'models' when required. Digging deeper into this method and its handling of imports could potentially reveal why 'models' is missing. Additionally, examining the `OperationWriter.serialize` and `MigrationWriter.serialize` methods might shed light on how fields and models are being processed and whether 'models' is inadvertently left out during serialization.",

Given the context provided, the 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for composing the content of the migration file. The method constructs the import statements and the body of the migration class. Notably, the imports are processed and sorted, which could potentially omit the necessary import for 'models' if not handled correctly. For instance, the current logic adds 'from django.db import migrations' but does not explicitly add 'from django.db import models', unless it detects a direct usage that has been removed during the generation process. This oversight might be causing the error. Therefore, investigating and ensuring that 'from django.db import models' is always included when required should resolve the issue.",

In the provided file context and search results, we see the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', which is crucial for the generation of migration files. This class has a method 'as_string' that constructs the migration file content. The method iterates over 'self.migration.operations' and serializes each operation using 'OperationWriter'. Within 'as_string', there's a critical section where imports are managed. If 'from django.db import models' is in the imports set, it's supposed to be replaced with 'from django.db import migrations, models'. However, it seems like there might be a logic issue if this condition is not met, 'models' would not be imported. This code snippet is likely relevant to the issue because it directly handles the generation of the migration file, including managing the imports. This core functionality aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the reported issue.",
