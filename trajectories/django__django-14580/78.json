In 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for generating the migration file content.

The current logic attempts to add 'from django.db import migrations' and 'from django.db import models' if not already present, but it lacks handling for 'models' when it's not in the imports set. This oversight is a possible culprit for the missing import statement in the generated migration file. Additionally, 'models.py' contains operations related to model changes, which indirectly affect the migration file generation in 'writer.py' but are directly related to the reported issue due to their usage within the migrations. The identified span in 'writer.py' (id='MigrationWriter.as_string') is crucial as it directly influences the content of the migration file, including the imports section.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue relates to a missing import statement in the generated migration file where 'models' is not defined. This suggests a problem in the migration writing process. Examining the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', we find the method 'as_string', which is responsible for generating the migration file. It processes the imports and includes them at the top of the generated file. This method should include an import for 'from django.db import models', which is missing based on the error. From the search results, we identified the main code track that could be responsible for the migration file generation and the handling of imports.\n\nThe identified code spans in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' are directly relevant to the migration writing process, including the handling of imports, which are managed by 'MigrationWriter.as_string' and 'MigrationWriter.serialize'. These are critical methods for processing and formatting the migration file properly.\n\nA further check in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' shows the operations that directly involve models, such as creating, altering, and handling the migrations of models. The '__init__' method of the 'CreateModel' class in particular is responsible for constructing the model operations during migration generation. These sections are pertinent to understanding how the model operations are serialized into the migration files.\n\nDiscrepancies in how these code parts interact or how imports are managed could lead to the bug where the import statement for 'models' is not included in the generated migrations, as seen in the reported issue.\n\nWhile the search results reveal significant code tracks, including the 'MigrationWriter' class and model operation handling, further refinement could outline the exact part of the codebase where the import failure happens or where additional logic could prevent the omission of such imports, resolving the reported issue.",

The 'models' import is controlled by the presence of 'if \"from django.db import models\" in imports' in the 'as_string' method. If the 'models' import is detected, it's re-added correctly. However, if it's not initially present, it likely won't be added, even if necessary.
