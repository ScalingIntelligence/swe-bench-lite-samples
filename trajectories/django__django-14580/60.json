The error occurs because the 'models' module is not imported in the migration file, leading to a 'NameError'. The likely source of the bug could be in the MigrationWriter class within the django.db.migrations.writer module, which is responsible for generating the migration files. It's also possible that the ModelOperation class in the django.db.migrations.operations.models module might be relevant, as it directly deals with model-related operations in migrations. Focus on these classes to find where the import statement might be missing or not handled correctly.",

This leads to a NameError when the 'models' module is referenced in the migration file. The issue is likely related to the module django.db.migrations.writer, as this is responsible for writing migration files. The provided search results include relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for generating migration files, and it already includes logic to manage imports, including 'from django.db import models'. However, it seems to handle the import in a way that could potentially miss adding it when needed. For instance, in the 'as_string' method, the logic to add 'from django.db import models' if not already present seems conditional and might not cover all scenarios. The 'CreateModel' class in 'models.py' is also relevant as it is responsible for creating model migrations, which are integral parts of the migration files. The identified code spans provide a good starting point for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",
