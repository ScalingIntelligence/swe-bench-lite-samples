The main concern is that the migration file does not include the necessary import statement 'from django.db import migrations, models', leading to a 'NameError'. This issue is clearly tied to the way Django's MigrationWriter class generates the migration file. By examining the code provided in the <search_results>, we can see the as_string method of the MigrationWriter class. This method is responsible for assembling the migration file content, including the necessary imports. The relevant part of the method deals with handling imports for the migration file. It adds necessary imports from the self.migration.operations and self.migration.dependencies. However, a specific check is in place to ensure 'from django.db import models' is always included if 'from django.db import migrations' is present, which might be the crux of the issue. The provided snippets confirm that the import handling logic in MigrationWriter.as_string might be the cause of the bug reported. Hence, the identified span 'MigrationWriter.as_string' in the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is crucial for further investigation and potential fixes to address the reported issue.",
