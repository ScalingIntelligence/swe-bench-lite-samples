This suggests that the problem might be in the part of the Django code responsible for writing migration files. From the provided file context, 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' appear to be the most relevant files concerning migration operations and their generation. The specific error indicates that the 'models' module is not being imported where it's expected, so the search should focus on these files and particularly on the code that handles the creation and serialization of model operations in migrations.",

This error is due to the migration file not including an import statement for 'models' from 'django.db', which is required for the migration to be valid Python code. The search results provide a deep dive into the Django migration file generation process, particularly in the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file. Here, the `MigrationWriter` class is responsible for creating the migration files. Key functions include `as_string` which constructs the migration file content, and `serialize` which handles serialization of different migration elements. The `OperationWriter` class, also in `writer.py`, plays a crucial role in serializing individual operations within the migration. Given the issue, looking into how `MigrationWriter` constructs the imports section of the migration file is essential. The search results do not directly show the missing import statement being added, but they shed light on the process and where a potential fix could be implemented. The additional file, `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, while not directly related to the missing import issue, provides context on model operations within migrations, which could be helpful for a broader understanding of migration creation. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans focus on how imports are managed and serialized during the migration file creation process.",

The relevant file is django/db/migrations/writer.py, which is responsible for generating migration files. The migration generation process involves serializing the operations and possibly missing necessary imports like 'models'. I believe the issue might be in the OperationWriter.serialize method where imports are collected but not properly checked and added if missing. I propose to update the existing logic in the OperationWriter.serialize method to ensure that 'models' and other necessary imports are added if the operation references any models related entities.",
