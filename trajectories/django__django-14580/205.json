This results in a `NameError: name 'models' is not defined` when attempting to run the migration. The issue seems to be related to the module `django.db.migrations.writer`. Analyzing the provided search results, particularly the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, reveals critical functions and methods within the `MigrationWriter` class that handle the generation of migration files. Notably, the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method processes and prepares the migration file content, including handling imports. The method currently checks if `from django.db import models` is in the imports and adjusts it to `from django.db import migrations, models` if necessary, which suggests that the import handling logic might be flawed or insufficient to cover all cases. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the missing import issue would be within the `MigrationWriter` class, specifically the `as_string` method, where the import statements are managed and generated.",
