The search results indicate the presence of the 'MigrationWriter' class within the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, which is responsible for generating migration files. Among the code spans, 'MigrationWriter.as_string' is of particular interest as it contains the logic for assembling the contents of a migration file, including imports. This method manages the set of imports and ensures that 'from django.db import migrations' is always included, but it lacks a direct addition of 'models' under the same import statement. This omission is likely the root cause of the issue. Identifying and including the 'models' import within this method should resolve the reported problem. The relevant code spans from 'MigrationWriter.as_string' would need to be modified to include 'models' alongside 'migrations' if not already present among the managed imports.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
