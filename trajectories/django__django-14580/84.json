The 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is responsible for writing the migration files. Within this class, the 'as_string' method handles the generation of the migration file content, including the handling of imports. The method adds 'from django.db import migrations' if 'from django.db import models' is not already in the imports, which does not cover the case where 'models' should also be imported. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is heavily involved in defining new models during migrations, making it relevant to the issue as it interacts closely with the 'models' module. The identified code spans within 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' are directly related to the generation and definition of models during migrations, which aligns with the reported issue.
