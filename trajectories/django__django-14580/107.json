This issue is likely related to the migration writing process in the Django codebase. \n\nIn the provided search results, we can find relevant code spans in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file. This file contains the `MigrationWriter` class, which is responsible for writing migration files. However, while there are import statements for various modules, including 'from django.db import migrations', there isn't an explicit import for 'models'. This could explain why the migration file generated misses the 'models' import. \n\nAdditionally, the `CreateModel` class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is also relevant as it defines operations for creating models during migrations. This class interacts directly with 'models', which should ideally be imported. \n\nTo address the issue, we need to identify if there's a missing import statement for 'models' in both files. Based on the analysis, it appears that while import statements exist for other related functionalities like migrations, the explicit import for 'models' might indeed be missing, which could be causing the reported issue.",

This issue is likely to be within the django.db.migrations module. I have analyzed the provided search results and the context to identify any relevant code that addresses or is likely to be part of the solution to this issue. I focused on examining the django/db/migrations/writer.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py files, as they are directly related to migration operations and their generation. The django/db/migrations/writer.py file includes import statements for the 'models' module among others, which is a strong indication that this file could be where the logic for generating migration files resides or influences. Additionally, the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file contains a class definition for 'CreateModel', which is intricately linked to the creation of model-related migrations. This file also includes the relevant import for 'models'. These pieces of code are likely to be directly related to the missing import issue. Further, the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file contains methods like 'CreateModel.state_forwards' and 'CreateModel.database_forwards', which deal with the application of model changes to the database state, making it critical for understanding how migrations are handled and generated. Thus, weighting the relevance and proximity to the issue, these files and code sections are highly relevant to the reported issue of missing imports in the migration file.",

Specifically, the 'CreateModel' operation in 'models.py' is involved in defining the structure of the migration file where fields, options, bases, and managers are specified. The error indicates that despite referencing 'models.Model', the import statement is absent. This suggests a potential oversight or an incomplete handling of imports during the final composition of the migration file.

Upon reviewing the search results, I focused on the django/db/migrations/writer.py file because this file is responsible for writing the migration files. I analyzed the MigrationWriter class and its methods to see if there is any code that handles the import statements for the migration files. The method MigrationWriter.as_string stands out as it constructs the migration script, including the import statements. It includes a section where it checks for the presence of 'from django.db import models' and modifies the imports set accordingly. This method is crucial for ensuring all necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models', are included in the generated migration script. Therefore, the identified relevant spans are those within the MigrationWriter.as_string method as they directly deal with the construction and inclusion of necessary imports in the migration files.",
