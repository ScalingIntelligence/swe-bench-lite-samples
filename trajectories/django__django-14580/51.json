            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves Django's migration generation missing an import statement for the 'models' module. This leads to a 'NameError' when the generated migration file is executed. The error suggests that the migration file lacks the necessary import statement for 'models', which should typically be included during the migration file generation process. The relevant module to investigate is likely 'django.db.migrations.writer', specifically focusing on the 'MigrationWriter' class. Additional relevant modules may include 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' and 'django.db.migrations.serializer', as they handle model operations and serialization which could be related to the missing import. The search should focus on code snippets or patterns related to generating migration files, specifically looking for where and how the 'models' import is handled (or should be handled).",
