The provided search results expose the code in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', specifically focusing on the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods. This class is crucial for generating migration files and their contents. Key aspects like 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, which constructs the migration file, and the 'OperationWriter' class, which manages the serialization of individual operations, are observed. The serialization process explicitly handles imports by collecting them from various sources and organizing them appropriately. However, a crucial point is the manner in which the imports are finalized, which doesn't seem to include 'from django.db import models' if not already present. This could potentially explain the missing import statement, which is leading to the error. The identified code spans ('MigrationWriter.as_string' and neighboring methods) are directly related to the generation of migration files and directly address the core of the issue as it pertains to the import statement of 'models'.
