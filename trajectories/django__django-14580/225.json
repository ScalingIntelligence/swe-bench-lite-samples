The content of the migration file generated by Django lacks the necessary import statement for 'models', leading to a NameError. The provided search results include relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' which contain crucial methods and classes related to model operations and migration creation. Specifically, the 'CreateModel' class and its methods like '__init__', 'deconstruct', 'state_forwards', 'database_forwards', 'database_backwards', 'describe', 'migration_name_fragment', 'references_model', and 'reduce' are likely involved in generating migration files and handling model changes. The initial import statement in the file is significant because it imports the 'models' module from 'django.db', which is the missing import causing the issue. Notably, the '__init__' method of 'CreateModel' class directly specifies 'models.Model' as a default base class, suggesting that this part of the code is directly related to the missing import issue in the migration file, which is clearly a key area of focus for resolving the reported issue. Therefore, these sections of the code are highly relevant to resolving the missing import issue in the generated migration files.",

This causes a 'NameError' when the migration file is executed because 'models' is not defined. The primary focus is on the migration generation process in Django's migration module. The current file context and search results show relevant parts of the code in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' and 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. The 'CreateModel' class in 'models.py' is responsible for defining the operations to create models in the database, and it involves 'models' import which is crucial for the functionality. In the 'writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for writing out the migration files as strings. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string()' method is particularly relevant as it constructs the migration script, including the import statements. The missing 'models' import in the generated migration file suggests that the logic in 'MigrationWriter.as_string()' might not be handling the 'models' import correctly. Given the context and the search results, the identified spans include the 'MigrationWriter' class and its method 'as_string()' from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', which are critical for ensuring that the imports are correctly handled when generating a migration file.",

The 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods such as 'as_string' and 'serialize' are critical as they format and output the content of the migration file.
