The provided search results include the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes, which are critical for understanding how operations and migrations are serialized into the migration files. The `OperationWriter.serialize` and `MigrationWriter.as_string` methods are particularly relevant, as they contain logic for handling the serialization of operations and overall migration files, respectively.

However, the provided code shows that while the code checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports, it doesn't seem to add it if it's not present, which could be the root cause of the issue.
