This suggests that the code responsible for generating the migration file might be omitting necessary imports. The steps to resolve this would involve investigating the MigrationWriter class and related operations in the django.db.migrations module, focusing on the parts that handle the serialization and writing of model operations into the migration file. It's also important to check the model operations themselves to ensure they are correctly referenced and imported.",

This issue is related to Django's migration writer and the handling of model imports during the migration process. The provided search results include relevant files and code spans that might address this issue.\n\n1. 'django/db/migrations/writer.py': This file contains the definition of the `MigrationWriter` class, which is responsible for generating migration files. The `as_string` method within this class is of particular interest as it constructs the migration file's content and manages the relevant imports.\n\n2. 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py': This file contains the operations for handling model-related changes in migrations. It includes the `CreateModel` class, which is used to create a new model in the migration. Understanding how the `CreateModel` operation constructs its content, including its handling of field definitions and class bases, is crucial for identifying where imports might be missing.\n\nBased on the relevance to the issue, the key spans to focus on are within the `MigrationWriter`'s `as_string` method and the `CreateModel` class's initialization and construction methods.\n\nThe spans identified as relevant are:\n- 'imports': Contains the import statements necessary for the migration file.\n- 'MigrationWriter.as_string': Responsible for generating the migration file's content.\n- 'CreateModel.__init__': Initializes the creation of a new model in a migration.\n- 'CreateModel.deconstruct': Deconstructs the model to help in generating the migration's content.",

The MigrationWriter class is responsible for generating the migration file contents, and the CreateModel operation is directly related to the creation of model operations in a migration. The issue description indicates that the 'models' import is missing in the generated migration file, which could be due to the way imports are handled in the MigrationWriter class. Specifically, the code checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and adjusts it accordingly, but it might still miss specifically adding this required import if it's not already included in another form. This suggests a potential point of investigation within the MigrationWriter's 'as_string' method.

The MigrationWriter class in the first file shows how migrations are written and how imports are managed. Although the 'models' import is handled within the MigrationWriter's 'as_string' method, there's a specific logic in place to ensure this import is included. The second file provides the model operations including CreateModel, which might need the 'models' import to function correctly. Given the context, it seems that the codebase attempts to manage this import but might fail under certain conditions, which matches the reported issue. However, since the exact conditions for failure aren't detailed here and the exact code causing the issue isn't present in the file context, it's hard to confirm the completeness of the relevant file context without further investigation.",
