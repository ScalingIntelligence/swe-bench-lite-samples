The stack trace provided during the error suggests that the problem originates from how Django's migration writer handles the creation of migration files. The focus should specifically be on django.db.migrations.writer where the MigrationWriter class and its methods are defined, as well as django.db.migrations.operations.models where interactions with models occur. Given the information, two precise search parameters are justified: 1) the direct error message focusing on the `NameError: name 'models' is not defined` to pinpoint error handling or import misses in the context of migrations, and 2) a direct search for the method or operation that writes the migration files like 'CreateModel' operation since it directly involves writing model definitions which could be missing an import.",

The search results provided contain relevant sections from the Django codebase, particularly from the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' files. These files are critical as they handle the serialization and creation of migration operations. The key sections to focus on are those that deal with the serialization and generation of migration files, as well as the creation of model operations. Specifically, the 'MigrationWriter' class and its 'as_string' method are crucial for understanding how the migration files are constructed. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' operation within the 'models.py' file is relevant as it details how model operations are defined and executed. By examining these sections, we can identify the areas where the import statement for 'models' might be missing or incorrectly handled.",
