The search results provided include a detailed look into the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which is crucial for understanding how migration files are created. Specifically, the `MigrationWriter` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `as_string`, `basedir`, `filename`, `path`, `serialize`, `register_serializer`, and `unregister_serializer` are analyzed. The methods within the `OperationWriter` class, such as `__init__`, `serialize`, and `feed`, are also examined since they contribute to the serialization process of the migration operations. The key part to focus on is the `as_string` method in the `MigrationWriter` class, which constructs the migration file content, including imports. The analysis shows that while the method includes handling for other imports, it lacks explicit handling for the 'from django.db import models' import, which is likely causing the issue. The relevant code spans identified from the search results are those that pertain to the serialization and creation of the migration file content, especially where the imports are managed and written into the file. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue at hand.",

Upon analyzing the provided search results, I've identified that the relevant code spans are within the MigrationWriter class in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file. Specifically, the as_string method is responsible for generating the content of the migration file, and within this method, there is a condition that adds the import statement for 'models' if it's present in the imports. The bug seems to arise from the logic that handles the addition of import statements, particularly where it checks if 'from django.db import models' is already present.

I will focus on identifying the relevant code spans within this file that deal with the import handling and migration generation, particularly where imports might be added, removed, or checked.\n\n1. **Imports Handling**: The 'imports' section contains the initial imports used in the migration writer module. This is a good starting point to understand the context in which the migration files are generated.\n2. **OperationWriter.serialize**: This method is responsible for serializing individual operations within a migration, generating Python code for each. It is important to ensure that the import statements, including 'from django.db import models', are managed correctly here.\n3. **MigrationWriter.as_string**: This method constructs the entire migration file as a string, including imports. The handling of import statements in this method is crucial as this is where the final import block for the migration file is determined.\n\nGiven these points, the code spans that need to be identified must address the proper management and inclusion of the 'from django.db import models' import in the serialized migration output to prevent the 'NameError' reported.",
