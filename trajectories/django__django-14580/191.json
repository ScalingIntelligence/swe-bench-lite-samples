This suggests a problem in the Django migration generation process. The relevant files to inspect are those related to migration writing and model operations, specifically those operating directly on the 'models' module. The MigrationWriter and OperationWriter classes in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' as well as the CreateModel class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' are likely culprits. Additionally, checking how the 'models' import is managed in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' might shed light on the issue.",

This leads to a NameError when the migration is executed. The search results provided cover various aspects of the Django migration process, including the operations, state management, and writer components. It's crucial to identify the part of the code responsible for generating the migration files to determine where the import statement might be missing.\n\n1. **django/db/migrations/writer.py** contains the `OperationWriter` class, which is responsible for serializing operations into migration files. The spans in this file are relevant as they deal with the writing and serialization of migration operations.\n2. **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py** includes the `CreateModel` operation, which is likely related to the creation of the problematic migration file. The spans in this file are relevant as they define how to create model-related operations.\n3. **django/db/migrations/serializer.py** deals with the serialization of various types, including models and operations. The spans in this file are relevant as they ensure that objects are properly serialized into the migration files.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the spans in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, and `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` are identified as relevant to the issue because they directly involve the creation and serialization of migration files.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant spans are from the files involving migration writing and serialization, which are linked to the reported issue of missing import statements in the generated migration files.",

This causes a 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' error when the migration file is executed. To resolve this, we need to identify the part of the Django codebase that generates the migration files and ensure that the 'models' import is included in the generated migration file. From the provided search results, the most relevant file is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', as it contains the 'MigrationWriter' class responsible for writing migration files. However, the 'imports' span in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' does not currently include the 'from django.db import models' import. We need to ensure that any code that generates migration files includes this import. The 'migrate' command uses the 'MigrationAutodetector' and 'MigrationWriter' classes to generate migration files based on changes detected in the models. Therefore, we should check if the 'MigrationWriter' class or any related utility functions properly serialize model operations and include necessary imports. Furthermore, the 'serializer_factory' function in 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' is crucial for serializing various components of a migration, including model definitions. This function needs to ensure that when serializing model operations, the necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models', are included in the generated migration file. Since these code spans were found in the provided search results, they are relevant and should be considered for further examination or modification to ensure that the 'models' import is included in the generated migration files.",
