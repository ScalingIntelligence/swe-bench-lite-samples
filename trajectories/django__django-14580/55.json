Interestingly, there's a specific handling for 'from django.db import models', where if it's found in the imports set, it's replaced with 'from django.db import migrations, models'. This ensures that the migrations module is always imported alongside models, which suggests that the system is designed to always include the models module when writing migration files. However, the logic for ensuring 'models' is available for each operation is not explicitly shown in this section. It's possible that this handling depends on the individual OperationWriter class, which serializes each operation.

It's possible that within `serialize()`, there is specific handling for 'models' to ensure that whenever an operation related to models is serialized, the `models` module is included. Given that the `MigrationWriter.as_string()` method already includes a snippet that specifically handles importing 'models' when found in the imports set, by adding 'migrations' alongside it, there's an established pattern for ensuring the presence of Django's database models.

In the 'as_string' method of the 'MigrationWriter' class, there's a section that handles the addition of imports. The code initially checks if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports set and adjusts it accordingly. However, if it's not found, it only adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This logic seems to be the cause of the bug, as it doesn't ensure 'models' is always imported when needed. To resolve this, the code should unconditionally add 'from django.db import migrations, models' to the imports set, ensuring the 'models' module is always available in the generated migration file. This analysis is based on the assumption that any operations in the migration might require the 'models' module, and thus it should be imported by default to prevent such errors.",
