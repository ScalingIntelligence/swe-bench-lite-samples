The issue still points to an error in the migration file generation due to a missing import statement for 'models'. Given that the migration process involves multiple components, including the `makemigrations` command, the `MigrationWriter`, and the `CreateModel` operation, it's possible that the import statement for 'models' could be missing from any of these components or their dependencies. Therefore, expanding the search to include any files related to migration operations or model creation could help uncover the problem. Specifically, looking at files that deal with the generation of migration scripts or the handling of model operations might reveal where the import statement is absent or incorrectly integrated.",

The new search results provide additional context in the writer module, which is responsible for serializing migration operations and generating the migration files. The 'CreateModel' operation is particularly relevant as it defines how new models are created in migrations. The 'MigrationWriter' class in the writer module is critical for generating the actual migration file content.\n\nTo address the issue, the analysis should focus on the 'CreateModel' operation and how it's serialized into the migration file. The 'deconstruct' method in 'CreateModel' is responsible for breaking down the operation into its essential components, and the 'serialize' method in 'MigrationWriter' handles the conversion of these components into Python code. Specifically, the 'bases' attribute in 'CreateModel' must ensure that the 'models.Model' base class is correctly referenced, which is crucial for avoiding the 'NameError' related to 'models' not being defined.\n\nThe identified spans in the search results include the module where the serialization logic resides, which is crucial for understanding how the import statements are handled during the generation of migration files.

The `CreateModel` operation's method of adding fields and resolving relations, as suggested in the issue description, is a critical area where the missing import might occur due to inadequate marshalling of imports or omissions in the serialization process. The `autodetector.py` which detects changes in models and the `operations` module, where various migration operations like `CreateModel` and `AddField` are defined, are also relevant. Despite the in-depth examination, direct code handling or management of import statements for 'models' specific to this reported issue is not mentioned explicitly.

The best place to add the new method is between the existing 'serialize' and 'indent' methods to maintain logical order and readability.",
