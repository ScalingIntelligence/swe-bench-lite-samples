Specifically, the error 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined' indicates that the 'models' module is not being imported in the generated migration files. The search should focus on the django.db.migrations module, particularly the 'writer.py' file, as it is responsible for writing migration files. Additionally, the 'operations/models.py' file might also be relevant as it deals with model operations during migrations. Since the error is related to the absence of an import statement, the search should specifically look for instances where 'models' should be imported but are not.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
