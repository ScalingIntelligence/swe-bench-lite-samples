Based on the provided context, the issue seems to be related to how Django's migration files are being generated and written.

However, the issue could also be related to the `CreateModel` operation in the `django.db.migrations.operations.models` module. To pinpoint the exact location of the bug, two search requests should be made: one targeting the `MigrationWriter` class in the writer module and another focusing on the `CreateModel` operation in the models module.",

The initial examination of the search results reveals a potential location in the code where the import handling might be happening. The MigrationWriter class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' processes the imports and generates the migration file. Specifically, the 'as_string' method in this class handles the addition of imports, including checking for the presence of 'from django.db import models'. If this import is found, it ensures that 'models' is imported alongside 'migrations'. This part of the code appears directly relevant to the reported issue, as it deals with ensuring the required import statements are included in the generated migration files. Further, the 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is relevant because it constructs the model creation operation within the migration, which is central to the issue of missing 'models' import. These two sections of code are significant as they directly relate to the generation and structure of the migration files, where the missing import issue arises.",

This migration file uses the Django models module, which is not being imported properly in the migration script. This leads to a NameError because 'models' is not defined. The relevant code span is identified in the OperationWriter.serialize method in the django/db/migrations/writer.py file. This method handles the serialization of migration operations and is responsible for generating the migration file. The identified span in OperationWriter.serialize represents the function handling the import statements for the migration operations. This is relevant because the issue at hand is precisely about ensuring that all necessary imports, including the 'models' module, are present in the migration file to avoid NameError. This suggests that the missing 'models' import statement might be due to an oversight in the handling of imports within the OperationWriter class. This is a crucial piece of code to examine further to determine why the 'models' import is not being added or retained in the final generated migration file. Additionally, the context around this method should be reviewed to ensure there are no other contributing factors leading to the missing import.

Specifically, the OperationWriter and MigrationWriter classes and their methods (like serialize and as_string) are pertinent to this issue, as they handle the serialization of operations into the migration file. In the new search results, there are additional files and spans that are relevant, such as 'django/db/migrations/state.py', 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', and 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', which also deal with various aspects of migrations, including state management, recording, and auto-detection of changes. The 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' file is also critical as it handles the serialization of various data types into strings that can be written into the migration files. The relevance of these files is due to their involvement in the process of generating migration files, which is directly related to the issue at hand. These files and their functions provide the necessary context and functionality to address the missing import statement in the generated migration files. The identified spans provide insights into how the migration process, specifically the serialization and writing of these migrations, is handled within Django's codebase.

The `serialize` method of `OperationWriter` ensures that all necessary imports are collected and written into the migration file.

Specifically, update the 'as_string' method within the MigrationWriter class to ensure that 'from django.db import migrations, models' is included in the imports when model classes are referenced. This change should only be applied if any model-related operations require an import of the 'models' module.\n\nThe task requires adding a models import if model-related operations are present. The relevant code block checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and adjusts it to 'from django.db import migrations, models'. This should only happen if the 'models' module is actually needed, which is inferred by its presence in the imports.",
