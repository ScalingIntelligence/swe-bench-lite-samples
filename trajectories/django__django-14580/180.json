The search results from the django/db/migrations/writer.py file contain a class named MigrationWriter and its methods that handle the serialization and writing of migration files. The MigrationWriter.as_string method is particularly relevant as it constructs the migration file's content, including imports. Notably, there's a comment in the import handling section about the need for manual porting if specific imports are found. However, the issue indicates that 'from django.db import models' is not being included in the migration file. This suggests that the logic in the MigrationWriter class or its related methods might not be handling the import of 'models' correctly. The relevant code spans that are deemed important are the ones involving the import handling and the generation of the migration file content, particularly where it involves the 'models' module. These include the 'MigrationWriter.as_string', 'OperationWriter.serialize', and the imports section where the addition of 'import models' or ensuring 'from django.db import migrations, models' is in place should be checked. It's crucial to ensure that when the migration file is generated, all necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models', are properly handled to prevent runtime errors.",

However, a check through the file context reveals that even though `from django.db import migrations` is added, there is no direct inclusion of `from django.db import models` in the imports section when it's missing. This omission matches the reported issue's description of the missing import statement. Additionally, the `OperationWriter` class's `serialize` method shows an intent to add `migrations, models` if the `models` import is missing, but the actual implementation shows it only adds `migrations` without `models`.
