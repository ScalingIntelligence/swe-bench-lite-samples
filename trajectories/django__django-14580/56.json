The provided search results point to two relevant files: `django/db/migrations/writer.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. In `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, the `MigrationWriter` class and its methods, particularly `as_string`, handle the generation of migration files. The method ensures that the necessary imports are included, but there seems to be a logic error where it fails to consistently add `models` from `django.db`. On the other hand, `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` deals with model operations during migrations but does not directly address the import issue reported. The main focus should be on fixing the import logic in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` to ensure `models` is always imported. The identified span 'MigrationWriter.as_string' is crucial as it constructs the migration file, and the issue lies within how imports are handled in this method.",
