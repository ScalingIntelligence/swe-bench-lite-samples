The error occurs in the migration file itself, specifically referencing the 'models' module. Since the issue is related to the generation of migration files, the area of interest would be the migration writer module. Investigating the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module, particularly the 'MigrationWriter' class and associated functions, would be the first step to understand how the migration files are generated and ensure that necessary imports are included. Additionally, reviewing the 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' module could provide insights into how model operations are handled during migration generation.",

The search results provided focus on the 'MigrationWriter' class within Django's migration writer module.

This method handles the collection of necessary imports but does not explicitly add an import for 'models' if it's not already present in the imports set. This omission aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are from the 'MigrationWriter' class, specifically focusing on the method 'as_string' which controls the generation of the migration file's content, including its imports. The key sections are those that construct the imports set and ensure it includes necessary modules like 'django.db.migrations' and 'django.db.models'.

This suggests that the code responsible for generating the migration files is not properly including the necessary imports. Upon reviewing the provided file context from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', it's clear that the file is involved in writing migration files. Specifically, the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method handles the construction of the migration file content including the imports. The code checks if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports set and adjusts accordingly, but it seems this might not be sufficient if 'models' is not initially added. The search results confirm the presence of this method which is crucial as it determines the imports that will be included in the migration file.
