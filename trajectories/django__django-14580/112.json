To address this, I will focus on the 'writer' part of the migration process, specifically the MigrationWriter class in django/db/migrations/writer.py, as this is where migrations are generated and written to files. The 'imports' span in django/db/migrations/writer.py shows the current import statements at the top of the file. I will closely examine the methods of MigrationWriter, especially the constructor (__init__) and other methods that might be responsible for composing the migration file content. The search results do not directly show the specific method responsible for generating the text of the migrations, so I have marked all spans related to MigrationWriter as potentially relevant. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the 'imports' span shows that 'models' is imported correctly, which suggests that the issue might not be directly related to the recorder part of the migration process. Therefore, I will not consider the parts of that file as relevant except for the general understanding that 'models' are correctly being imported elsewhere in Django's migration system.",
