To address this, we need to identify the part of the Django migration system responsible for writing the migration files. Given the stack trace and the error message, the focus should be on the django.db.migrations.writer module, specifically the MigrationWriter class and its related methods. Additionally, it's worth checking the django.db.migrations.operations.models module where the CreateModel class is defined, as this class directly interacts with model definitions during migration creation. The search should be directed towards these modules to pinpoint where the import statement might be missing or wrongly handled.",

The error specifically mentions 'NameError: name 'models' is not defined,' which indicates that the 'models' module was not imported in the migration file where it was referenced. This points to the need to investigate the code responsible for generating migration files in Django, specifically focusing on the 'django.db.migrations.writer' module as hinted by the user. \n\nIn the provided search results, the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file contains the 'MigrationWriter' class, which is responsible for writing migration files. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method is of particular interest because it constructs the string representation of the migration file, including the necessary imports. The method contains logic to manage imports, including handling the 'from django.db import models' import specifically. It checks if this import is present and adjusts it accordingly. This section of the code should be examined closely to ensure that it correctly handles the import of the 'models' module. \n\nThe second file provided, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', also includes relevant code spans, particularly the 'CreateModel' class which is used to create new models in migrations. Although this file is less directly related to the import issue, it is relevant as it demonstrates how model operations are handled in migrations and might be useful for understanding the broader context of migration generation. \n\nBased on the analysis, both 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' are relevant to the reported issue. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method in the 'writer' module should be the primary focus for addressing the missing import statement issue. Other parts of the 'writer' module and the 'models' operations module also provide context that could be useful for a comprehensive understanding and potential resolution of the issue.",

The context and search results both point to the 'MigrationWriter' class in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file as the primary suspect for the missing import. The 'as_string' method of this class is responsible for constructing the string representation of the migration file, including the imports. Within this method, the logic for handling imports is crucial. The relevant spans to focus on are those that update or modify the 'imports' set, which is used to generate the import section of the migration file. Specifically, I should look at how the 'from django.db import models' import is managed or omitted. Additionally, the 'CreateModel' class in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file is also relevant because it constructs the operations section of the migration file, though it does not directly handle imports.

Given the context and search results, the focus is on identifying the code responsible for generating the migration file and ensuring that the necessary imports are included.\n\nThe main areas of interest are:\n1. The `MigrationWriter` class in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` which is responsible for writing the migration file.\n2. The `CreateModel` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` which is involved in creating the model structure within the migration.\n\nFrom the `file_context` and `search_results`, the critical code span is within the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class. This method is responsible for constructing the string representation of the migration file, including the imports section. The issue likely arises from the handling of imports in this method, specifically around the conditional check for 'from django.db import models'. The relevant spans are:\n- The imports section where 'from django.db import models' is conditionally added.\n- The operations section where the 'bases' parameter of the 'CreateModel' operation is processed.\n\nThese code spans are crucial to understand how the migration file is generated and to identify where the missing import might be occurring. The `CreateModel` class initialization and deconstruction methods are also relevant to understand the model creation process within the migration.",
