Given the error message and the stack trace, the problem seems to be related to how Django generates the migration files, specifically within the django.db.migrations.writer module. The MigrationWriter class in this module is responsible for serializing the migration operations into a file. The first search will focus on the writer.py file, specifically looking for the MigrationWriter class and any related methods that might involve writing the import statements for models. The second search will look into the models.py that was provided as an example, to understand if the issue lies in how the model classes are defined or not. The third search will be broader, involving all files relevant to migrations to ensure no missed spots, using a general query to make sure no important details are overlooked.",

This issue arises when the migration file is generated and causes a 'NameError' because 'models' is not defined. The analysis of the search results must focus on understanding how the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes handle the serialization of operations and imports. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method is particularly relevant as it deals with writing the operation in a way that it can be executed. The method includes a set of imports and processes each operation, but it seems to lack a direct handling of the 'models' import. Additionally, the 'MigrationWriter.serialize' method is responsible for serializing values into a form that can be written into the migration file. Given the context, the relevant code spans are those dealing with the serialization and import handling in the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes. These spans will help in identifying where the import handling logic might be inadequate or missing for the 'models' module, which will be crucial for fixing the reported issue.",
