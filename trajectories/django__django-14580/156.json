By examining the provided search results, particularly the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, it is evident that the logic for generating migration files, including the addition of necessary imports, is handled within the 'MigrationWriter' class. Specifically, the 'as_string' method constructs the migration file content and is responsible for adding the necessary imports. The current logic checks if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports, and if so, it adds 'migrations' alongside it, otherwise, it just imports 'migrations'. This logic might be missing a case to handle when 'models' itself is not imported. The relevant code span to address this would be in the 'as_string' method where it checks for the presence of 'models' and adjusts the imports accordingly. This is the relevant area where a fix could potentially be applied to ensure that 'models' is imported if it is needed in the migration file.",
