I have examined the search results from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class handles the generation of migration files, and its 'as_string' method specifically manages the imports. The code in this method adds some imports, but it may not always ensure 'from django.db import models' is included. The second file, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', which defines operations like 'CreateModel', is less directly related to the import issue but may contribute indirectly. However, the main issue likely lies in 'MigrationWriter' specifically in how imports are managed in the 'as_string' method.
