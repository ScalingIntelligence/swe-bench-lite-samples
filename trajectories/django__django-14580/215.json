The relevant code likely resides within the Django migration generation process, specifically the writer module. Given the error and the example provided, the focus should be on `django.db.migrations.writer` and the related operations where the models are used or referenced. The `MigrationWriter` class seems to be a critical part of this process, as it handles the serialization and writing of migration files. Additionally, considering the specific error in the migration file, it is possible that the `CreateModel` operation in `django.db.migrations.operations.models` might also be involved in the issue.",

The focus is on the django.db.migrations module, and specifically the MigrationWriter class within django/db/migrations/writer.py. This class is responsible for generating the migration files. The relevant code spans include the MigrationWriter class definition and the as_string method within it, which constructs the migration file content. The operation to handle model-related changes is found in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py, specifically the CreateModel class. This class is used to create new models in migrations, likely involved in the generation of the problematic migration file. The relevant code spans here include the CreateModel class and its initialization method __init__. Both of these spans are crucial for understanding how migrations for models are created and how the import statements are managed or could be missed.

The `CreateModel` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is also relevant as it defines how models are created during migrations. The context includes logic for handling imports and operations, which aligns with the issue description of a missing import statement for 'models'. The code provided seems sufficient to understand and potentially resolve the issue related to missing import statements in generated migration files. The code provided also includes handling for imports, indicating that the system is designed to manage import statements, but there might be a specific case not covered that leads to the reported issue.",
