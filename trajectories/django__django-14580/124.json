This suggests a problem in the migration file generation process. Potential points of interest include the migration writer and the migration operation handling. Given the stack trace, the migration file generation seems to be failing due to the missing import statement. Focus should be on the django.db.migrations.writer and django.db.migrations.operations.models modules.",

The 'MigrationWriter' class also deals with the generation of migration files and manages imports. In 'serializer.py', several serializers are defined, including 'ModelFieldSerializer' and 'ModelManagerSerializer', which are likely relevant due to their handling of model fields and managers. The 'models.py' file defines model operations, which could also be relevant context for understanding the issue. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in 'writer.py' under the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes.

The 'OperationWriter' class is responsible for serializing individual operations. Inside its 'serialize' method, it handles the serialization of operation arguments, which can be complex types like lists, tuples, or dictionaries. These types are recursively handled, and their serialization results in an import set that is collected and used later. On the other hand, the 'MigrationWriter' class is responsible for the overall serialization of a migration. In its 'as_string' method, it aggregates serializations from all individual operations. It also handles the imports necessary for the migration file, including the potential addition of 'from django.db import migrations, models' unless 'from django.db import models' already exists. Given this information, the key areas to inspect for potential issues include the handling of imports in 'MigrationWriter' during the aggregation of individual operation serializations, specifically around ensuring 'models' is included when it should be.

Furthermore, the MigrationWriter class, while sorting imports and handling them gracefully during the aggregation of individual operation serializations, does not explicitly force the addition of 'models' when it is logically required. The logic of 'if \"from django.db import models\" in imports' that adds 'migrations, models' happens after discarding 'models', suggesting a miss in reinforcing the inclusion of 'models' when necessary.
