This suggests that the migration file generator is not properly including the necessary import statements. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily in django/db/migrations/writer.py, which is responsible for writing the migration files. The relevant spans include those related to the 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' classes, particularly the 'serialize' method in 'OperationWriter' and the '__init__' method in 'MigrationWriter'. These methods are responsible for converting the operations and migration objects into Python code that can be written to a file. The issue is likely related to how these methods handle imports, potentially missing the 'from django.db import models' import. Additional relevant code spans can be found in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py where the model operations are defined, and in django/db/migrations/serializer.py where the serializers for various types are defined, including ModelFieldSerializer and OperationSerializer. These provide context on how models and operations are serialized into migration files. Based on the search results, the identified code spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially fix the issue with missing import statements in generated migration files.",
