The issue is related to the generation of the migration file, indicating a potential problem in the Django migration writing process.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant files and code spans:\n\n1. **django/db/migrations/writer.py**: This file contains the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes, which are responsible for writing migration files. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method is particularly relevant as it serializes operations into a string, which is part of the migration file generation process. The method includes logic to handle imports and serialization of various types of arguments, including models.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/serializer.py**: This file contains various serializer classes used by the migration writer to serialize different types of data. The 'ModelFieldSerializer' and 'ModelManagerSerializer' classes are relevant because they handle serialization of model fields and managers, respectively. The 'TypeSerializer' class is also relevant as it handles the serialization of types, including models.\n\n3. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py**: This file contains the 'MigrationAutodetector' class, which is responsible for detecting changes in the models and generating the corresponding migration operations. While this file doesn't directly address the import issue, it is important context for understanding the overall migration generation process.\n\nFrom the analysis, the most relevant code spans for addressing the missing import statement issue are in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, specifically the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method. This method is where the serialization and import handling for migration operations occur.",

The error occurs when the migration file is generated by Django's MigrationWriter and includes a class definition for 'MyModel' that references 'models.Model' without importing the 'models' module. This indicates a potential bug in the MigrationWriter class or its related methods.\n\nThe current file context and search results provide insight into the MigrationWriter class and its methods, particularly the 'serialize' method in the OperationWriter class. This method is responsible for generating the code for the migration operations. The OperationWriter.serialize method uses the MigrationWriter.serialize method to serialize individual elements of the operation, but it does not explicitly ensure that all necessary imports are included.\n\nThe relevant code spans include the entire 'OperationWriter' class and the 'MigrationWriter' class, as these are central to the generation of the migration file. Specifically, the 'OperationWriter.serialize' and 'MigrationWriter.serialize' methods are crucial, as they handle the serialization of migration operations and values, which could be where the missing import is introduced.\n\nGiven the error message and the nature of the issue, it appears that the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method should be reviewed to ensure that all required imports (like 'from django.db import models') are included in the generated migration file. Additionally, the 'MigrationWriter' class should be inspected to see if it has a role in managing or setting the necessary imports for the migration file.\n\nThe identified relevant code spans are:\n1. The 'OperationWriter' class with its '__init__' and 'serialize' methods.\n2. The 'MigrationWriter' class with its '__init__' and 'serialize' methods.\n\nThese spans are essential for understanding and potentially correcting the issue of missing import statements in the generated migration files.",

The key sections to focus on are where the migration files are being generated and how imports are managed. In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'MigrationWriter' class handles the creation of the migration file in its 'as_string' method. This method constructs the migration script including the necessary imports. The current logic adds 'from django.db import migrations', but it does not always ensure 'models' is included when needed. This seems to be the root cause mentioned in the issue. Also, in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is responsible for defining operations related to models during migrations. However, this file is more about defining operations than the actual generation of the migration script. The spans 'imports' in both files are relevant as they show the current import logic and its handling. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' and 'MigrationWriter.as_string' methods are particularly relevant for addressing the issue because they handle the serialization and formatting of the migration script, including the necessary imports.",
