This issue points to potential problems in the migration generation process. To debug this, we should focus on the 'writer.py' file within the 'django.db.migrations' module, as this is responsible for writing the migration files. Additionally, since the error occurs in the migration file, examining the 'operations/models.py' file might also be beneficial to understand how model operations are handled during migration generation.",

These files are responsible for actually generating the migration files and handling the operations within the migrations.\n\nThe 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file contains the 'MigrationWriter' and 'OperationWriter' classes. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method is particularly relevant as it constructs the migration file content. Within this method, imports are handled and added to the migration file. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method currently checks for and adds 'from django.db import models' but does not handle the case where 'models' is used directly without an import.\n\nThe 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file contains operations related to models, such as 'CreateModel'. While this file does not directly generate the migration files, understanding how these operations integrate with the migration process can help in identifying where the import statement might be missing.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those that handle the serialization and generation of the migration file content.
