The issue is specifically related to how Django's migration writer handles the serialization of operations and the addition of import statements. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans can be found in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' within the 'MigrationWriter' class and the 'OperationWriter' class. Both these classes play a crucial role in generating the migration file, and specifically, the 'OperationWriter.serialize' method and the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method need to be examined for their handling of importing necessary modules. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method is responsible for writing the operations in the migration file and handling their imports. The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method constructs the final migration file with all necessary imports and operations. Therefore, these two methods are directly related to the issue reported. Notably, the issue might be due to the logic in the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method where the import statements are processed; it seems like an explicit check for the 'models' module import is missing, leading to its omission in the generated file.",
