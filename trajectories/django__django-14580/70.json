This leads to a NameError when attempting to execute the migration, as 'models' is not defined. To address this, we need to identify code spans within the Django codebase that are related to the generation of migration files, especially those that handle the import statements or model references. We start by examining the search results provided. Among the results, there are several files that are relevant to migrations and model handling in Django: 'django/db/migrations/__init__.py', 'django/db/migrations/state.py', and 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py'. The 'state.py' file is particularly interesting as it contains imports and functions that directly interact with models. This file also has functions that resolve fields and relations, which may indicate where model imports are handled or should be added. Moreover, 'recorder.py' contains a Migration class that interacts with models and might be where the import is missing based on the issue description. The 'exceptions.py' file is also looked at but seems less relevant to the immediate issue of missing imports.",

The search results provide insight into the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, which contains the 'MigrationWriter' class responsible for writing migration files. In the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, the logic for generating the imports section of the migration file is found. The code checks if 'from django.db import models' is among the imports, and if so, it ensures that 'migrations' is also included in the import statement. However, there is no explicit logic to check for the presence of 'models' if it isn't already included, suggesting that there might be a gap in handling the automatic inclusion of necessary imports. This is relevant to the reported issue as it indicates where improvements might be needed to ensure all necessary imports are included in the generated migration files.",

While the `models` module is not directly imported in the `MigrationWriter`, it is handled within the operations serialization. This suggests that the `MigrationWriter` might need to ensure that all necessary imports, including the `models` module, are correctly included in the generated migration files.
