This leads to a NameError because 'models' is not defined in the migration file. The provided search results include two main files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. The former is particularly relevant as it includes the 'MigrationWriter' class responsible for writing the migration files. Specifically, the 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class manages the imports for the migration file. Here, if 'from django.db import models' is found in the imports, it is adjusted to include 'from django.db import migrations, models'. However, if 'from django.db import models' is not found, it only adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This behavior suggests that the import statement 'from django.db import models' might not always be appropriately managed in the generated migration files. The 'CreateModel' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is also relevant as it is an operation often used in migrations to create new models. This operation includes the 'models' module in its imports and actively uses 'models.Model' in its implementation. However, this file does not directly address the issue of the missing import statement in the generated migration file but provides context on how the 'CreateModel' operation is handled, potentially influencing the migration file's content.",

The analysis of the file context shows that the MigrationWriter class in 'writer.py' indeed handles the writing of migration files and includes logic for managing imports, but it does not explicitly ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included when necessary. This could be the root cause, as the MigrationWriter class misses adding this import when writing the 'models' module usage in the migration file. On the other hand, the 'models.py' file within the operations directory correctly imports 'models' from django.db, which should be a part of the generated migration file. Given the provided context, it seems that the core issue might revolve around how imports are managed in the MigrationWriter class.",
