The search results focus on the django/db/migrations/writer.py file, which is pertinent as it is responsible for writing migration files. The OperationWriter class and its methods are crucial for serializing migration operations, and the MigrationWriter class is central to the generation of the migration file itself. The missing import statement for 'models' is likely to be dealt with in the MigrationWriter.as_string() method, which constructs the migration file's content. The code currently adds 'from django.db import migrations' to the imports, but the addition of 'models' needs to be handled such that 'from django.db import migrations, models' is correctly included when 'models' is referenced. This logic can potentially be found within the MigrationWriter.as_string() method or within the imports handling section of this class. The specific spans of code to inspect are those that handle the imports, including the area where the decision to include 'models' is made. Additionally, the OperationWriter.serialize() method is critical as it serializes individual operations, where ensuring the correct imports are included is essential.",

Both files contain code related to the migration generation and serialization process. The relevant sections are those that handle the serialization of the migration operations and the generation of the migration file itself. Specifically, the OperationWriter class in writer.py and the TypeSerializer class in serializer.py are critical for generating the migration code and ensuring the 'models' module is imported when needed. The existing context shows parts of these classes, and the new search results provide more detailed methods from these classes. The issue at hand is likely related to the MigrationWriter class or the serialize methods in these classes not handling the 'models' import correctly, leading to the NameError in the migration files. The identified spans include the entire MigrationWriter class and parts of the OperationWriter class. Since the issue involves missing imports in generated migration files, the focus should be on methods related to serialization and generating import statements, especially those handling the 'models' module.

The code provided outlines how imports are controlled and managed in the context of migration file creation, but it does not directly address the issue of a missing 'models' import that the reported issue suggests is omitted under certain conditions. The approach to handling imports, including 'from django.db import models', is influenced by the logic in the 'if \"from django.db import models\" in imports' and 'else' branches, which dictate whether to include 'models' in the import statements. The logic seems to assume that all necessary imports are being picked up by the system, but the reported issue suggests that this is not the case for 'models' in certain scenarios. Given the code visibility and the way imports are processed, the next step would involve deep-diving into the conditions that lead to an omission of this import.
