The specific files to investigate are those related to the migration writing process within Django's codebase. Given the description, the likely culprit is the django.db.migrations.writer module, specifically the MigrationWriter class. Additionally, checking the operations that involve model definitions, like the CreateModel class in django.db.migrations.operations.models, could be pertinent. The file django.db.migrations.__init__ is also relevant as it initializes migration classes.",

The issue seems to be related to the migration writer module in Django. Therefore, I need to focus on the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file and its 'MigrationWriter' class, where the migration files are generated. The current search results include the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, which is responsible for creating the string representation of the migration file. This method handles the imports and could be where the missing import is being omitted. However, the method seems to already handle some import logic, such as checking for duplicate imports and ensuring the 'from django.db import migrations' is included. The search results also include the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file, which handles model operations in migrations, but it doesn't directly relate to the migration file generation. I will focus on the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method to assess if it correctly includes the 'from django.db import models' import and identify any issues in that logic. As the current context is empty and I rely on the search results, analyzing the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method will be crucial to determine the relevance and ensure the provided code spans address the reported issue.",

Specifically, the class logic ensures that 'from django.db import migrations' is included in the imports and handles the inclusion of other necessary imports, but does not explicitly mention ensuring the inclusion of 'models' if it's used in the operations. This aligns with the reported issue of a missing import statement for 'models'.

This error occurs because the import statement 'from django.db import models' is missing from the generated migration file.\n\nThe provided file context and search results reveal two key files: 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. Both files are relevant to the issue as they involve the generation and operations of migrations.\n\nWithin the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', there is a 'MigrationWriter' class that is responsible for writing migration files. The method 'as_string' in this class is where the migration file content is generated. The method processes the imports for the migration file, and the relevant code span is the handling of the 'models' import. The code checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports and adjusts accordingly, but there seems to be an issue where this import might not be handled correctly, leading to the missing import in the generated file.\n\nIn the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'CreateModel' class is defined, which is used to create model operations in migrations. This class is relevant as it sets up the model creations, which are crucial elements in the migration files that would refer to 'models'.\n\nTo address the issue, the focus should be on the 'as_string' method in 'MigrationWriter' to ensure that 'from django.db import models' is properly added to the imports. This method should be reviewed to identify why this import might be omitted and corrected to ensure the import is always included when needed.",
