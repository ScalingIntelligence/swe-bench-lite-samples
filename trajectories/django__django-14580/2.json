Specifically, the migration file lacks an import statement for 'models', leading to a 'NameError'. This problem arises during the execution of the 'makemigrations' command when Django generates the migration file.\n\nExamining the provided search results, particularly the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', reveals crucial sections of code related to the generation of migration files. The 'as_string' method within 'MigrationWriter' is responsible for constructing the migration file's content, including managing imports. Notably, after reviewing the handling of imports and how they are added to the migration file, it is clear that the code does not explicitly check for the 'models' module import when constructing the migration file. This omission could lead to scenarios where the 'models' import is not included, resulting in the reported error.\n\nIn the 'CreateModel' class within 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', there are methods like 'state_forwards' and 'database_forwards' which handle the creation of models during migrations. However, while these methods deal with model operations, they do not directly influence or control the import statements in the generated migration file, which is the specific issue at hand.\n\nGiven the analysis, the relevant code spans that likely contribute to the missing import statement issue are within the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file. Specifically, the 'as_string' method of the 'MigrationWriter' class should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that an import statement for 'models' is always included when generating migration files.",

This method constructs the content of the migration file. The method collects imports from various operations, processes them, and adds them to the 'items' dictionary. The key part here is the handling of the 'models' import. The code checks if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports set. If it is, it modifies it to include 'migrations' as well.

This logic does not ensure that the 'models' import is added in all cases, which could explain the missing import in the generated migration file. \n\nTo resolve this issue, the 'models' import should be explicitly added whenever it is needed, and not rely on it being already present in the imports set.

The analysis of the codebase reveals that the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is responsible for generating the migration file. Within this class, the method 'as_string' is used to construct the content of the migration file. This method includes a block that processes and formats the import statements. It specifically checks if 'from django.db import models' is already in the imports set before adding it along with 'from django.db import migrations'. However, it does not handle cases where 'models' is referenced implicitly without being imported. To address the issue, the method 'as_string' should ensure that 'from django.db import models' is unconditionally included in the generated migration file if 'models' are referenced. This would prevent the 'NameError' by ensuring that the 'models' module is always available in the scope of the migration file. Search results also include relevant code from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', which show how models and fields are typically handled during migrations. However, the primary focus and solution need to be implemented in the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method to resolve the missing import statement issue.",
