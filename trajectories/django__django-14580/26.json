These files contain classes and methods responsible for the generation and serialization of migration operations, including the 'CreateModel' operation which is likely involved in the creation of the problematic migration file. The 'ModelOperation', 'CreateModel', and 'OperationWriter' classes are particularly relevant as they handle the construction and rendering of operations into migration files. The missing import might occur during the serialization or writing of these operations. Further inspection of these classes and their methods, especially 'CreateModel.serialize' and 'OperationWriter.serialize', is necessary to understand if they correctly handle and include all necessary imports.",

The 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method constructs the migration file content, including the imports section. However, the 'models' import is conditionally added based on the presence of certain types of imports. If the 'models' import is not explicitly added when needed, it will result in the missing import statement issue described.\n\nThe relevant code spans are located within the 'MigrationWriter' class methods: 'as_string', 'serialize', 'basedir', 'path', and the 'OperationWriter' class methods 'serialize', 'indent', 'unindent', and 'feed'. These methods handle the construction and serialization of the migration file content, including the import statements. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified, and it can be concluded that these spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

These files are responsible for defining migration operations, serializing objects, and writing migration files, respectively. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, the `CreateModel` class is defined, which is likely where the operation for creating `MyModel` is handled. The `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file contains various serializers, including `ModelFieldSerializer`, which could be relevant for serializing model fields. Lastly, `django/db/migrations/writer.py` includes the `OperationWriter` and `MigrationWriter` classes, which are responsible for writing the operations and migration files to disk, respectively. The `OperationWriter` class specifically deals with serializing operations and the `MigrationWriter` class handles the overall migration file creation.
