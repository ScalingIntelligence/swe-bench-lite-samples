Given the context provided, the problem seems to be related to the module django.db.migrations.writer where the migration files are being generated. Reviewing this module along with django.db.migrations.operations.models, which directly deals with model operations in migrations, should help in identifying the root cause. Additionally, checking the makemigrations command in django.core.management.commands.makemigrations might also provide insights into how the migration files are being structured.",

If 'models' is not already included, it adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This suggests that the mechanism for ensuring 'models' is imported exists but may not be comprehensive if 'models' is not referenced by any operations. Thus, a deeper investigation is needed to see if this mechanism covers all potential cases or if enhancements are required to ensure 'models' is imported in all scenarios.",
