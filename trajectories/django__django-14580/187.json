To resolve this, we should focus our search on the classes and methods involved in the migration file generation process within the django.db.migrations package. The MigrationWriter class in writer.py and the CreateModel class in operations/models.py seem particularly relevant as they handle writing migrations and creating models, respectively.",

The error message indicates that a migration file created by Django's makemigrations command is missing an import for 'models'. This is causing a 'NameError' because the 'models' module is not defined in the migration file. The provided search results contain the relevant code from 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', where the classes 'OperationWriter' and 'MigrationWriter' are responsible for generating migration files. These classes handle the serialization of operations and the creation of migration strings, which are then written to migration files. The code spans include methods for serializing operations and for generating the migration file's content. Notably, the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method includes handling for imports, but it does not explicitly check for the presence of 'models'. Since the issue is about a missing import statement specifically for 'models', it is crucial to focus on the 'MigrationWriter' and how imports are managed in the generated migration files. The corresponding code spans are those where the imports set is manipulated and specifically where the addition of the 'models' import should potentially be included or verified.
