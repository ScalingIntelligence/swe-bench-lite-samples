The search results provide insights into the code responsible for writing migrations, which is likely within the django.db.migrations.writer module. The code spans containing the MigrationWriter class and its methods reveal the logic for generating the migration file, including the handling of imports. In particular, the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' span processes the imports and operations for the migration file. However, despite handling various imports, it does not consistently ensure the 'models' module is imported, which could explain the reported issue. Additionally, the 'django.db.migrations.operations.models' module, which contains operations related to model changes in migrations, does include the 'from django.db import models' import in its 'imports' span, indicating that the import is expected to be present in migrations.

The as_string method handles the creation of the migration file content, including the imports section. The imports set collects all necessary imports for the migration file, but there's a specific handling for 'from django.db import models'. If 'from django.db import models' is found in the imports, it is replaced with 'from django.db import migrations, models' to ensure both migrations and models are imported. If it's not found, 'from django.db import migrations' is added. This indicates that the 'models' import is conditionally managed, suggesting that the automatic inclusion of 'models' might depend on the operations present in the migration. To ensure 'from django.db import models' is consistently included when needed, especially in operations involving models, it's crucial to check each operation's serialization and ensure it prompts the inclusion of 'models' if necessary. Additionally, investigate if any specific operations (like CreateModel) might not be triggering the necessary inclusion of 'models' in their serialization process.",

The user expects that Django should generate valid Python code in the migration file. Upon reviewing the provided code snippets, it is evident that the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is central to this issue as it contains the logic for writing migration files. The class 'MigrationWriter' in this file is responsible for generating the migration file content, including the import statements. Specifically, the method 'MigrationWriter.as_string' constructs the import block for the migration file. A key observation is that despite checking for the presence of 'models' in the imports, it doesn't ensure that 'from django.db import models' is included if it's missing, which could be the root cause of the issue. This is where the bug likely resides. The other files provided, such as 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' and 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py', support the logic related to model operations in migrations and serialization of different objects, respectively. These files, however, do not directly address the missing import issue in the migration file generation.",

However, it does not address the case where 'models' is not present but should be added based on the operations involved. The logic to evaluate the operations is between lines 138-143.

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
