The error suggests that the module django.db.migrations.writer might be responsible. To identify the exact location of the problem, we need to focus on the MigrationWriter class and its related methods in the writer.py file. Additionally, the operations related to model creation in the operations/models.py file should be examined to ensure they are properly handling imports. It's also worth checking the makemigrations command and its interaction with these components.",

The error occurs during the execution of the generated migration, indicating that 'models' is not defined. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that are responsible for generating the migration file and ensure that the import statement is correctly included. \n\nFrom the search results, the file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' contains the relevant code for the MigrationWriter class, which is responsible for writing migration files. The 'as_string' method in this class constructs the migration file content and includes necessary imports. However, the code currently does not explicitly add an import for 'models' from 'django.db' if it's referenced in the migration operations. This is a potential cause of the issue. \n\nAnother related file, 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py', uses the MigrationWriter class to write the migration files. This file is also relevant as it directly interacts with the migration writing process. \n\nIn summary, the critical areas to focus on are the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and its 'as_string' method, as well as the 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py' that uses MigrationWriter.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
