The search results include multiple files, but the most relevant one is 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'. This file contains the `MigrationWriter` class which is responsible for writing the migration files. The missing import statement should likely be added in this class or its methods. Examining the '__init__' method of `MigrationWriter` shows that it initializes the migration, but does not explicitly handle imports, which could be the issue at hand. Additionally, the `CreateModel` class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is also relevant as it directly deals with creating model operations in migrations. The issue could be related to how this class handles or generates model-related operations without ensuring that the necessary imports (like 'models') are included in the migration files. Specific spans such as 'MigrationWriter' and parts of its '__init__' method, as well as 'CreateModel' and its '__init__' and 'database_forwards' methods, are identified as relevant for further examination. This selection is based on the understanding that these parts of the code are involved in the writing and execution of migrations and could potentially address the missing import issue. Next steps would involve closer inspection of these spans to identify where the import statement is missing and how it can be rectified.",

The error occurs because the 'models' module is not imported in the generated migration script, leading to a 'NameError'. To address this, it is crucial to identify the relevant code spans in the Django migration writer module that handle the generation of import statements in the migration files. The provided context includes the 'writer.py' file, which contains the 'MigrationWriter' class responsible for generating the migration scripts. The specific method of interest is 'MigrationWriter.as_string', which constructs the string representation of the migration file, including the imports section. The new search results reveal more details about how the imports are managed within this method, particularly the handling of the 'from django.db import models' import. The analysis shows that the method already attempts to ensure that the 'models' import is included when necessary. However, the logic seems to inadvertently exclude it in certain conditions, leading to the reported issue. By identifying the specific code spans within 'MigrationWriter.as_string' that manage import inclusion, we can determine the exact points where the 'models' import might be omitted and plan necessary corrections.",

The relevant code spans that deal with the generation of migration files include the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods 'as_string', '__init__', and 'serialize'. These methods handle the creation and serialization of the migration file content. The key part to note is the management of imports in the 'as_string' method. It updates the imports set and ensures certain imports like 'from django.db import models' are included. However, in the provided context and search results, the handling of the 'models' import appears to be incomplete. There is a conditional check to add 'from django.db import models' but it seems to be removed under certain conditions, which might cause the import to be omitted. This could be the reason for the missing import statement in the generated migration file.
