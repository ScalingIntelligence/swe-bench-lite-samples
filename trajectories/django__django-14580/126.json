The new search results include additional code spans from the same file, focusing on the 'OperationWriter' class and further methods in 'MigrationWriter'. The key analysis involves checking if the import statement 'from django.db import models' is correctly handled in the 'as_string' method of 'MigrationWriter'. The relevant sections involve how imports are managed in the 'as_string' method, specifically the handling of 'models' import within existing imports. The issue suggests that the 'models' import is not correctly included in the generated migration file, leading to a 'NameError'. By examining the 'as_string' method in detail, I can determine if the current logic correctly handles the 'models' import or if it requires adjustment.
