These sections handle the serialization and generation of migration files.\n\nIn the 'OperationWriter.serialize' function, there's a mechanism to handle imports for operations, and in 'MigrationWriter.as_string', the serialization of the entire migration file is managed. The key to resolving the issue seems to be ensuring that 'from django.db import models' is included in the list of imports when generating the migration file. This can be done by updating the handling of imports in the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' function to ensure that 'models' is imported when needed in the context of migration generation.\n\nThe 'serializer.py' file also contains relevant code related to serializing various types, including models, but based on the reported issue, the focus should primarily be on the 'writer.py' file. The goal is to ensure that the 'models' module is correctly imported in the generated migration files when it's required by the operations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to focus on are within the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, particularly those handling the serialization and import management during migration file generation.",
