Given the context, the main areas to investigate are the `writer.py` and `operations/models.py` files within the `django/db/migrations` directory. These files are responsible for writing the migration files and defining model operations respectively. The missing import statement for 'models' could be due to an oversight in how these operations or migrations are serialized or written to files.",

I will be happy to assist with debugging.\nThanks for your attention,\nJaap Joris\n"
