To find the root cause, we need to focus on the code that handles the generation of migration files and the insertion of import statements. We should look for the exact spot where the import for 'models' is either missing or not properly handled.",

The provided search results reveal the relevant files and functions within the Django codebase that manage the generation of migration files. Notably, the 'MigrationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is responsible for writing migration files. The 'as_string' method of this class handles the construction of the migration file content, including the management of imports. The provided code span 'MigrationWriter.as_string' includes logic to add necessary imports to the migration file. Despite this, the import of 'from django.db import models' is not consistently included where required, thus causing the reported error. This analysis suggests that the relevant code span to address the issue is 'MigrationWriter.as_string' in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py'.",

The `as_string` method in `MigrationWriter` is of particular interest as it constructs the content of the migration file, including the handling of imports. The current implementation of `as_string` manages imports and specifically checks if 'from django.db import models' is already included to ensure it's correctly added along with 'migrations'. This logic aligns with the issue of missing imports, suggesting that modifications or adjustments might be needed in this method to ensure all necessary imports are included during the migration file generation process.",
