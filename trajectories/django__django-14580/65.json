To address this, it's necessary to examine the code responsible for generating the migration file. The search results include the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which contains the `MigrationWriter` class responsible for writing migration files. The relevant spans to investigate are those dealing with the import statements and the generation of the migration string. Specifically, the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class handles the creation of the migration file content and the management of import statements. This method adds the 'from django.db import migrations' statement but does not ensure that 'models' is also included when necessary. This oversight could be the cause of the missing import statement in the generated migration file. Therefore, the identified spans include the entire `as_string` method to understand how imports are managed and potentially updated to ensure 'models' is included when needed.",
