Among the code spans, the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method is particularly relevant. This method constructs the string representation of a migration file, including the imports. Inspection of the method reveals that it handles the imports for the migration file, including the `models` import. There is a particular logic block that checks if 'from django.db import models' is in the imports, and if so, it modifies the imports to include both 'migrations' and 'models'. This code block should help solve the issue by ensuring the 'models' import is correctly included in the generated migration file.
