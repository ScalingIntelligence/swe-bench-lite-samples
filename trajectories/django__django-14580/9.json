The stack trace points to the file being generated by the django.db.migrations.writer module. To address this, I will focus the search on the django.db.migrations.writer module, with a specific focus on the MigrationWriter class and related operations. Additionally, I will look into the CreateModel operation within the django.db.migrations.operations.models module, as it seems to be related to the generation of the migration file. Lastly, I will check the serializer functions in the django.db.migrations.serializer module to ensure proper handling of model references during serialization.",

The search results provide insights into the relevant parts of the Django codebase that could be responsible for generating the migration file and handling the import statements. The primary focus should be on the `MigrationWriter` class within `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, as it is responsible for generating the migration file and handling the imports. The method `MigrationWriter.as_string` is particularly relevant, as it constructs the migration file content, including the imports. Within this method, there is a section where imports are added or removed. Specifically, if 'from django.db import models' is not in the imports set, 'from django.db import migrations' is added, but not the models import. This omission could be the cause of the issue. Additionally, the `CreateModel` class within `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is relevant as it is involved in defining operations related to model creation within migrations. Reviewing how these operations are serialized and how imports are managed in these contexts could help identify if any additional imports are missing or mishandled. It's also important to note the `ModelManagerSerializer` and `OperationSerializer` classes within `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, as they handle the serialization of models and operations, though their relevance seems less direct compared to the writer and operations modules.",
