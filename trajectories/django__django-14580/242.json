This error occurs in the context of Django's migration system, specifically in the migration file generated by Django's MigrationWriter class. The search results include the relevant file 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', which contains the definition of the MigrationWriter class. Within this class, the 'as_string' method is responsible for generating the content of the migration file. There are several key spans in this method: 1. The span where imports are collected and processed. 2. The part where operations in the migration are serialized and added to the migration file. 3. The section where dependencies are processed and added. Notably, the code currently handles adding 'from django.db import migrations, models' correctly if 'from django.db import models' is detected. However, the issue implies that this handling might be incomplete or insufficient in some cases. Therefore, the relevant spans to investigate further are those related to handling imports and specifically the generation of the import statements in the migration file.",
