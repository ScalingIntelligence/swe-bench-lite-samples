This issue can be traced back to the module responsible for generating the migration files, specifically django/db/migrations/writer.py. The relevant code spans in this module are those that handle the serialization of migration operations, as they are responsible for generating the Python code for the migration files. I identified the following key spans in the search results that I believe are relevant:\n\n1. The 'OperationWriter' class and its methods ('serialize', 'feed')\n2. The 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods ('as_string', 'basedir', 'serialize')\n\nThe 'serialize' method in the 'OperationWriter' class is crucial as it generates the Python code for the operations in the migration. The 'as_string' method in the 'MigrationWriter' class is also critical as it constructs the full migration file content, including imports. Both methods process the imports and code generation aspects. Despite the code spans handling the import logic like processing imports and updating imports set, it appears that the handling of the 'models' import might be missing or not correctly included. Observing the 'MigrationWriter.as_string' method, it manages the imports but doesn't explicitly mention importing 'models' which is the core issue stated by the user. Thus, these spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially resolve the issue.",

Notably, there's a specific handling for the 'models' import where it ensures that 'from django.db import models' is included if necessary. Given the depth and detail of this code, it seems to address the issue of missing import statements effectively, especially with the explicit handling of the 'models' import.
