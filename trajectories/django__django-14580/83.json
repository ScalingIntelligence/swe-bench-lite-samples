The error specifically points to 'models' not being defined in the migration file. The search results provided focus on the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' files, which are likely candidates for solving this issue. In the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, there are several spans of code that deal with the creation and management of migration files, including the 'MigrationWriter' class and its methods. This class is responsible for generating the migration file and includes logic for handling imports. A key method here is 'MigrationWriter.as_string', which constructs the content of the migration file. The analysis of this method shows logic for adding necessary imports, including 'from django.db import models'. However, there is a specific part where it checks for 'from django.db import models' and adjusts the imports accordingly. This logic should ensure that the 'models' module is imported in the generated migration file. The 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file contains operations related to model manipulations during migrations, but the issue reported isn't directly related to these operations but rather the generation of the migration file. Based on the code spans provided and the context of the issue, the relevant code spans are within the 'MigrationWriter' class in the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file, specifically focusing on how imports are handled and ensuring 'models' is included. This should help in resolving the reported issue of 'models' not being defined in the generated migration files.",

If it is, it removes it from the set and adds 'from django.db import migrations, models' to ensure that 'models' is included. If 'from django.db import models' is not present, it simply adds 'from django.db import migrations'. This logic aims to ensure that the 'models' import is always available in the migration file.

Additionally, I should examine the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method, which assembles the migration file content, including the handling of imports.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant sections include:\n1. The `imports` span in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, where the base imports for the module are declared.\n2. The `MigrationWriter` class definition and its methods, especially `__init__`, `as_string`, and `serialize`.\n3. The `OperationWriter` class within the same file, which is likely involved in the serialization of migration operations.\n\nI will extract these spans for further analysis and to confirm their relevance to the reported issue.",
