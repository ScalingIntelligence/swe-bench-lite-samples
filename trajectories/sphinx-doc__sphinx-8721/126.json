This issue involves the `viewcode` extension and its interaction with the epub builder. From the search results, the most relevant code spans are in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`, particularly the functions `doctree_read`, `collect_pages`, and `should_generate_module_page`. These functions handle the logic for creating and managing module pages for viewcode, including the conditions under which pages are generated. The check `if app.builder.name.startswith(\"epub\") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub` in `doctree_read` is especially relevant, as it should ideally prevent module pages from being created for epub when the config is disabled. However, the bug suggests this check is not working as expected. Additionally, the `collect_pages` function also generates pages based on the modules collected, and `should_generate_module_page` determines whether to generate a specific module page, considering timestamps and other factors but does not mention the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting directly. These code spans are relevant as they directly relate to the issue's functionality and could be the source of the bug.",

If viewcode_enable_epub is False and the builder name starts with 'epub', the function returns early, suggesting that it should prevent the creation of epub pages for viewcode. However, the issue reported indicates that pages are still being created. This suggests that either the condition is not correctly preventing the creation, or there may be other parts of the code not shown here that are overriding this behavior. Other functions like collect_pages and should_generate_module_page are also related to generating module pages and could potentially contribute to the issue if not properly gated by the configuration setting.

This issue is directly related to the handling of epub builds in the Sphinx documentation tool. The analysis of the provided search results and the relevant code in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` reveals the source of the problem. The function `doctree_read` checks if the builder's name starts with 'epub' and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. If these conditions are met, the function returns early, which is meant to prevent the generation of module pages for epub. However, the issue arises because despite this check, the module pages are still being created. This could be due to a logical error or a deeper interaction with other parts of the code during the epub build process. The specific issue of ensuring that module pages are not created when `viewcode_enable_epub=False` requires focusing on the logic within `doctree_read` and its interactions with the epub builder.",

Based on the file context and search results, the relevant file is `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`. In this file, the function `doctree_read` contains logic that checks if the builder's name starts with 'epub' and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is False, it should return early to prevent further processing for epub. This logic directly addresses the issue by conditionally disabling viewcode processing for epub based on the configuration setting. Additionally, the `setup` function initializes the configuration setting `viewcode_import` and connects relevant event handlers, indicating that changes to the configuration or event handlers might affect the behavior described in the issue.",
