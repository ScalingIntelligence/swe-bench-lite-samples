This indicates that the control logic for this setting is not effectively preventing the generation of these pages. From the provided search results, several key functions in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` are relevant. Specifically, the `should_generate_module_page` function determines whether a module page should be generated, and the `collect_pages` function actually collects and generates pages for epub. Additionally, in `sphinx/builders/epub3.py`, the `Epub3Builder` class and its methods show how epub files are built, which is important context for understanding how the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting impacts the build process for an epub. These functions and classes seem relevant because modifying or checking them could help resolve the reported issue by making sure that when `viewcode_enable_epub=False`, no module pages for epub format are generated.",

The issue indicates that even with this configuration, module pages are being created for the ePub output. Key elements from the issue include the function of `viewcode_enable_epub` and the generation of ePub pages. Reviewing the current file context, two main files are identified: one related to the viewcode extension (`sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`) and another for the ePub builder (`sphinx/builders/epub3.py`). Both files contain relevant code spans, with particular attention to the `collect_pages` function in `viewcode.py`, which generates pages for modules, and the setup function in both files, which configures the behavior based on various config values, including `viewcode_enable_epub`.\n\nNew search results focus on `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`, specifically on the `collect_pages` function. This function seems to be central as it determines which module pages to generate. It iterates through module names and decides if a page should be generated based on the result of `should_generate_module_page`. This function takes into account the module's filename and the modification times to decide if generation is needed. The setup function in `viewcode.py` also adds the `viewcode_enable_epub` config value, tying it directly to the reported behavior. From the new results, it appears that `collect_pages` is the main section to focus on, as it controls the generation of module pages, which should be influenced by the `viewcode_enable_epub` config. Therefore, this code span is highly relevant to fixing the reported issue.",

Additionally, the `doctree_read` function uses the environment's config to decide whether to process further for epub builders. In the search results, the `collect_pages` function is also relevant as it generates the pages for the modules, but it relies on the `should_generate_module_page` function to decide whether to generate a page for a module.
