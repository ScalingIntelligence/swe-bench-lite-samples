The main function to focus on is 'doctree_read' in 'sphinx/ext/viewcode.py', which checks if the builder's name starts with 'epub' and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, then it returns early. This implies that 'viewcode' should handle this configuration correctly. However, the bug suggests that this condition is not effectively preventing the generation of epub pages. It is crucial to verify the logic around these conditions in 'doctree_read' function and ensure that it correctly respects the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting. Additionally, the 'collect_pages' function should also respect this configuration. Other functions like 'setup' are relevant as they register the 'viewcode_enable_epub' configuration and connect the necessary event handlers. The 'EpubBuilder' and its derived classes like 'Epub3Builder' are also relevant as they determine the behavior of epub builders and might affect how 'viewcode' interacts with them.",
