This suggests that the configuration setting `viewcode_enable_epub` is not properly respected when building the epub output.\n\nFrom the search results, several code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. In `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`, the `doctree_read` function checks if the builder's name starts with 'epub' and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is false, it returns. This is directly related to the condition that should prevent epub pages from being created when `viewcode_enable_epub=False`.\n\n2. The `collect_pages` function also seems relevant as it generates the module pages for viewcode. It iterates over `env._viewcode_modules` and yields pages. This could be where the issue arises if the function does not properly respect `viewcode_enable_epub`.\n\nConsidering these, the identified spans from `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` are likely the most relevant for debugging and potentially fixing the issue.",

The lint errors indicate that variables are being used before they are assigned, which suggests an improper structure in the function. The function should be revised to ensure all variable assignments occur before any early return statements, and the return logic should be suitably adjusted. However, upon reviewing the updated code context, it appears that the early return should still be conditionally applied at the beginning of the `doctree_read` function, which was the original intention. Therefore, the current approach is valid. Proceeding with the suggested adjustment to the code block should resolve the linting issues without altering the core functionality, solely addressing the formal lint error seen in the context of the updated code file.",
