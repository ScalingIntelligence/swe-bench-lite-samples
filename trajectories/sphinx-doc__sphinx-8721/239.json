By examining the provided search results, I initially focused on the 'doctree_read' function, which is responsible for reading the document tree during the build process. This function checks if the builder's name starts with 'epub' (which implies an epub builder) and whether 'viewcode_enable_epub' is False. If both conditions are met, it returns, effectively skipping the subsequent code that processes module code for epub generation. This indicated a strong relevance to the issue reported. However, to ensure comprehensive understanding, I also reviewed the 'collect_pages' function as it also interacts with module code generation and could potentially be a place where logic around the 'viewcode_enable_epub' configuration is overlooked. Upon deeper inspection, especially at the point where it checks 'if should_generate_module_page(app, modname):', it reinforces that these functions are crucial to ensure that module pages are only generated when intended. Given this analysis, both 'doctree_read' and 'collect_pages' functions within 'sphinx/ext/viewcode.py' are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue regarding the processing of module code for epub when the configuration states not to.",
