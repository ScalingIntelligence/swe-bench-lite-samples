The search results provide several files related to the epub build process and the viewcode extension.

Specifically, the `doctree_read` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` is where the condition check for `viewcode_enable_epub` should be present but is not fully shown in the provided spans. Checking the entire function is crucial to verify how this condition is handled. Additionally, the `EpubBuilder` class in `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py` and the `Epub3Builder` class in `sphinx/builders/epub3.py` are key for understanding how the epub build process integrates with the viewcode extension settings.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe issue reported by the user is that viewcode creates pages for epub even when `viewcode_enable_epub=False` on `make html epub`. This indicates a problem with the extension's handling of the epub builder when the configuration option to disable epub viewcode is set. By examining the `doctree_read` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`, it is clear that the extension checks if the builder name starts with 'epub' and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is False, it should return and not proceed with creating viewcode pages for epub. However, the fact that the pages are still being created implies a potential oversight or misconfiguration in the handling of this condition. Additionally, the `collect_pages` function is relevant as it is responsible for generating the module pages, which should be influenced by the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting. The provided search results do not reveal any additional code spans relevant to addressing this issue beyond what is already in the file context, suggesting that the existing code is indeed the focus for resolving the reported problem.",
