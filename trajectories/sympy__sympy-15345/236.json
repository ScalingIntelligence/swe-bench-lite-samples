The expected output is 'Max[x,2]', which is valid Mathematica code, but the actual output is 'Max(2, x)', which is not valid. This discrepancy suggests that the method responsible for printing the `Max` function in the `MCodePrinter` class within the `mathematica.py` file might be the source of the problem. Additionally, other files such as `ccode.py`, `cxxcode.py`, and `latex.py` contain methods related to handling the `Max` function, which could also be potential sources of the issue. Focusing on these files and methods should help in identifying and resolving the problem.",

Specifically, the expected output is 'Max[x,2]' in valid Mathematica code, but the actual output is 'Max(2, x)' which is not valid. This discrepancy suggests that the 'Max' function is not being printed correctly by the MCodePrinter class in the 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' file. Given the nature of the issue, it is crucial to identify if there is a specific method in the MCodePrinter class responsible for printing 'Max' functions in Mathematica code. The search results do not directly show a '_print_Max' method in the MCodePrinter class, which might indicate where the problem lies. However, the other code printers show implementations of '_print_Max' which could be helpful for understanding how to properly implement this for the MCodePrinter.",
