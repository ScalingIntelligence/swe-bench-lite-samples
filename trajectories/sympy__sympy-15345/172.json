This discrepancy indicates that there might be an issue with how the Max function is being printed or handled specifically for Mathematica code generation. The relevant code spans identified are those methods named `_print_Max` in different printer classes, as these methods are responsible for generating the string representation of the Max function. The identified spans include: `C89CodePrinter._print_Max`, `C99CodePrinter._print_Max`, `_CXXCodePrinterBase._print_Max`, `TensorflowPrinter._print_Max`, and `NumPyPrinter._print_Max`. These methods seem to be responsible for generating the code string for the Max function for different contexts like C, C++, Tensorflow, and NumPy. The solutions in these methods do not directly address the Mathematica context, indicating a potential gap in the codebase for proper Mathematica code generation.",

The expected output is valid Mathematica code, while the actual output is not. This discrepancy indicates a possible issue in the way the `Max` function is being handled in the `mathematica_code` function or in the underlying code printers used by SymPy. From the search results, there are several code spans that deal with the `Max` function in different contexts (C89, C99, C++98, TensorFlow, and NumPy printers). These code spans likely represent the different ways the `Max` function is implemented and handled across various SymPy's code printers. Notably, for TensorFlow and NumPy, the `Max` function is directly handled by calling their respective maximum functions (`maximum` and `numpy.amax`), suggesting that these implementations might not be causing the issue. However, the C89, C99, and C++98 code printers handle the `Max` function differently, possibly involving a manual implementation or another underlying issue. These code spans should be further investigated to identify the root cause of the issue and to ensure the `Max` function is handled appropriately to produce the expected output.",
