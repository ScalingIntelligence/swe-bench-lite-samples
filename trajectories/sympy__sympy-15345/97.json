The expected output is 'Max[x, 2]' but it currently outputs 'Max(x, 2)' which is incorrect for Mathematica. The key task here is to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the printing of 'Max' in the Mathematica code printer. From the search results, 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' contains the 'MCodePrinter' class which is likely responsible for converting SymPy expressions into Mathematica code. There are specific spans within this file that are relevant, such as the class definition itself and the 'MCodePrinter.__init__' method which initializes the printer. However, the most important span to check is 'MCodePrinter._print_Mul' which seems to be handling the printing of multiplications but does not specifically mention 'Max'. Given this, it's plausible that the '_print_Max' method, if it exists in 'MCodePrinter', might be missing or incorrectly implemented. It's also worth noting that the other C and C++ code printers in the results have '_print_Max' methods which might serve as a reference to implement or fix the analogous method in 'MCodePrinter'.",

The search results primarily focus on different code printers, including C89, C99, NumPy, C++, and Tensorflow printers. The relevant code spans are expected to be found within these printers, especially where the `_print_Max` method is defined. It's crucial to review the implementations of `_print_Max` in each printer to identify any discrepancies or incorrect behavior. Given that `Max` is a mathematical function, the focus should be on the `mathematica.py` file and its printers. The current context already provides some relevant spans in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, particularly the `MCodePrinter` class and its methods. The search results extend this by providing additional implementations of `_print_Max` across different printers, which can be crucial for identifying the correct behavior or potential errors in the current implementation in `mathematica.py`.
