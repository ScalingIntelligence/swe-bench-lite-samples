The expected output should be 'Max[x,2]', but the current output is 'Max(2, x)'. To address this, I will focus on identifying sections of the code in the provided search results where the 'Max' function or 'mathematica_code' is handled specifically for Mathematica. I need to ensure that the code output respects Mathematica's syntax for 'Max'. From the search results, the most relevant files appear to be 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' (where 'MCodePrinter' and its methods are defined) and 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' (where 'TensorflowPrinter' and its methods for 'Max' are defined). However, none of these files directly relate to Mathematica. Given the scope, I will focus on 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' for any potential issues or modifications needed. However, upon review, it seems the issue might be more localized or unique to how Mathematica syntax is handled differently from other printers like Tensorflow or CXX. Given the absence of a direct 'MathematicaPrinter' or 'MCodePrinter._print_Max' method in the results, I recommend further investigation into how other printers like 'PythonCodePrinter' or 'NumPyPrinter' might influence the handling of 'Max' with respect to Mathematica's expectations.",
