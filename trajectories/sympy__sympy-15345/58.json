Specifically, the output is `'Max(2, x)'` instead of the expected `'Max[x,2]'`. Based on the provided context, it appears that the `Max` function is being handled in multiple files, including `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, and `sympy/printing/cxxcode.py`. Additionally, the `Max` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py`. To address this, we should focus on the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` and the `_print_Max` methods in the relevant files.",

The analysis revealed the method `_print_Mul` in `MCodePrinter`, but this method doesn't directly handle the `Max` function. Thus, I haven't identified any relevant code span in the provided search results that directly address this issue. The issue might lie in `_print_Max` methods across different `CodePrinter` subclasses that might handle the `Max` function but were not found in the search results due to the code snippet limit on `MCodePrinter`. This means further investigation outside the provided search results or in the methods not shown here might be necessary to fix the issue.",

The expected output should be 'Max[x,2]' for the expression `Max(x,2)`, as per Mathematica's syntax, but the actual output is 'Max(2, x)', which is incorrect. Given the context of the issue, our focus should be on the `mathematica.py` file and the `MCodePrinter` class since this is where the translation to Mathematica code would likely occur. The `MCodePrinter` class contains method definitions for handling various types of expressions, including potentially the `Max` function. By reviewing the `MCodePrinter` class and its related methods, we should be able to identify where the incorrect translation might be happening and validate whether the provided search results are relevant for fixing this issue. If the `_print_Max` method within `MCodePrinter` follows a pattern similar to other code printers but produces an incorrect output, it may need adjustment to ensure it outputs the correct Mathematica syntax.",

However, several files contain relevant `_print_Max` methods in different contexts, suggesting that the issue might be related to how these methods are inherited or overridden in the specific context of Mathematica code generation. The files `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, `sympy/printing/cxxcode.py`, `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, and `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` each have their own implementations of `_print_Max`, but none of these are specific to Mathematica. The most promising file, `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, which contains the `MCodePrinter` class responsible for Mathematica code generation, does not have a `_print_Max` method included in the provided context. This suggests that the `_print_Max` method for Mathematica is either missing or improperly implemented in the `MCodePrinter` class. Given this situation, further investigation is needed to either find the missing `_print_Max` method in the broader `sympy/printing` module or to implement it correctly in the `MCodePrinter` class to ensure proper handling of the `Max` function for Mathematica code generation.",
