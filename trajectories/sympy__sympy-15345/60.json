The expected output should be in the format 'Max[x,2]' but it is incorrectly giving 'Max(2, x)'. This suggests a problem in the `_print_Max` method or the `mathematica_code` function. From the provided file context, it appears that the `_print_Max` method is defined in several files related to code printing, such as `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, `sympy/printing/cxxcode.py`, and `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`. However, the `mathematica_code` function is specifically in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`. Therefore, the initial search should focus on `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` to check the implementation of `_print_Max` and `mathematica_code`.",
