The search results include several files and spans from different printers such as C89CodePrinter, C99CodePrinter, NumPyPrinter, _CXXCodePrinterBase, and TensorflowPrinter. The key spans to focus on are those that define the _print_Max method for each printer, as this method is responsible for converting the Max function to the appropriate code string.

This discrepancy indicates a potential issue with the translation or representation of the Max function in the Mathematica code printer. Given this, it is crucial to identify the relevant code spans that handle the conversion of SymPy's Max function to Mathematica's syntax. In the current context, the `mathematica_code` function in `mathematica.py` seems to be the main entry point for converting SymPy expressions to Mathematica. However, there is no specific code span in the file context related to the `Max` function in Mathematica. The newly found `mathematica_code` function in `mathematica.py` likely utilizes `MCodePrinter` to handle the conversion of SymPy expressions to Mathematica code. Reviewing files such as `ccode.py`, `cxxcode.py`, and `pycode.py` did not reveal any direct handling of Mathematica syntax. Thus, I need to look into the `MCodePrinter` class or its methods to locate the specific implementation responsible for translating `Max` in the context of Mathematica. Given the search results, it appears that the print method for `Max` in the Mathematica printer might be missing or incorrectly implemented. As such, the specific code span where this incorrect output is generated or should be corrected is not yet identified.",

This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the relevant parts of the codebase.\n\nFrom the file context provided, we have identified several relevant spans of code, particularly in the 'sympy/printing/ccode.py' file. This file contains definitions for C code printing, including handling for the Max function. We see that there is a method '_print_Max' in the C89CodePrinter class that deals with the Max function. This method is responsible for generating the appropriate C code for the Max function. However, it does not appear to handle the specific transformation to Mathematica syntax as required by the issue.\n\nIn the 'sympy/printing/cxxcode.py' file, there is also a method '_print_Max' in the _CXXCodePrinterBase class, which is similar in functionality but is for C++ code. This method also needs to be examined in the context of Mathematica code transformation.\n\nIn addition, there are methods '_print_Max' in the 'sympy/printing/pycode.py' file, specifically in the NumPyPrinter class, and in the 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' file, in the TensorflowPrinter class. These methods are intended for different printing contexts but should be checked for any possible implications related to the Max function in Mathematica context.\n\nFinally, the 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' file contains the 'mathematica_code' function, which is the top-level function that would need to be adjusted to correctly format the Max function as specified by the issue.",

Additionally, the `NumPyPrinter`, `TensorflowPrinter`, and `_CXXCodePrinterBase` classes also have methods for printing `Max`. These methods should be examined to ensure they correctly generate Mathematica code. I will focus on the `mathematica_code` function itself and the related methods in the different printers to determine if they need adjustment to produce the correct Mathematica output.

This discrepancy suggests that the `Max` function is not being handled correctly in the Mathematica code printer. The current file context shows code from various printers in the SymPy library, including `C89CodePrinter`, `C99CodePrinter`, `CXX98CodePrinter`, `CXX11CodePrinter`, `CXX17CodePrinter`, `NumPyPrinter`, and `TensorflowPrinter`. These printers handle different coding standards and libraries, but the issue at hand pertains to the Mathematica code printer specifically. The search results provide insights into the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, which is responsible for generating Mathematica code. It appears that the `MCodePrinter` class does not have a specific method for handling the `Max` function, which aligns with the issue reported. It is likely that the `Max` function is being handled generically rather than being specifically tailored for Mathematica's syntax, thus resulting in the incorrect output. The focus should be on implementing or correcting the handling of the `Max` function within the `MCodePrinter` class to ensure it outputs the correct Mathematica syntax using the square brackets expected by Mathematica for the `Max` function.",
