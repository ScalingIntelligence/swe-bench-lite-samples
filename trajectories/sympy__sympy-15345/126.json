The expected output should be 'Max[x,2]' but the actual output is 'Max(2, x)'. This suggests that the function 'Max' is not being correctly converted to Mathematica's syntax in the 'mathematica_code' function. To address this, I need to identify the part of the code responsible for converting 'Max' to Mathematica's syntax and ensure it handles the arguments in the correct order. From the search results, the relevant files are 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py'. In 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py', there is a class 'MCodePrinter' which inherits from 'CodePrinter' and is used in the 'mathematica_code' function to generate code. This class likely contains the method responsible for handling 'Max'. In 'sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py', there is a class 'Max' that inherits from 'MinMaxBase' and 'Application', which likely defines the 'Max' function behavior. Specifically, the method '_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise' in the 'Max' class might be relevant for this issue. However, after examining the search results, it appears that the issue is related to how 'Max' is being handled in 'MCodePrinter'. Therefore, the most relevant part to focus on is the 'MCodePrinter' class and how it handles printing for 'Max'.",

The expected output is `'Max[x,2]'` but the current output is `'Max(2, x)'`. This discrepancy indicates that the Mathematica code printer (`MCodePrinter`) might not be handling the `Max` function correctly. \n\nFrom the current file context, it's clear that `mathematica_code` is defined to use `MCodePrinter`, which inherits from `CodePrinter`. The initial analysis focused on `MCodePrinter` and its methods, including `__init__` and `_print_Mul`. However, the specific issue with the `Max` function was not addressed in these spans, pointing to the need for more specific handling for the `Max` function in the Mathematica code printer.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context, specifically in `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py`, where the `Max` class and its methods are defined. The `Max` class extends `MinMaxBase` and `Application`, and there are specific evaluation methods like `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise`. These methods could be relevant as they define how the `Max` function behaves in different contexts.\n\nTo address the reported issue, it's essential to ensure that the `Max` function is correctly translated into Mathematica code. This involves both understanding the `Max` function's internal behavior and implementing or adjusting the `MCodePrinter` to output the correct Mathematica syntax. The relevant spans from the new search results highlight the `Max` class and its methods, which are crucial for understanding and possibly modifying how the `Max` function is handled by the code printer.",
