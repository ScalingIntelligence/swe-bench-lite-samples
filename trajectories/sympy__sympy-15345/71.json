            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that the 'mathematica_code' function is not producing the expected output for the 'Max' function when converting Python code to Mathematica code. The expected output is 'Max[x,2]' but the actual output is 'Max(2, x)'. To address this, we need to look into the implementation of the 'mathematica_code' function and the 'MCodePrinter' class which it utilizes for code generation. From the provided search results, we observe that the 'mathematica_code' function simply passes the expression and settings to an instance of 'MCodePrinter' and calls 'doprint' on it. Consequently, the 'MCodePrinter' class is where the actual conversion logic resides. It includes methods like '_print_Mul' which handle specific types of expressions. The issue likely stems from the logic within these methods, specifically the handling of the 'Max' function. Identifying the relevant spans in 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' that deal with 'Max' or general function printing will help in fixing this issue. However, the search results do not directly show the handling of 'Max' or how functions are converted to Mathematica syntax. To fully address the issue, further investigation into the 'MCodePrinter' class and its methods is necessary, possibly including more specific handling for 'Max' or a general review of function printing.",
