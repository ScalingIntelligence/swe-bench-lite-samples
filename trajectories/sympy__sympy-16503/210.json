Additionally, the _print_Add method also deals with the pretty printing of addition expressions, which could interact with the Sum pretty print output. The issue is likely related to the asum function or the stacking and alignment logic in the _print_Sum method. Further, although the Sum class is included in the context, it is not directly involved in the pretty printing functionality that is central to this issue.
