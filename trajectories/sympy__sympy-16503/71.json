This suggests that the alignment handling in the pretty print function might be off. To find the relevant code, we should look into files related to pretty printing, especially those handling Sum and Add expressions, as these are likely to contain the relevant alignment logic. Additionally, considering the problem involves both 'x' and '+ 3', it's likely that both Sum and Add are involved in the misalignment.",

The <issue> mentions that the 'x' and the '+ 3' should be aligned, implying that the relevant code spans to look for are those that handle the pretty printing of Sum objects and the alignment of elements within the summation expression. \n\nIn the <search_results>, there are several relevant spans of code in the 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' file, particularly in the PrettyPrinter class. The '_print_Sum' method is the most relevant as it contains logic for rendering the Sum object in a pretty format. Within this method, there is a function 'asum' that is responsible for formatting the summation, including potentially the alignment of the 'x' and the '+ 3'. Looking at the 'adjust' function within 'asum', it appears to handle alignment of strings, which could be used to address the misalignment issue. \n\nAdditionally, the 'sympy/concrete/summations.py' file contains the Sum class definition and related methods, but these are more about the mathematical operations and properties of the Sum object rather than its rendering/pretty print representation. Therefore, the focus should remain on the 'pretty.py' file and the '_print_Sum' method specifically.\n\nConsidering this analysis, I will select the identified spans from 'pretty.py' as they directly relate to rendering and aligning the Sum object in the pretty print output.",
