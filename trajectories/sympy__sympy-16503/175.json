The <search_results> tag provides several file contexts with code spans, so I'll go through each file to find the relevant code spans. The sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file seems particularly relevant, as it contains a class PrettyPrinter with methods _print_Sum. I will examine the _print_Sum method as it deals directly with the Sum object and its pretty print representation. Within this method, I'm paying close attention to the parts dealing with alignment and specific string manipulations, as these are directly related to the centering issue. I'll extract the relevant code spans for further review and identify other potentially related sections. The latex.py and mathml.py files contain _print_Sum methods as well, but they deal with LaTeX and MathML formatting, respectively, which are not directly related to the pretty print issue. Although these files include _print_Sum methods, they focus on different output formats and are less relevant to the pretty print alignment issue, so I will skip them. Similarly, the stringpict.py file deals with string pict representation, but its content pertains more to the general structure and operations on string pict objects rather than specific alignment issues in the Sum pretty print. I will not select these spans for the current issue, as they don't directly address the alignment problem in the pretty print of Sum.",
