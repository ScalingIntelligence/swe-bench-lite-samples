This suggests a need to adjust the alignment or centering logic in the pretty printing functionality. The search results provide relevant code spans that handle the pretty printing of Sum expressions. Specifically, the 'PrettyPrinter._print_Sum' method is responsible for formatting the Sum expression into a pretty form. Within this method, there are parts that handle the alignment and stacking of the upper and lower limits of the Sum, as well as the main function. Key areas to focus on include the 'asum' function, which constructs the summation symbol's visual representation, and the part where the prettySign is constructed and combined with prettyUpper and prettyLower.
