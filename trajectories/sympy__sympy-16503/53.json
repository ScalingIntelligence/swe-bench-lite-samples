The file 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' contains the relevant 'PrettyPrinter' class which is responsible for the pretty printing of SymPy expressions. Specifically, the '_print_Sum' method within this class is critical as it deals with the pretty printing of summation expressions, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'sympy/concrete/summations.py' file contains the 'Sum' class which defines the summation expressions and behaviors. Despite there being no direct code span specifically aligning 'x' and '+ 3', the relevant methods under 'PrettyPrinter' and 'Sum' are identified as highly pertinent to addressing the issue.

The `_print_Sum` method currently centers the summation symbol according to the height of the rendered function and bounds. To address the alignment issue of additional terms, the interaction between `_print_Sum` and other print methods, particularly `_print_Add`, needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure that additional terms like ' + 3' are aligned neatly with the summation symbol.
