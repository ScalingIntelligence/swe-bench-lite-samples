Upon analyzing the search results, particularly the 'PrettyPrinter' class and its '_print_Sum' method, it becomes clear that this method is responsible for rendering the summation symbol (\u03a3) along with its bounds and the expression underneath. The main focus for addressing the issue should be on the '_print_Sum' method, where the alignment mechanics for the Sum's expression and its bounds are defined. Specifically, the alignment issue might stem from the asum function and how it computes and adjusts the lines of the summation symbol and its bounds. Additionally, since the 'x' and '+ 3' are part of the expression being summed, understanding how the '_print_Add' method handles the rendering of Add expressions might also be beneficial for debugging or adjusting the alignment. Therefore, focusing on enhancing the asum function's adjustment logic or possibly reevaluating how the entire prettyF form is constructed in '_print_Sum' might lead to a solution for the reported alignment issue.",
