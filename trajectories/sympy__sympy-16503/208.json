This method is responsible for formatting the Sum expression in a pretty print manner. Specifically, the method uses an 'asum' function to adjust the alignment of the summation components. This function is likely where adjustments need to be made to ensure proper alignment. Other methods in the same file, such as '_print_Add', '_print_Integral', and '_print_Product', might also be relevant as they handle alignment and formatting for other mathematical expressions which could influence the Sum's display. Additionally, the 'prettyForm' class in 'sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py' is used for managing the layout of pretty printed expressions, including alignment, which might need to be looked into for a comprehensive solution.",
