This specifically relates to the pretty printing functionality, which is likely implemented across several printer classes in the codebase. Given the nature of the issue, the focus should be on the code spans that handle the pretty printing of Sum expressions. Among the search results, the most relevant class appears to be 'LatexPrinter' in 'sympy/printing/latex.py', especially the '_print_Sum' method. This method constructs the LaTeX representation of Sum expressions and thus is directly relevant to the issue at hand. Other printer classes like 'MCodePrinter', 'MathMLContentPrinter', 'MathMLPresentationPrinter', 'AbstractPythonCodePrinter', and 'StrPrinter' also have '_print_Sum' methods, but 'LatexPrinter' is likely the most pertinent as it relates to LaTeX formatting directly. Therefore, the identified code spans from 'LatexPrinter' are expected to contain the necessary context to address the alignment issue in the pretty print output.",

The focus should be on the `PrettyPrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file because it deals directly with the pretty-printing of mathematical expressions, including sums. The relevant code span is the `_print_Sum` method within the `PrettyPrinter` class. This method handles the pretty-printing of sums (`Sum` objects) and involves the alignment of the terms in the sum. The code span we identified adjusts the alignment of the sum's components by managing their vertical and horizontal placement. Analyzing the `_print_Sum` method in the context of the reported issue shows that it is attempting to align the summands with the sum symbol and its limits. The search results also include other printers like LaTeX, Str, Python, and Mathematica printers which might be good for understanding the overall printing mechanism but are not directly relevant to the misalignment issue stated. The relevant code span in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` is the `_print_Sum` method, which handles the alignment logic for pretty printing sums.",
