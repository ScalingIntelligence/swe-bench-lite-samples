Given the files provided, it's evident that the pretty printing functionality for sums is spread across multiple files, such as 'pretty.py', 'latex.py', 'mathml.py', etc. The immediate focus should be on the pretty printer for sums in 'pretty.py' and potentially on 'stringpict.py' as it seems related to string formatting. Additionally, 'summations.py' might be relevant as it directly deals with sums. Given the diversity of printing methods possibly involved, multiple search strategies are necessary.",

Furthermore, 'summations.py' is given, which contributes indirectly to the print representation but does not directly deal with the alignment topic. Based on the presence of a relevant section in 'pretty.py' that deals with formatting sums and the absence of alignment concerns in 'summations.py', the provided file context seems strategically important yet incomplete in directly fixing the reported alignment issue.

The method uses specific formatting functions like 'asum' for managing the alignment of the sum representation. The alignment of the 'x' in the sum and the '+ 3' should be carefully adjusted within the '_print_Sum' function. Potential issues might arise from the handling of upper and lower limits, or from the placement of the sum symbol itself. Additionally, the relationship between the elements within the sum (like 'x' and '+ 3') and their baselines could be scrutinized for necessary modifications. The 'adjust' function within 'asum' could be particularly relevant for alignment correction, and exploring different alignment parameters in that context might yield improvements for consistency. Furthermore, since the representation of sums can vary significantly between ASCII and Unicode modes, ensuring consistent adjustments across these modes is crucial. Adjacent functions in 'pretty.py' that influence string layout, such as those handling other mathematical expressions like products or limits, could also indirectly affect the layout of sum representations.",

The provided file context and search results primarily focus on the PrettyPrinter class within the sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file, which is responsible for rendering mathematical expressions into a pretty-printed format. The relevant code spans identified in the search results include the _print_Sum method within the PrettyPrinter class. This method is crucial for handling the pretty-printing of Sum objects, and it appears to be where the alignment adjustments for the summation symbol and its bounds are managed. The method `asum` is used to format the summation symbol and its bounds, and the alignment of the 'F' (which likely represents the function being summed) is adjusted relative to the summation symbol. This method may require adjustments to properly align 'x' and '+ 3'. The stringPict class from the sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py file is also included in the search results, which is used for string formatting and alignment in the pretty printing process. The stack method in particular is used for stacking string elements vertically, which could be relevant for arranging the 'x' and '+ 3' properly. Since the identified code spans directly address the issue of aligning the 'x' and the '+ 3' in the pretty printed output of a Sum, they are considered relevant to the reported issue and should suffice for addressing it.",
