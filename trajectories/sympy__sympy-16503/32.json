Upon analyzing the provided search results, several code spans appear relevant to addressing this issue. In particular, the `_print_Sum` method within the `PrettyPrinter` class is responsible for pretty printing the summation (Sum) symbol. This method constructs the pretty printed representation by stacking the upper and lower bounds above and below the summation symbol. It is within this method where the alignment of the components mentioned in the issue (like `x` and `+ 3`) is decided. The method `_print_Add` also seems relevant as it handles the pretty printing of addition expressions, which includes the alignment of summands. The `prettyForm` class, which handles the rendering of pretty printed objects, also plays a crucial role in alignment issues, especially the `__add__` method that combines multiple pretty forms. Therefore, these code spans appear highly relevant to resolving the centering issue described in the report by offering the logic used to construct pretty printed representations in Python.",
