Specifically, the section '_print_Sum' method is focused on printing the Sum expression. This method contains logic to adjust the alignment of the summation sign and its bounds, which could be relevant to fixing the alignment issue described in the reported issue. The 'asum' function within '_print_Sum' is particularly relevant as it handles the alignment of the summation bounds and the summation sign itself. This suggests that modifications to the alignment logic in this function might be necessary to solve the reported issue.
