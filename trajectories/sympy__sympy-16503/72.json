This suggests that the relevant code would involve the pretty printing of the Sum and potentially the Add function since the '+ 3' is part of an addition operation. From the search results, the 'PrettyPrinter' class in 'pretty.py' contains methods '_print_Sum' and '_print_Add' which directly deal with the pretty printing of these functions. The '_print_Sum' method includes code responsible for formatting the summation symbol and its bounds, and it makes adjustments to the alignment of the elements. The '_print_Add' method includes code for handling the addition of terms, which could also be relevant for the alignment issue if the '+ 3' term is part of a larger addition operation. Therefore, both methods are likely relevant to addressing the reported centering issue.",
