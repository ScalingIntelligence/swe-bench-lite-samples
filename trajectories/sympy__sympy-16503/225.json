The issue specifically points out that the alignment of 'x' and '+ 3' is incorrect. This alignment issue would likely be handled in the pretty printer classes or functions related to Sum expression formatting. From the provided search results, there are relevant sections in both latex.py and pretty.py that deal with the rendering of Sum expressions, particularly the LatexPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes. These classes contain methods like _print_Sum, which are directly involved in formatting Sum expressions for output. Additionally, the Sum class itself in summations.py provides the core functionality for summation, but it doesn't directly address the alignment issue in the pretty print. The focus should therefore be on the printing modules that handle the actual formatting and alignment in the output.",
