Given the context of the PrettyPrinter class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, it is likely that the method `_print_Sum` is responsible for rendering the Sum in pretty print format. Additionally, since the issue involves how the '+' is printed in the context of a summation, it is also relevant to look at how Add is handled. Specifically, the method `_print_Add` within the same file could include the logic for handling the addition operation in the context of pretty print. Furthermore, the other files might contain related functions if the printing logic is distributed across different modules, especially in the latex and mathml printers where there are also `_print_Sum` functions.",

The relevant code spans should include logic that handles the pretty printing of sums and additions, as well as alignment. The file `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains two key methods, `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add`, that are responsible for handling these operations. In `_print_Sum`, there is a block of code that adjusts the alignment of the sum symbol, lower limit, upper limit, and the expression being summed. This block likely contains the logic for aligning 'x' and '+ 3'. Similarly, `_print_Add` handles the pretty printing of addition operations, which may influence the alignment of added terms such as '+ 3'. These two methods are identified as crucial for resolving the misalignment issue.",
