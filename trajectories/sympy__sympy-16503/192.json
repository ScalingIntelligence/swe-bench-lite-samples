Within this method, the 'asum' function handles the printing of the summation symbol and its limits. The 'adjust' function within 'asum' likely needs to be fine-tuned to address the centering issue. Additionally, the code where 'prettyF' is adjusted for baselines and bindings hints at how the final alignment might be affected.
