The method uses the `asum` function to format the summation symbols and their alignment. Specifically, the `adjust` function within `asum` is responsible for handling the padding of these symbols to ensure they are properly spaced and aligned. However, the current implementation does not explicitly address the alignment issue between the summand and the subsequent addition part ('+ 3'). We need to ensure that the alignment logic in the `adjust` function and the broader context in which summation symbols are placed considers the alignment of the addition part and the summand correctly. Furthermore, as part of ensuring consistency and correctness across different print formats, we should also review similar methods for Sum in `latex.py` and `mathml.py`.",
            "search_suggestions": "Review the _print_Sum method in `pretty.py` and explore similar methods for Sum in `latex.py` and `mathml.py` to ensure consistent alignment handling across different print formats."
