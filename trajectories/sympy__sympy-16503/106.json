Upon examining the search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are located within the 'PrettyPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py'. The method '_print_Sum' is particularly pertinent as it handles the pretty printing of the 'Sum' expression. This method includes a detailed implementation of how the summation symbol, upper and lower limits, and the function to be summed are combined and aligned. The issue of centering 'x' and '+ 3' likely involves tweaking the alignment logic within this method, particularly the 'adjust' function and how it aligns the components of the summation expression. Additionally, understanding and potentially modifying the loop that constructs the horizontal summation symbol and adjusts the alignment of the function being summed are critical. Since the current file context does not identify any relevant code yet, the identified spans focus on the '_print_Sum' method. No parts appear redundant based on the issue description. Therefore, the analyzed code spans should provide a strong starting point for addressing the reported centering issue in the pretty print of the 'Sum' expression.",

Within this method, the alignment is controlled by the `asum` function, which constructs the pretty representation of the summation sign. It adjusts the alignment of the summation limits based on the height requirement of the summand (F in the code). The search results for other printing formats (LaTeX and MathML) are not directly relevant to the issue at hand, which specifically pertains to the pretty-printed format. Therefore, to address the alignment issue, one would need to modify the `asum` function's logic or the alignment adjustment within the `_print_Sum` method.",

The provided file context shows the implementation of '_print_Sum'. The method contains logic to handle the alignment of the summation symbol with its bounds and the expression being summed. Based on this, it seems that the alignment issue might be either in the asum function, which constructs the lines for the summation symbol, or in the final composition of these lines with the expression and its bounds. Additionally, since LaTeX and MathML representations might have different alignment concerns, investigating 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/printing/mathml.py' for corresponding '_print_Sum' methods could be beneficial.",
