This suggests that the problem is related to the pretty printer's handling of Sum and Add expressions. The search results include two files:\n\n1. `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` - This file contains the `PrettyPrinter` class, which is responsible for pretty printing SymPy expressions. Specifically, there are two methods `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` that are relevant to the issue. The `_print_Sum` method includes logic for adjusting the alignment of the summation expression, and the `_print_Add` method handles the addition of terms, which could include the addition of the `+ 3` term.\n\n2. `sympy/concrete/summations.py` - This file defines the `Sum` class, which represents a summation expression in SymPy. Although this class is related to the Sum expression, the issue at hand is not directly related to the logic of the Sum class but rather how it is printed. Therefore, the relevant code spans are found in `pretty.py`.\n\nTo address the reported issue, the focus should be on the `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods in `pretty.py`. These methods should be inspected to ensure proper alignment of the `x` and `+ 3` in the pretty print output.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are from `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, specifically the spans tagged with `PrettyPrinter._print_Sum` and `PrettyPrinter._print_Add`, as these are directly responsible for the pretty printing of Sum and Add expressions respectively.",
