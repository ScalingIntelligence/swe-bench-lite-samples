The key functions to examine are _print_Sum and _print_Add in the PrettyPrinter class within the sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file. These functions handle the pretty printing of Sum and Add objects, respectively. Additionally, it's important to consider the Sum class in sympy/concrete/summations.py as it directly deals with the summation logic. The analysis shows that the _print_Sum function in PrettyPrinter currently adjusts the alignment of elements in the summation, but the specific issue of alignment might require fine-tuning within this function. The _print_Add function is also relevant for understanding how the '+' operator is handled in the pretty print, which might impact the vertical alignment with the 'x'. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue of bad centering in the pretty print output for Sum objects.",
