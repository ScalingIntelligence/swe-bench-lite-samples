The search results include several files related to different types of printers, but the focus should be on the PrettyPrinter class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` since it deals directly with the pretty printing of expressions. Specifically, the `_print_Sum` method in the PrettyPrinter class is responsible for formatting Sum expressions, which is directly related to the issue. Within this method, the function `asum` is used to generate the pretty printing for the sum expression and involves adjusting the alignment. The relevant code spans are those that involve the `_print_Sum` method and the `asum` function, which handle the formatting and alignment of the sum expression, including the upper and lower limits and the summand itself. By examining these spans, the relevant code can be identified to address the alignment issue mentioned in the reported issue.",
