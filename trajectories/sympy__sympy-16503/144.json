In the provided file context, the `_print_Sum` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the relevant code for handling the pretty printing of summations, including the alignment of the summation symbol with the inline components. The method already involves logic for adjusting the alignment based on the height of the components, suggesting that this code should be further modified to address the specific alignment issue described. The `stringpict.py` module is referenced within the `_print_Sum` method, indicating that it might also be relevant but is not explicitly included in the file context. Overall, the provided file context seems sufficient to make the necessary adjustments to address the centering issue in the summation pretty print.",
