The relevant code spans can be identified primarily in the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file, focusing on the `PrettyPrinter` class methods. The key methods to analyze are `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add`, as they deal directly with the rendering of summation and addition expressions, respectively. The `_print_Sum` method contains logic for rendering the summation sign with its bounds, and alignment adjustments can be found within this method. The `_print_Add` method is also important for understanding how the additional term is being processed and rendered in the pretty print output. These methods include detailed code for handling the alignment and formatting of these mathematical expressions. By examining these methods, we can identify the specific code where adjustments may be needed to better align the 'x' and the '+ 3' in the output.",

The new search results reintroduce these spans but also include a new span for the `_print_Mul` method. Based on the issue, alignment problems in summation and addition are crucial, so the relevant spans are those handling these operations. However, the `_print_Mul` method, although related to arithmetic operations, does not directly address the centering issue in the context of summation symbols.
