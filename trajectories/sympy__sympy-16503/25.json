Given the specific concern about aligning the variable `x` and the term `+ 3` correctly, the focus should be on the methods and logic within the pretty print functions, particularly those that handle summations (`_print_Sum`) and additions (`_print_Add`). The suitable files to investigate would be `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, `sympy/printing/latex.py`, and `sympy/printing/mathml.py`, as these contain implementations related to pretty printing various mathematical expressions, including summations. The primary focus for alignment adjustments would be within the `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods in these files.",

The code spans in the search results provide the necessary context to address this issue. I identified the relevant code spans (span_ids 'PrettyPrinter._print_Sum' and 'PrettyPrinter._print_Add') that handle the pretty printing of Sum and Add expressions, respectively. Inside 'PrettyPrinter._print_Sum', the method 'asum' is responsible for constructing the pretty print of the summation symbol and its limits. The method 'adjust' is used for adjusting the alignment of strings, which might be relevant for aligning 'x' and '+ 3'. Inside 'PrettyPrinter._print_Add', there are methods for handling the printing of addition terms, including adjustments for negative numbers and rational numbers. These methods might be relevant for handling the '+ 3' part of the Sum output. The search results are relevant and complete to address the reported issue.",
