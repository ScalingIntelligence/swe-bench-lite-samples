This method is responsible for pretty printing the 'Sum' expression. Within this method, there are functions and logic that handle the alignment of the summation symbols and expressions. The method '_print_Sum' defines a function 'asum' that is used to create the pretty printing for the summation symbol and adjust the alignment of the lower and upper limits. The code also adjusts the baseline of the elements to align them properly.
