Upon examining the provided search results, a deep dive into the `PrettyPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` reveals the relevant code handling the pretty printing of `Sum` objects. The method `_print_Sum` is responsible for formatting the sum expression, including the alignment of elements. Notably, it adjusts the alignment based on the height and width of the upper and lower bounds of the sum, and then combines these with the function being summed. The method uses helper functions like `asum` to prepare the alignment of the summation symbol and its bounds. This code directly addresses the issue by controlling the alignment of the elements within the pretty printed sum. Therefore, the identified spans are crucial for solving the reported issue.",
