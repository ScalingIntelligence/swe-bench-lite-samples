To address this, we need to look into the code responsible for pretty printing Sum objects. From the search results, the most relevant code span is found in the '_print_Sum' method within the 'PrettyPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py'. This method is specifically designed to handle the pretty printing of Sum expressions. It includes logic for aligning the summand with the limits of the sum, which seems relevant to the reported issue. The other search results are less relevant, as they pertain to LaTeX and MathML printing, which are different formats and not directly related to the pretty print issue. Therefore, I identify the '_print_Sum' method in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' as the relevant code span to address the centering issue in the pretty print output.",
