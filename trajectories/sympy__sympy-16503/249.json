            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported is about the misalignment of the `x` and `+ 3` in the pretty print of a Sum expression. The key parts of the reported issue are centered around the printing and alignment of mathematical expressions, specifically involving the `Sum` and `Add` classes in the sympy library. Since the task involves aligning the parts of the pretty print output, the focus should be on the PrettyPrinter class and its associated methods that handle the pretty print representation of expressions.\n\nFrom the search results, several relevant code spans are identified:\n\n1. The `PrettyPrinter` class definition and its methods `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. These methods are directly responsible for the pretty print representation of Sum and Add expressions respectively.\n2. The `Sum` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `doit`, and others in `sympy/concrete/summations.py`. While these methods are more about the logic of the Sum object itself rather than its pretty print representation, understanding their structure can provide context that might influence the pretty print output.\n3. Similar `_print_Add` and `_print_Sum` methods in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/mathml.py` show how Add and Sum are handled in other printing formats, which might provide insights into how alignment is treated differently in those contexts.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the search results, the relevant code spans to address the misalignment in pretty print output are within the `PrettyPrinter` class's `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods, as these explicitly control the visual representation of Sum and Add expressions in the pretty print format. Therefore, the identified spans within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` are crucial for addressing the issue.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the search results and how they relate to the reported issue, it is confirmed that the provided search results contain the necessary code spans to address the misalignment issue in the pretty print output of a Sum expression. The focus should primarily be on modifying or enhancing the `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods to ensure the correct alignment of elements in the output.",
