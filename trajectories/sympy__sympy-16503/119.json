To address this, we need to find the relevant code spans responsible for rendering the Sum and Add operations in the pretty printer. The search results provided include files from the sympy library, specifically focusing on the pretty printing and summation functionalities. In 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', we find relevant spans for PrettyPrinter, which includes methods for printing Sum and Add expressions: '_print_Sum' and '_print_Add'. These methods contain logic for rendering the Sum and Add expressions, including adjustments for alignment. In 'sympy/concrete/summations.py', the Sum class and its methods are found, but these are more about the mathematical computation of sums rather than their pretty printing. The most relevant code spans for the reported issue are in the '_print_Sum' and '_print_Add' methods within 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', as these directly handle the formatting and alignment of the Sum and Add expressions for pretty printing. These code spans should be enough to understand and potentially modify the alignment behavior of 'x' and '+ 3' within the pretty printed Sum expression.",
