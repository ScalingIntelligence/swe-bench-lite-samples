The `x` and the `+ 3` should be aligned, but it's unclear whether the `x` should be lower or if the `+ 3` should be higher. The relevant files seem to be the ones dealing with pretty printing and especially those that handle Sum expressions. First, I should search for the `_print_Sum` method across different files that handle pretty printing. Then, I might need to see how the `_print_Add` method is handling the alignment for the `+ 3` part. It might also be useful to look into the `prettyForm` class if it involves string formatting that could affect alignment.",

The key points are the alignment of 'x' and '+ 3' within the Sum expression. The relevant files to analyze for this issue are those dealing with pretty printing, particularly those handling Sum and Add expressions. Among the search results, `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the `PrettyPrinter` class which has methods `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` that are directly related to the pretty print representation of Sum and Add expressions respectively. These methods show the logic for pretty printing these expressions, including handling alignment and spacing which is directly relevant to the reported issue. To address the issue, the `_print_Sum` method in `PrettyPrinter` would be the starting point for adjusting how the summation expression and the added constant are displayed in order to achieve correct alignment. Therefore, the identified code spans are indeed relevant to the reported issue as they are responsible for the current alignment and formatting in the pretty print output.",
