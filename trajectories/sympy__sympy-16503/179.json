The key concern is ensuring that the 'x' and the '+ 3' are aligned properly. Given the provided context, the focus should be on the PrettyPrinter class within the pretty.py file, particularly the _print_Sum method, as it deals directly with the rendering of Sum objects. Additionally, considering the LaTeX and MathML representations, exploring the _print_Sum methods in latex.py and mathml.py might also be relevant to understand how different print formats handle Sum objects. To further refine the search, it's also useful to examine the Sum class in concrete/summations.py to understand its internal structure and how it interacts with the PrettyPrinter.",

This indicates that the alignment logic in the pretty printer for Sum expressions needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted. The search results show several relevant sections, particularly in `pretty.py`, `latex.py`, and `mathml.py`, which contain the implementations for the pretty printer, LaTeX printer, and MathML printers, respectively. Specifically, the `PrettyPrinter._print_Sum` method in `pretty.py` contains logic for formatting the Sum expression in a pretty way, including the method `asum` which deals with the alignment. This is the most directly related code to the issue. Additionally, the `Sum` class in `summations.py` provides the foundational structure for Sum expressions in the codebase, but the primary focus should be on the pretty printing logic in `pretty.py` to address the alignment issue.",
