The relevant code spans are within the `PrettyPrinter` class, specifically in the `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods.

The `_print_Sum` method constructs the pretty form for the Sum expression, including the handling of alignment for the summation sign and its boundaries. The `_print_Add` method handles the addition of terms, including alignment of negative signs and rational numbers. The alignment issue likely stems from the `adjust` function and the way baselines are managed during the construction of the pretty form.
