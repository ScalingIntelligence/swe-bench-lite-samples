This is because the issue pertains to the pretty printing functionality, which is handled by this class specifically for types like 'Sum' and 'Add'. The _print_Sum method within this class is the primary suspect, as it controls how the 'Sum' is formatted and rendered. Additionally, the _print_Add method could also be relevant if the 'Sum' contains an 'Add' type as a function argument. Looking at the code spans provided, the _print_Sum method within the PrettyPrinter class does handle the rendering of the summation sign and its limits, as well as the placement of the function being summed. It uses the 'prettyForm' object to manage and align these elements. The _print_Add method, though not the direct focus of the report, is included for completeness, as it could still be indirectly relevant to the display of summations that involve addition within their function. \n\nFrom the analysis of the provided code spans and the reported issue, it is clear that the relevant code spans are those in the PrettyPrinter class, specifically the _print_Sum method. This method directly aligns with the problem of centering, as it manages the layout of the summation symbol, its limits, and the function part.

Specifically, the `asum` function is used to handle the alignment of the summation symbol (`\u2211`) with its limits. This function constructs the pretty print for the summation symbol and its bounds, calculating the necessary adjustments using the `adjust` function. It is the `adjust` function that ensures the correct alignment of the elements within the summation symbol. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle aligning the summation's inner terms (like `x` in \u03a3x) with additional terms outside the summation (like `+ 3`). To solve the alignment issue, it may be necessary to adjust the baseline or alignment within the `prettyF` structure after constructing the summation symbol using `asum`. Additionally, other methods like `_print_Add` must be examined to ensure the alignment is consistent across all elements in the expression.",

The relevant code spans from the PrettyPrinter class in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' which includes methods for _print_Sum and _print_Add. The _print_Sum method is especially relevant as it deals with the pretty printing of sums, including the alignment of elements. The code provides a detailed way to adjust and align the parts of the summation when printed. Specifically, the 'asum' function in _print_Sum handles the alignment of upper and lower parts of the summation, and modifications to this part of the code are likely necessary to solve the alignment issue mentioned in the reported issue. The additional search results from other files such as 'latex.py', 'mathematica.py', 'mathml.py', 'pycode.py', and 'str.py' show how the Sum function is handled in different printing formats, confirming the central role of 'pretty.py' in handling the pretty printing, especially for the ASCII and Unicode modes. Based on the analysis, the task is focused on improving the alignment in the pretty print of the Sum function, as indicated in the PrettyPrinter._print_Sum method.",
