To address this, I need to find the relevant code responsible for rendering the 'Sum' function in pretty print format. The most relevant file appears to be 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', which contains the 'PrettyPrinter' class and its '_print_Sum' method. This method is directly responsible for rendering the 'Sum' function in pretty print format, and it includes logic for handling the alignment of the parts of the summation. Other files such as 'sympy/printing/latex.py', 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py', 'sympy/printing/mathml.py', 'sympy/printing/pycode.py', and 'sympy/printing/str.py' also contain '_print_Sum' methods, but since the issue is about pretty print aesthetics, the focus should remain on 'pretty.py'.\n\nThe '_print_Sum' method in 'pretty.py' contains detailed logic for formulating the pretty print representation of the 'Sum' function. It handles the formatting of the summation symbol, the limits of summation, and the summand. The code includes specific handling for ASCII and Unicode modes, which is relevant to the alignment issue mentioned in the reported issue. The alignment issues might be addressed in the lines that determine the placement of the summation symbol relative to its limits and the summand.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will identify the specific spans of code in 'pretty.py' that are relevant to the alignment of the 'Sum' pretty print as requested.",
