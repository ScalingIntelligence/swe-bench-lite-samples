The `_print_Sum` method specifically deals with the pretty printing of summation expressions. This method contains logic for formatting the summation symbol and aligning the upper and lower limits of the sum. Given the issue, modifying the `_print_Sum` method might be necessary to adjust the alignment of the terms. Additionally, the `_print_Add` method may be relevant since it deals with the pretty printing of addition expressions which could affect the alignment of the '+ 3'.
