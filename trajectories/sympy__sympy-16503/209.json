This method is responsible for formatting the Sum expression and handling its alignment in the pretty print output. Other code spans in the search results, such as those in `mathml.py`, `latex.py`, `str.py`, `pycode.py`, and `mathematica.py`, are related to different print formats and do not directly address the alignment issue in the pretty print output.",
