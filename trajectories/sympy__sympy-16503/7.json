Specifically, the method adjusts the alignment of the sum symbol with the expression it encapsulates. The code for _print_Sum includes logic for adjusting the alignment based on ASCII and Unicode modes. This method seems to be directly relevant to the reported issue as it handles the pretty printing of the Sum, including the alignment of the summand and the bounds.

Currently, the method uses the 'asum' function to manage the vertical alignment and spacing of the Sum expression.
