The focus was primarily on the `_print_Sum` method in the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file, as it contains the logic for pretty printing the Sum expression. This method is crucial because it handles the alignment of elements in the printed output. Within the `_print_Sum` method, the function `asum` is responsible for adjusting the alignment of elements such as 'x' and '+ 3'. This function checks the alignment based on the mode (ascii or unicode) and adjusts the prettyForm accordingly. The alignment issue reported can be possibly addressed in this part of the code by reviewing the vertical and horizontal spacing in the printed output. However, there were no direct mentions of how 'x' and '+ 3' are currently aligned or suggestions for their new alignment in the provided spans. It seems that detailed logic handling alignment within the sum printer method should continue to be reviewed and possibly altered. Based on the search results, I have identified the relevant spans that are likely involved in handling this alignment issue.",
