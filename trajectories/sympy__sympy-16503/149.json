The reported issue is specifically about aligning 'x' and '+3' at the same height in the pretty print output.

Given the complexity of reproducing the context for the changes, and ensuring they are correct without breaking other pieces of the code or alignment within similar methods like _print_Add, the correct approach is to modify the asum function to ensure alignment is corrected appropriately.",
