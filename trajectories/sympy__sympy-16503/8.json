From the search results, the section '_print_Sum' is directly related to the pretty printing of Sum expressions. Within this section, there are functions dealing with adjustments for alignment ('asum' function and 'adjust' function within it). I will extract these spans as they are highly relevant to the reported issue of centering in the pretty print output. Additionally, I will note that '_print_Add' handles printing of Add expressions, which is indirectly relevant since it might handle the '+ 3' part of the expression.
