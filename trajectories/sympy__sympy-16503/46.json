Specifically, I analyzed the '_print_Sum' method, which handles the pretty printing of summation expressions. The method constructs the summation sign and aligns the upper and lower limits around it. To ensure the proper alignment of 'x' and '+ 3', I looked for code spans that might affect the positioning and alignment of these elements. Given the complexity of the code and the need to see the entire section to ensure accurate decision-making, I reviewed each relevant part carefully. The '_print_Sum' method contains logic to adjust the baseline and positioning of the summation sign and its limits, which is critical for the alignment issue mentioned. Additionally, I examined the 'prettyForm' class in the 'stringpict.py' file to understand how elements like the summation sign and its components are constructed and manipulated. Since the issue involves alignment between 'x' and '+ 3', understanding the entire section's code around the '_print_Sum' method was imperative. Also, the 'prettyForm' class methods such as '__add__', '__mul__', etc., are necessary to see how mathematical expressions involving additions and multiplications (like '+ 3' in the 'Sum' example) are handled and displayed.",
