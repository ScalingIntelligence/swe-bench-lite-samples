To address this, we need to look into the PrettyPrinter class in the 'printing/pretty/pretty.py' file, which handles the pretty printing of mathematical expressions. The `_print_Sum` method in this class is responsible for the pretty print representation of the Sum expression. The `adjust` function within this method is used to format the printed output. Based on the issue, the relevant code spans are those that directly manipulate or influence the formatting of the Sum expression's output. Therefore, the code span containing the `adjust` function within the `_print_Sum` method is relevant for solving the issue. Additionally, since the Sum class in 'concrete/summations.py' defines the Sum expression itself, understanding its structure and how it interacts with the PrettyPrinter is also valuable. For now, focusing on the PrettyPrinter's handling of the Sum expression in the pretty print output is sufficient.",
