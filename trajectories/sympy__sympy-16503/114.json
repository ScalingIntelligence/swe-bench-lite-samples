The analysis of the search results shows that the 'PrettyPrinter' class is crucial for handling the pretty printing of various SymPy expressions, including Sum and Add. The '_print_Sum' method specifically addresses the printing of Sum expressions, containing logic for adjusting the alignment and formatting of the summands. The '_print_Add' method, on the other hand, handles the printing of Add expressions, including the alignment of terms in sums. These methods encapsulate the core functionalities directly related to the issue at hand, warranting further investigation and potential adjustments to ensure proper alignment and formatting of mathematical expressions in the pretty print output.",
