Upon analyzing the search results, the code spans within 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' that handle the pretty printing of Sum expressions are identified as relevant. Specifically, the _print_Sum method in the PrettyPrinter class contains the logic for formatting the Sum expression. This method adjusts the alignment of the Sum's elements, including the variable 'x' and the constant '+ 3'. It uses helper functions and adjusts baselines and heights to manage the display. This is directly related to the alignment problem described in the issue. Additionally, the stringPict and prettyForm classes in 'sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py' are also relevant as they provide the underlying infrastructure for managing the layout and alignment of pretty printed strings, which is essential for solving the alignment issue in the pretty print output of Sum expressions.",
