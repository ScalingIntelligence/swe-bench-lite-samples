The issue is not about adding new functionality but rather improving the existing pretty printing logic. The current file context includes the `PrettyPrinter` class and its method `_print_Sum` which is likely where the alignment adjustment should occur based on the pretty print output analysis. The new search results include the `stringPict` and `prettyForm` classes in the `stringpict.py` file. The `stringPict` class is responsible for managing the layout and alignment of the string representations of mathematical expressions, which makes it a relevant candidate for identifying the necessary adjustments to resolve the centering issue. Since the issue involves alignment around summation symbols, the methods within `_print_Sum` in `pretty.py` should be examined for any alignment adjustments needed for the summations themselves and the surrounding expressions like '+ 3'. Given the method `asum` within `_print_Sum`, it manipulates the alignment of the summation symbol and its limits, suggesting it might also be the place to adjust the alignment for extra terms like '+ 3'. This analysis suggests that both files, `pretty.py` and `stringpict.py`, contain relevant code for addressing the alignment issue.",
