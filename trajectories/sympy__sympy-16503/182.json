To address this, searching within the pretty printing module of the library will be necessary, focusing particularly on the 'Sum' class and its pretty printing methods.

It states that the 'x' and the '+ 3' in the output should be aligned but they are not. The issue suggests two possibilities: the 'x' should be lower, or the '+ 3' should be higher. After analyzing the search results, it is observed that the file 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' contains several methods related to pretty printing, which could potentially be involved in the issue. Specifically, the section 'PrettyPrinter._print_Sum' is focused on printing the Sum expressions and contains logic that might be responsible for the alignment. It includes functions like 'asum' that deal with the alignment and formatting of sum expressions. Additionally, the method '_print_Add' could also be related as it handles the addition of terms which could include the '+ 3'. Therefore, they are likely to be relevant code spans in addressing the reported issue about centering. However, more context or a specific part of the code dealing directly with alignment adjustments might be required. Nevertheless, these spans seem to be the best starting point for further investigation or modification to resolve the centering issue.",
