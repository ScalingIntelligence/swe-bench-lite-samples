The task is to identify the relevant code spans that handle the pretty printing of the 'Sum' class in order to understand how the alignment is currently managed and potentially where modifications would need to be made to correct the alignment issue.\n\nFrom the search results, the most relevant code spans are those inside the class PrettyPrinter, which is responsible for the pretty printing functionality in SymPy. The method `_print_Sum` is particularly relevant as it deals specifically with the pretty printing of summation expressions. This method includes logic to construct the pretty printed output for summations, including the alignment and formatting of the summation sign and its bounds. The adjustment of alignment and baseline in the method `_print_Sum` is done to center the summation expression, which indicates that modifications in this method could potentially address the centering issue.\n\nThus, the identified code spans focus on the `_print_Sum` method as it is directly involved in producing the problematic output for the 'Sum' pretty print.",
