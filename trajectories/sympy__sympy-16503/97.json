This method is responsible for rendering the summation symbol and its bounds correctly. The issue mentioned involves alignment between 'x' and '+ 3' in the pretty print output. By examining the `_print_Sum` method, we can identify how the bounds of summation are rendered and how the summand ('x' in this case) is positioned relative to the summation symbol and bounds. This method uses a technique called `asum` to lay out the summation symbol and align the bounds above and below it. The alignment issue could be stemming from how the summand ('x' in this case) and the additional term ('+ 3') are combined or printed. The `_print_Sum` method's final part where it combines the summand with the bounds and the summation symbol needs a detailed look to ensure proper alignment of the summand and the additive term ('+ 3'). Furthermore, understanding how `prettyForm` objects are managed and combined in this method is crucial for fixing the alignment issue. The provided snippets should suffice to identify and potentially correct the issue, given they include all necessary parts of the `_print_Sum` method that handle the rendering and alignment of the summation symbol, bounds, and summand.",
