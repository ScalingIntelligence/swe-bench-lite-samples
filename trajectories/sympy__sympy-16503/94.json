This could be an issue with the pretty printing functionality in SymPy. To address this, it's necessary to find the relevant methods responsible for pretty printing the Sum object and the alignment of additional components like '+ 3'. The file sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py contains the PrettyPrinter class with a _print_Sum method, suggesting it might handle the pretty printing of sums. Similarly, the file sympy/printing/latex.py has a LatexPrinter class with a _print_Sum method. These files and methods are good starting points for addressing the alignment issue. Additionally, files like sympy/printing/mathml.py and sympy/printing/repr.py also contain _print_Sum methods, indicating they might participate in the rendering of sum expressions. Further investigation into these files and methods is necessary to determine the exact cause of the alignment problem and to correct it.",
