The relevant code spans can be found in the `PrettyPrinter` class, specifically in the `_print_Sum` method and possibly the `_print_Add` method for handling addition formatting. The `_print_Sum` method includes logic for adjusting the alignment based on the 'asum' function, which handles the visual representation of the summation sign and its content. Given the description, the alignment issue likely arises in this method. Additionally, the `_print_Add` method, which deals with the pretty printing of Add objects, might also be relevant as it handles the alignment and formatting of added terms. It looks like the core functionality needed to address the issue is present in these methods, suggesting that the search task can be considered complete.",

The '_print_Sum' method includes logic for aligning the summation symbol with the limits and the sum expression, whereas the '_print_Add' method handles the alignment of summands in addition expressions.
