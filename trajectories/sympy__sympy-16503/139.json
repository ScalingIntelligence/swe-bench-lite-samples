The LatexPrinter, MathMLContentPrinter, and MathMLPresentationPrinter also have methods for printing Sum, which could be relevant if they interact with the pretty print functionality.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves bad centering for the 'Sum' pretty print. The alignment of 'x' and '+ 3' is problematic. To address this issue, I need to identify code related to the pretty printing of 'Sum' and 'Add' expressions, particularly focusing on alignment and formatting. I looked through multiple files but primarily focused on the files related to pretty printing and latex printing. I found that the 'PrettyPrinter' class has methods for 'Sum' and 'Add' printing that seem relevant to the alignment issue. Additionally, the 'LatexPrinter' class has methods for printing 'Sum' and 'Add' which might also be relevant. However, I did not find explicit handling of alignment for 'Sum' expressions in these classes. This suggests that the alignment issue might be in how the 'prettyForm' object handles the concatenation of these expressions or more deeply rooted in how the 'prettyForm' object or the rendering system handles the layout and alignment of the 'Sum' and 'Add' components. It's likely that the adjustment of the alignment needs to be addressed in the context of the overall layout and rendering process rather than just modifying one specific method. Therefore, in the identified code spans, there isn't an immediate solution that directly targets the reported issue, but these areas lay the groundwork for further investigation and modification to fix the centering issue.\n\nI identified the following code spans as relevant based on their roles in handling expressions like 'Sum' and 'Add', and they could serve as the foundation for addressing the alignment issue: sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py#PrettyPrinter._print_Sum, sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py#PrettyPrinter._print_Add, sympy/printing/latex.py#LatexPrinter._print_Sum, sympy/printing/latex.py#LatexPrinter._print_Add, sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py#prettyForm.__add__. These sections concentrate on rendering expressions in a visually structured manner, indicating they are regions where a solution could be developed.",
