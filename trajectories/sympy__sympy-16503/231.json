The relevant code spans are likely to be found within the _print_Sum method in the PrettyPrinter class of the pretty.py file, as this method is responsible for generating the pretty print representation of Sum expressions. The _print_Sum method in the sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file appears to handle the formatting and alignment of the summation symbol and its bounds with respect to the function being summed. Specifically, the method adjusts the alignment and padding of the summation symbols and its components such as the index variable, lower limit, upper limit, and the summand. The method's logic for adjusting the alignment of the summand with the summation symbol seems pertinent to the issue. Therefore, the identified spans are within the _print_Sum method of the PrettyPrinter class.
