This issue is related to the pretty printer functionality in SymPy, which is used for formatting expressions in a visually appealing way. The search results provided include relevant code from 'pretty.py', which deals with the pretty printing of mathematical expressions. The '_print_Sum' method in the PrettyPrinter class is particularly relevant as it handles the pretty printing of summations. This method includes logic for aligning the summation symbols with the expression below. The '_print_Add' method, which handles addition expressions, is also relevant as it may influence how the '+ 3' part of the expression is formatted. The identified code spans include the '_print_Sum' and '_print_Add' methods, which are directly involved in producing the output format mentioned in the issue. These methods will need to be reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure proper alignment of the 'x' and '+ 3' in the summation expression.",
