The method '_print_Sum' contains logic for adjusting the alignment of sum components, such as the variable 'x' and the expression '+ 3'. This makes the '_print_Sum' method in 'PrettyPrinter' the most relevant to the reported issue. The other search results pertain to LaTeX and MathML printing of sums, which are not directly related to the pretty printing issue that has been reported.
