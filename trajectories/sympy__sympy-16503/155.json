The _print_Sum method is particularly relevant as it contains logic for pretty printing the Sum expression, including the alignment and stacking of the summation symbol with its bounds and the expression itself. The _print_Add method is also relevant as it handles the pretty printing of addition, which in the given example includes the '+ 3'. Specifically, the _print_Sum method includes logic for adjusting the alignment of the summation symbol and its bounds with the expression being summed, which could be related to the centering issue reported. Additionally, the _print_Add method includes logic for handling negative numbers and rational numbers, which could also be relevant depending on how 'x' and '+ 3' are treated in the context of the summations bounds and the expression itself.",
