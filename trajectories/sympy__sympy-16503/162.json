The search results provide relevant code spans in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` under `PrettyPrinter._print_Sum` and `PrettyPrinter._print_Add` that handle the pretty printing of `Sum` and `Add` expressions respectively. These functions are crucial for the pretty printing alignment concerns raised in the issue. Notably, the `_print_Sum` method contains logic for adjusting the alignment of the summation symbol with its limits and function, suggesting it as the primary place to implement or fix the alignment issue. Additionally, `_print_Add` is relevant for how individual terms in `Add` expressions are handled and aligned, which could indirectly affect the alignment issues mentioned.

Specifically, adjust the baseline of the additional term to align with the summand within the summation symbol.\n\nThe instruction requires aligning the summand 'x' and the additional term '+ 3' within the summation symbol. This means modifications are needed in the _print_Sum method where the summation symbol is created and adjusted. Specifically, the adjustment factor within the asum function should be considered to ensure proper alignment of the additional term with the summand. The relevant lines are around the creation and stacking of the summation symbol and its placement relative to the summand.",
