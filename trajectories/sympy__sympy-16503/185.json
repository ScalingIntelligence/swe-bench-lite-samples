Additionally, methods like `_print_Add` and `_print_MatAdd` should also be considered as they handle the addition operations which might influence the alignment. The alignment issue might be influenced by how the adjustment and alignment functions are implemented within these methods. Furthermore, understanding the overall structure of how objects are printed using the PrettyPrinter class and the handling of different mathematical expressions could provide more context regarding the centering issue.
