To address this, we need to focus on the `_print_Sum` and related methods in the `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The `_print_Sum` method is responsible for how the Sum expression is rendered, including the alignment of elements. The `_print_Add` method is also relevant as it handles the addition operation, which could be part of the Sum expression. The `_print_Mul` method is less directly related to alignment issues but could be referenced if the Sum contains nested multiplications. In `sympy/concrete/summations.py`, the `Sum` class and its methods provide the mathematical operations involved in summation, but alignment issues are more related to the pretty printer in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. For this specific issue, we need to focus on code spans within `PrettyPrinter` that deal with rendering and alignment, specifically `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add`.",
