The other files (`sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/mathml.py`) contain similar methods for different printing formats but are not directly relevant to the issue at hand, which is specific to the pretty printer. By examining `_print_Sum`, we can identify the logic used to align the terms in the summation and determine if adjustments are needed to improve alignment. The current code includes functions that handle the vertical and horizontal adjustment of the summation sign, lower limits, and upper limits, providing concrete areas where modifications might be required.",
