Focus should initially be on methods related to pretty printing, particularly those handling Sum, Add, and Mul expressions. Previous examples indicate that the PrettyPrinter class within the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file seems to handle pretty print methods for various mathematical expressions, including Sum. Additionally, other formats such as LaTeX and MathML might also handle Sum, so these should be considered when investigating potential alignment issues. The target is to locate methods where alignment logic or the representation of these elements occurs.",

These spans have been identified as relevant because they directly deal with the rendering of mathematical expressions in a pretty format, which includes alignment issues like the one mentioned in the reported issue.\n\nAfter examining the relevant code spans in the sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file, it is clear that they handle the pretty printing of various mathematical expressions including Sum. The identified spans (_print_Sum, _print_Add, and _print_Mul) contain logic for how these expressions are rendered and aligned. Specifically, the _print_Sum method includes logic for formatting and aligning the limits of the sum, which is directly related to the centering issue mentioned in the reported issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, I recommend including these specific spans in the identified spans for further review and potential adjustments to address the centering issue.",
