The relevant code spans are found in the 'pretty.py' file where the '_print_Sum' method constructs the pretty representation of the Sum expression. This includes handling the alignment and formatting of the summation sign, limits, and the summand. The 'mathml.py' and 'latex.py' files are less relevant as they deal with MathML and LaTeX output, not the pretty print in question. The 'pretty.py' file contains the method '_print_Sum' which is directly related to the issue. This method includes logic to handle the alignment and formatting of the summation sign and its limits, which is crucial for resolving the reported issue.
