The search results from `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contain the `_print_Sum` method, which is directly responsible for the pretty printing of Sum expressions. This method includes logic for adjusting the alignment of the sum symbol and its bounds, which is likely where the misalignment issue arises. The `asum` function within `_print_Sum` handles the vertical alignment of the sum symbol and its bounds, which should include the 'x' and '+ 3'. Analyzing this section of the code is crucial to understand and potentially fix the alignment issue. Additionally, the `stringPict` and `prettyForm` classes in `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` are involved in handling the visual representation and alignment of string pictures, which could also be related to the issue.
