It manages the alignment and formatting of the summation sign and its bounds. The relevant piece of code handles the generation of the summation sign and its alignment with the upper and lower bounds, including the actual expression being summed. This directly relates to the issue as it controls how the 'x' and '+ 3' are aligned in the output. The method `asum` is particularly relevant as it handles the alignment of the summation symbols based on the ASCII mode.
