Specifically, the alignment of 'x' and '+ 3' is not as expected. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the pretty printing of Sum expressions in the sympy library.\n\nReviewing the search results, the file `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the `PrettyPrinter` class which is likely responsible for the pretty printing of expressions. There is a specific `_print_Sum` method within this class that handles the formatting of Sum expressions, including the alignment of the summation symbol with its bounds and the summand. This method appears to be the most relevant to the reported issue because it contains logic for adjusting the alignment and centering of the Sum expression.\n\nThe other files and their respective `_print_Sum` methods in the search results (`sympy/printing/mathml.py`, `sympy/printing/latex.py`, `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, `sympy/printing/str.py`, `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`) handle printing in different formats (MathML, LaTeX, Python code, string, and Mathematica code) and are not directly relevant to the pretty printing issue at hand. Therefore, the focus should be on the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file and its `_print_Sum` method.\n\nIt's important to note that the alignment issue might be addressed within the `_print_Sum` method of the `PrettyPrinter` class, specifically in the section that constructs the pretty print representation of the Sum with its bounds and summand. The issue might be related to how the sizes and baselines of the various components are calculated and aligned, which is controlled within this method.",
