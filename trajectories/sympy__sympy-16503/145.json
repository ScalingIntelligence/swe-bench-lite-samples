Specifically, the variable `x` and the addition `+ 3` are not aligned as expected. The relevant classes and functions to investigate are those involved in pretty printing, such as PrettyPrinter, and particularly the _print_Sum method which is responsible for rendering Sum expressions. Additional context suggests that latex and mathml printers may also have similar methods, indicating that alignment issues might be prevalent across different printing formats. The goal is to identify where the alignment settings are managed for these Sum expressions in the pretty printing process.",

The method contains logic to adjust and align various components of the Sum expression, including handling both ASCII and Unicode modes. The presence of this method within the file context suggests that relevant code for addressing alignment issues in the Sum pretty print is indeed provided. The method covers key aspects like adjusting baselines and stacking elements, which are crucial for aligning printed elements properly.
