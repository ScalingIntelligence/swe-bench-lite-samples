This issue likely involves the pretty printing logic specifically designed for Sum expressions as well as potentially the handling of additions (which is evident from the provided '+ 3'). Therefore, a close examination of the '_print_Sum' and '_print_Add' methods within the PrettyPrinter class should reveal crucial details about how the Sum and Add expressions are currently being handled in terms of pretty printing. Notably, the '_print_Sum' method contains the logic for pretty printing Sum expressions and aligns the '+' symbol properly but might not handle the terms' alignment correctly. On the other hand, the '_print_Add' method deals with the pretty printing of Add expressions and may contain logic relevant to handling the alignment of terms, which might be applicable or adaptable to the Sum expression in question. Thus, both methods are relevant for addressing the issue at hand. Given the details provided in the reported issue and the methods examined in the search results, I will extract the pertinent code spans from the '_print_Sum' and '_print_Add' methods.",
