The provided search results include several relevant sections, primarily in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods in the `PrettyPrinter` class are particularly pertinent. The `_print_Sum` method contains the logic for formatting the Sum expression, including the code responsible for handling the alignment of the summand and the addition terms. This method is directly involved in the formatting that leads to the reported issue. Therefore, this method should be analyzed in detail to understand how the alignment is being handled and whether adjustments are needed to align the 'x' and '+ 3' correctly. The `_print_Add` method is also relevant as it handles how additions are printed, which is part of the pretty print of Sum expressions.",
