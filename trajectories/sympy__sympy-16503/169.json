This suggests the issue is directly related to the pretty printing of the Sum class and how it handles additions. Since the problem is visual, it is most likely to be found in the PrettyPrinter class or potentially related visually handling classes. However, it could also involve the Sum class itself if there's an underlying logic issue that affects its representation.",
