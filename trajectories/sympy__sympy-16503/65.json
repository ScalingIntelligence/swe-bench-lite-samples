This method is responsible for rendering the Sum expression in a pretty format, and it includes the logic for aligning the components of the Sum expression, such as the variable 'x' and the addition component '+ 3'. In reviewing the `_print_Sum` method, I found that it handles the alignment of the upper and lower bounds of the Sum and the main expression. There is a potential issue within the `asum` function that determines the alignment of the components of the Sum, and thus may be the source of the centering problem reported. The `PrettyPrinter` class and its `_print_Sum` method are therefore the most relevant sections of the codebase to address this issue.",

There's a need to evaluate how the alignment is determined when combining the summation symbol with its bounds and the expression being summed. Given the complexity and potential variations in expressions (including those involving addition, as in the '+ 3' part), it may be necessary to extend or adjust the alignment logic within or related to the _print_Sum method. Additionally, there might be utility in reviewing methods associated with pretty printing additions (like _print_Add) to ensure cross-expression alignment consistency.

There's a need to evaluate how the alignment is determined when combining the summation symbol with its bounds and the expression being summed. Given the complexity and potential variations in expressions (including those involving addition, as in the '+ 3' part), it may be necessary to extend or adjust the alignment logic within or related to the _print_Sum method. Additionally, there might be utility in reviewing methods associated with pretty printing additions (like _print_Add) to ensure cross-expression alignment consistency.

The issue specifically points to the alignment of 'x' and '+ 3', which suggests that the problem lies within how these elements are stacked or positioned relative to each other during the pretty printing process.
