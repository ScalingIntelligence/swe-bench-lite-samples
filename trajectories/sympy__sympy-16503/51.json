To address this issue, it's necessary to focus on the code responsible for rendering the Sum object in the pretty print format, as the alignment issue seems to be related to the pretty print rendering process. We have identified relevant code spans from the 'PrettyPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', which is the class responsible for pretty printing SymPy expressions. This includes the '_print_Sum' method which handles the rendering of the Sum expression. The method contains logic for adjusting the alignment and positioning of elements within the sum, including the use of 'adjust' and 'asum' functions to format and align the sum boundaries and summand. Other files and spans related to LaTeX and MathML printing are less relevant to the centering issue at hand, as they deal with different representation formats or handle sums differently in their rendering process. Therefore, our focus should be primarily on the '_print_Sum' method in the PrettyPrinter class.",
