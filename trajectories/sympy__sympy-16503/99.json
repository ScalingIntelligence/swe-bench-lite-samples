The 'x' and the '+ 3' are not aligned as expected in the output. 2. Review Current Context: No relevant code has been identified yet. 3. Process New Search Results: - Reviewing the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file, the `_print_Sum` method seems highly relevant as it handles the pretty printing of Sum expressions. Within this method, the logic for adjusting the alignment of the 'x' and '+ 3' can be found, particularly around the `asum` function and how it handles the alignment of elements above and below a summation sign. - Also in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, the `_print_Add` method is relevant as it deals with the addition and alignment of terms in an Add expression, which could be related to the '+ 3' term in the Sum. - In `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py`, the `stringPict` class and its methods like `next` and `stack` are relevant for managing the layout and alignment of string representations in the pretty printer. The `prettyForm` class, which inherits from `stringPict`, also has methods for handling different types of math expressions including addition and multiplication, both of which could be relevant to the alignment issue reported. Conclusion: The identified code spans within `_print_Sum` and `_print_Add` methods in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and the `stringPict` and `prettyForm` classes in `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` are relevant to the reported issue concerning the improper alignment of 'x' and '+ 3' in Sum expressions. These sections of code should be reviewed to understand and fix the alignment issue.",
