This method handles the pretty printing of the 'Sum' expression, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Within this method, there are specific sections that handle the formatting and alignment of the summations, including adjustment of baselines and rows. This code is responsible for the layout of the summation expression in the printed output. However, the alignment issue mentioned in the reported issue seems to be related to the placement of the additional term '+ 3'. Given the provided code, it does not explicitly address the alignment of additional terms like '+ 3'. Therefore, while this code is crucial for understanding and potentially modifying how the summation itself is printed, additional considerations might be needed to address the exact alignment issue reported.",
