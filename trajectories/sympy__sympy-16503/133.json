The alignment issue pertains to the Sum class and how it is printed in the console. Given the current context, we should prioritize searching within the 'pretty' printing module and any related Sum handling methods. We should also look into the specific methods responsible for printing the Sum and Add (as 'Add' might be involved in the alignment of '+ 3'). The files identified in the search context suggest that the methods in 'pretty.py', 'latex.py', and 'mathml.py' are places to start. Notably, '_print_Sum' methods across these files may hold the key to addressing the alignment issue.",
