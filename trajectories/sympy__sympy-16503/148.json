To address this, we need to explore the `pretty.py` file where the PrettyPrinter class and its methods, such as `_print_Sum`, are defined, responsible for rendering SymPy expressions into a pretty-printable format. The `_print_Sum` method contains logic that adjusts the alignment of elements within the print representation of a summation, which directly relates to the reported issue of misalignment. Given this context, the method `_print_Sum` and any associated helper functions or parts of the class related to alignment should be carefully analyzed and possibly modified. Additionally, understanding how individual terms like 'x' and the summation itself are handled within the `Sum` class in `summations.py` might provide broader insights into potential areas for adjustment or new implementations to fix the alignment issue.",
