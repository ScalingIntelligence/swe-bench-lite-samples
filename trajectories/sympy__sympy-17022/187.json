The code printer currently prints 'I', which is being interpreted as the complex number 1j. The solution requires improvements in how identity matrices are printed and potentially raising an error for unsupported expressions that could be misinterpreted.\n\nFrom the search results, several key files and spans seem relevant to address this issue:\n1. `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` - Contains the `LambdaPrinter` class which likely influences how lambdify operates.\n2. `sympy/printing/julia.py` - Contains a `_print_Identity` method which could serve as a model for how identity matrices should be printed.\n3. `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` - The actual `lambdify` function is defined here, directly involved in the issue.\n4. `sympy/printing/pycode.py` - Contains `PythonCodePrinter` and `NumPyPrinter` classes, important for code printing in different contexts.\n5. Various other files contain methods for printing identity matrices or other matrix symbols in different contexts (e.g., LaTeX, MathML, Octave), which could be useful references.\n6. `sympy/printing/str.py` - Contains `StrPrinter`, which has a `_print_Identity` method currently returning 'I', this likely needs modification.\n\nOverall, these files and spans provide a good starting point to understand and address the issue. More specifically, the method `_print_Identity` across different printers needs to be tailored to correctly output the identity matrix, robust to different numerical and symbolic contexts, and not lead to misinterpretation like in the case of complex numbers.",

The current implementation of the code printer results in the identity matrix 'I' being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number '1j', leading to incorrect calculations. To resolve this, the code printer needs to correctly print identity matrices and handle unsupported expressions that could be misinterpreted. Relevant code spans include the definition of the LambdaPrinter class in 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py', which is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into lambda functions. Additionally, the specific method _print_Identity in 'sympy/printing/julia.py' is relevant as it shows how the Identity matrix is currently being printed, which can be used as a reference for implementing similar functionality in the required printer (e.g., NumPyPrinter). Furthermore, the lambdify function in 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' is critical as it is the main function used to convert SymPy expressions to executable lambda functions, and it needs to be adapted to correctly handle and print identity matrices.",
