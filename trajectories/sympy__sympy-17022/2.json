To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the `lambdify` function and the code printing mechanism. \n\nFrom the search results, we can see multiple relevant sections:\n\n1. **sympy/utilities/lambdify.py - span id='lambdify'**: This section contains the implementation of the `lambdify` function itself, which is central to the issue. It includes the logic for selecting modules, generating namespaces, and printing the function.\n\n2. **sympy/printing/**: Several files in this directory are relevant as they deal with the specific printers for different modules. For instance, `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, `sympy/printing/theanocode.py`, and others in this directory define how different elements like matrices are printed.\n\n3. **sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py - span id='lambdify'**: While this file does not directly relate to the printing of matrices, it provides an alternative implementation of `lambdify` which might influence how matrix expressions are processed.\n\nGiven the scope of the issue, the main focus should be on `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` and the specifics of the printers defined in `sympy/printing/`, particularly those related to numeric Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, or others that might handle matrix operations. The printers need to correctly interpret `Identity(n)` and print it in a way that it correctly represents a matrix operation rather than a complex number. Additionally, it will be essential to ensure that the implementation can signal errors for expressions that may be misinterpreted.",

Additionally, the code span in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` specifically addresses the Unicode representation of the identity matrix, which could be relevant given the context of the issue. The `lambdify` function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` is also relevant as it is the main function being complained about in the issue.
