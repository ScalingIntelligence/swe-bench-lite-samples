The search results provide context within the SymPy codebase, specifically in the 'sympy/printing/pycode.py' and 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' files. These files contain definitions for how SymPy code is printed into Python code, including classes like PythonCodePrinter and LambdaPrinter. The relevant code spans in the search results include the definition of PythonCodePrinter, where the identity matrix 'I' could potentially be handled or misinterpreted. Additionally, the LambdaPrinter class, which includes methods for printing logical expressions (_print_And, _print_Or, _print_Not, etc.), might also be involved, although directly related to boolean operations. Given the misinterpretation in the reported issue, the focus should be on how 'I' is being processed or printed, potentially in the '_print_Indexed' or '_print_NumberSymbol' methods within 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' or the broader PythonCodePrinter class in 'sympy/printing/pycode.py'.\n\nThe analysis indicates that the _print_Indexed method in PythonCodePrinter likely handles how indexed expressions are printed, which could include matrices. Additionally, the _print_NumberSymbol method in LambdaPrinter might also be relevant, as it handles the printing of various symbols that could include matrices like the identity matrix. The search task is not yet complete, as there is a need to verify further if there is specific handling or misinterpretation of the identity matrix 'I' in these or other related methods not covered in the search results.",

This highlights a need for the printer to correctly handle the printing of identity matrices and to potentially signal errors for unsupported expressions that could be misinterpreted.\n\nFrom the file context, we can see that the LambdaPrinter class in 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' has methods related to printing various expressions such as And, Or, Not, BooleanTrue, etc., but lacks specific handling for Identity matrices. Similarly, in 'sympy/printing/pycode.py', specific printers like PythonCodePrinter, NumPyPrinter, and SymPyPrinter do not have explicit methods for printing Identity.\n\nIn the new search results, 'sympy/printing/julia.py', 'sympy/printing/latex.py', 'sympy/printing/mathml.py', 'sympy/printing/octave.py', 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', and 'sympy/printing/str.py' all contain printer classes with methods specifically for printing Identity matrices in different formats. This suggests that the codebase has inconsistent handling of Identity matrices across different printers, but provides a guide on how to address this for Python code.\n\nGiven these insights, the task would involve implementing or enhancing the _print_Identity method in the PythonCodePrinter class located in 'sympy/printing/pycode.py' to correct handle the printing of Identity matrices. Additionally, it might be necessary to ensure that other printers like LambdaPrinter in 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' also handle this correctly to prevent future misinterpretations.",

The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n"
