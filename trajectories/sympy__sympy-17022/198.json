Specifically, the identity matrix is being printed as 'I', which is interpreted as the imaginary unit in Python. The task is to identify where and how the identity matrix is being printed in the codebase, and ensure it is not misinterpreted. Looking at the search results, we find multiple files where the identity matrix is handled specifically in printing functions. These are: sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, sympy/printing/julia.py, sympy/printing/latex.py, sympy/printing/mathml.py, sympy/printing/str.py, and sympy/printing/octave.py. Each of these files contains a method to print the identity matrix. Additionally, sympy/utilities/lambdify.py contains the main lambdify function which uses these printers. Based on the issue, the relevant spans of code are those where the identity matrix is printed, and those involved in the lambdify function to understand how the printing is integrated. Therefore, the focus will be on the _print_Identity methods and the lambdify function itself.",
