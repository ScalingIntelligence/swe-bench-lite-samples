The key concern is that the variable `I` in the code printer is being interpreted as a complex number, leading to incorrect results. To address this, the code printer should support printing identity matrices and signal errors for unsupported expressions that could be misinterpreted.\n\nNext, I examined the search results to identify relevant code spans. I focused on files and spans that dealt with lambdification, printing, and handling matrix expressions, specifically looking for code related to identity matrices or complex numbers. The `sympy/printing/pycode.py` file's `NumPyPrinter` class did not contain direct handling of identity matrices but is relevant to the printing and expression handling. Similarly, the `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` file's `NumExprPrinter` class is related to lambdification and printing.\n\nIn `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`, the `lambdify` function is central to the issue, handling the transformation of sympy expressions into lambda functions and managing modules and namespaces. This is directly relevant as it involves the creation and usage of lambdified functions. Finally, `sympy/printing/mathml.py` contains a method to print identity matrices but is specific to MathML presentation, which is less relevant to the reported Python code printing issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the spans identified are primarily from `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` and `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`, as they are most directly related to the lambdify functionality and could require modifications to handle the identity matrix correctly.",

The current printer code prints `I`, which is interpreted as a complex number (1j) due to Python's built-in constants. To solve this issue, the printer should handle the identity matrix appropriately, possibly by printing it as a distinct entity like 'np.eye(n)' for numpy. The search results include the `LambdaPrinter` and `NumExprPrinter` classes which handle the printing of various mathematical expressions. However, there is no specific handling for the identity matrix in these classes. The `_print_Function` method in `NumExprPrinter` manages the printing for various functions, including numerical ones, but the identity matrix is not explicitly handled. To address the issue, new methods for printing identity matrices in both `LambdaPrinter` and `NumExprPrinter` would need to be defined and integrated into the codebase. I have identified the relevant sections in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` that need either modification or extension to support identity matrix printing.",

Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n"
