Specifically, the identity matrix (I) is being interpreted as a complex number (1j) instead of an identity matrix. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect results when performing matrix operations.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to identify the part of the codebase responsible for handling the printing of identity matrices in the lambdify function. We should also look for any handling of the 'I' symbol to ensure it is not being misinterpreted.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant code spans. In 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', the '_print_Identity' method in the PrettyPrinter class handles the printing of the identity matrix, which is a good starting point. Similarly, in 'sympy/printing/latex.py', the LatexPrinter class has a '_print_Identity' method.\n\nIn 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py', the 'lambdify' function itself is found, which is directly related to the issue. The function's implementation and how it handles modules and namespaces are critical to understand if there's any misinterpretation of symbols.\n\nOther modules such as 'sympy/printing/pycode.py', 'sympy/printing/julia.py', and 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' also contain implementations related to printing and handling the imaginary unit or identity, which can be relevant in ensuring no misinterpretation occurs.\n\nThese findings provide a solid foundation to start addressing the issue by ensuring the identity matrix is correctly interpreted and printed, and not misinterpreted as the imaginary unit. Additional checks and changes might be needed in the 'lambdify' function and its associated printing routines.",
