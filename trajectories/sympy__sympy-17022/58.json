The lambdify function is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into lambda functions that can be evaluated numerically. The provided search results include two significant files: 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' and 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py'. The 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' file contains the LambdaPrinter class, which is likely involved in the code-printing process, potentially used by lambdify. The 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' file contains the actual lambdify function definition, which is central to the issue. Within this function, it handles the conversion of SymPy expressions into executable code, including handling various modules and printers. The debug output indicates that the lambda function generated by lambdify used the symbol 'I', which was misinterpreted as the complex number 1j due to the absence of proper support for printing identity matrices in the printer used. The key to resolving this issue is to ensure that the printer correctly handles and represents identity matrices, preventing misinterpretation. Given the context and the nature of the issue, the relevant code spans are in the 'lambdify' function and potentially in the printer classes like LambdaPrinter, which are crucial for generating the correct code representation of the SymPy expressions, including identity matrices.",

Specifically, the `PythonCodePrinter` or its subclasses like `NumPyPrinter` could be the source of this misinterpretation since they handle the conversion of SymPy expressions into Python code. To address this, I will focus on finding where the 'I' character is printed and ensure that in the context of matrices, 'I' is correctly interpreted as the identity matrix rather than the complex unit.
