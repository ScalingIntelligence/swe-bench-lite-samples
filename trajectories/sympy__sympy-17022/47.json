The expected behavior is to treat 'I' as an identity matrix, but it is being interpreted as the imaginary unit instead. This issue can be addressed by ensuring that the code printer handles the identity matrix correctly and avoids ambiguity. From the search results, the following code spans are relevant: \n1. The LambdaPrinter class in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` which is a subclass of PythonCodePrinter and is used for generating lambda expressions. \n2. The JuliaCodePrinter class and its _print_Identity method in `sympy/printing/julia.py` which provides a way to print identity matrices in Julia code. \n3. The lambdify function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` which is the main function used for lambdifying SymPy expressions. \n4. The PythonCodePrinter class in `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, which might be used in the LambdaPrinter or directly in the lambdify function. \n5. The LatexPrinter, MathMLPresentationPrinter, and OctaveCodePrinter classes with their respective _print_Identity methods in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, `sympy/printing/mathml.py`, and `sympy/printing/octave.py` which indicate how identity matrices are printed in different formats. \n6. The StrPrinter class and its _print_Identity method in `sympy/printing/str.py` which shows how identity matrices are represented as strings. \n7. The TheanoPrinter class in `sympy/printing/theanocode.py` which might be relevant for handling matrix operations using Theano. \n\nThese code spans cover various aspects of printing and lambdifying expressions, especially concerning matrices and identity matrices. They should provide a good starting point to fix the issue where the identity matrix is misinterpreted.",

The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n"
