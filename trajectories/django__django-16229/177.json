The provided search results include relevant sections from Django's admin and form handling modules, particularly focusing on ModelAdmin, SimpleArrayField, BaseModelForm, and BaseInlineFormSet. These sections contain methods involved in form handling, validation, and inline formsets that are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue. Specifically, the methods ModelAdmin.response_add, ModelAdmin.get_inline_formsets, SimpleArrayField.validate, BaseModelForm.clean, and BaseInlineFormSet.initial_form_count are relevant as they deal directly with form responses, formset handling, array field validation, and form cleaning. These methods provide a basis for further investigation into how the default values are handled and how validation might be bypassed under certain conditions.
