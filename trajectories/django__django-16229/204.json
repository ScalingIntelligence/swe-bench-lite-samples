When an inline contains an ArrayField and validation fails, resubmitting the form without changes bypasses validation. This issue seems to be related to how hidden inputs handle initial values, and a possible solution involves setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False`. To address this, I need to find the specific parts of the code where ArrayFields and form validation for inlines are handled in Django admin.",

The issue seems to be related to the hidden input containing the initial value and how it propagates across form submissions. We need to look for sections that deal with form initialization, validation, and the handling of defaults specifically for ArrayField in InlineModelAdmin. The relevant sections of code include those related to form initialization in BaseModelForm and model formsets in InlineModelAdmin, particularly the parts dealing with the formset and the default values of fields. Additionally, the validation process in clean methods and the handling of form errors in AdminErrorList are important to ensure that errors are not bypassed. Based on the search results, the identified spans include _create_formsets and get_formset_kwargs in ModelAdmin, get_formset in InlineModelAdmin, and parts dealing with form initialization and validation in BaseModelForm and BaseInlineFormSet.",

When an ArrayField has an error in an inline, validation bypasses on the second submit without changes. The fix involves ensuring that the default values of ArrayFields are correctly propagated when inlines are involved. Given the context, we are focusing on the `InlineModelAdmin` class and its `get_formset` method where the inline formsets are created. To address the issue, we need to ensure that the default values of the fields with callable defaults (like ArrayField with a `default=list`) are correctly initialized in the formset's initial data. This involves possibly adjusting how formsets are instantiated, ensuring that the `initial` parameter in the formset's __init__ is appropriately set especially if it has ArrayFields with callable defaults. Given the scenario described in the issue, it may be necessary to adjust how initial data is managed in the `InlineModelAdmin`'s `get_formset` method and how it relates to the model's defaults and the form's initial parameters. This balance is crucial to ensure that the inline formset reflects the correct defaults both upon initial display and when subsequent form submissions occur, keeping the form state consistent.",
