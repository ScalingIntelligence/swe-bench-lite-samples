The issue is likely related to how the form handles the initial values of the fields during form submissions and how it processes validation errors. Given the nature of the problem, I should focus on the Form handling and validation logic in the admin and form modules, particularly where ArrayField is used and where validation errors might be suppressed or mismanaged.",

The issue seems to revolve around the validation bypass and how default values are handled by the form upon submission.\n\n2. Current context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n3. In the new search results, there are several potential relevant code spans:\n   - In django/contrib/admin/options.py, the `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset` span is relevant because it deals with the creation of formsets for inlines, which is central to the issue. Specifically, it handles field exclusions and form validation, which could be where the issue with the ArrayField is occurring.\n   - In django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py, the `SimpleArrayField` and `SplitArrayField` spans are relevant as they specifically deal with the handling of ArrayFields, which is the field type mentioned in the issue. These spans include methods for cleaning, validating, and converting ArrayField data.\n   - In django/forms/models.py, the `ModelMultipleChoiceField.has_changed` method is likely not directly relevant to this specific issue but could be related to form change detection in broader contexts.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, the most relevant code spans appear to be those in django/contrib/admin/options.py related to `InlineModelAdmin` and in django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py related to `SimpleArrayField` and `SplitArrayField`. These spans directly address the handling and validation of ArrayField within admin inlines, which is the core of the reported issue.",

I identified the key components such as the `ModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, which handles the form submission and validation logic. Specifically, the `_changeform_view` method processes form submissions and includes the validation process. Additionally, the `InlineModelAdmin` class is relevant for handling inline formsets, which likely play a role in the issue since it involves a related model with an `ArrayField`. The `SimpleArrayField` class in `django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py` is directly related to `ArrayField` handling in forms, which is central to the reported issue. All these pieces of code contribute to the overall context of handling `ArrayField` interactions within admin forms.
