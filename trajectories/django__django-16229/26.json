This leads to validation bypassing when the form is submitted multiple times. The problem might be related to how hidden inputs are handled for initial values and how the form's clean method is defined. It's also mentioned that locally, setting `show_hidden_initial=False` on the field fixes the issue, which suggests focusing on the field handling and validation logic within the ModelForm and InlineModelAdmin implementations. This could include checking the `BaseModelForm`, `BaseInlineFormSet`, and possibly the `ArrayField` implementation in `django.contrib.postgres.fields.array`. Additionally, the admin-specific files like `options.py` and `helpers.py` should be reviewed for any related logic.",

The issue is exacerbated when the form is submitted a second time, bypassing validation and resulting in the loss of input data. The search results provided contain several key sections from `django/contrib/admin/options.py` and `django/contrib/postgres/fields/array.py`, which are highly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nIn `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, the `ModelAdmin` class and its methods `__init__`, `response_add`, and `_changeform_view` along with `InlineModelAdmin` and its method `get_formset` are particularly relevant. These methods handle form instantiation, validation, and response generation, which are central to the issue. The `_changeform_view` method, in particular, processes form submissions and would be where the validation bypass could be occurring.\n\nIn `django/contrib/postgres/fields/array.py`, the `ArrayField` class and its methods `run_validators` and `formfield` are relevant. These methods are responsible for handling the validation and form fields for ArrayFields, which are deeply integrated into the Django admin when defining models. The `run_validators` method specifically addresses the issue of validation within the ArrayField, and understanding its execution might explain why validation is bypassed.\n\nThe identified code spans are directly linked to the reported issue's context and functionalities. They illustrate the mechanisms involved in form handling, validation, and data persistence within Django's admin, making them relevant to investigate the issue further.",
