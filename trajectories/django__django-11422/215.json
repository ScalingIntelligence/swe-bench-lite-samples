Additionally, the runserver command in the core management commands should be checked for how it initializes and uses the reloader. The search should concentrate on these specific areas to identify if there are changes in how manage.py is being watched or if there are any conditions preventing it from being recognized.",

The key points to consider are the tracking of file changes and the reloader mechanism itself. The current context provided includes relevant code spans from django/utils/autoreload.py and django/core/management/commands/runserver.py. The new search results reaffirm the code related to iter_all_python_module_files and iter_modules_and_files functions in autoreload.py, which deal with iterating over module files and additional files, both of which are critical for detecting changes in files. Additionally, the Command class and its methods in runserver.py are important as they handle the server startup and the decision to use the reloader. These snippets provide a comprehensive view of the file tracking and reloading mechanisms in Django's development server, aligning well with the reported issue.",
