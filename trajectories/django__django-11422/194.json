The relevant code spans include the StatReloader class and its methods like `tick` and `snapshot_files`, which are responsible for checking file changes and triggering the auto-reloading mechanism. Additionally, I noticed the `watched_files` method in the BaseReloader class, which is inherited by StatReloader and could be pertinent if it includes manage.py in its watchlist.

The existing context shows relevant code spans from django/utils/autoreload.py, including the BaseReloader, StatReloader classes, and their methods. The new search results provide additional relevant code spans, specifically in the get_reloader and start_django functions. The get_reloader function determines which reloader to use, and the start_django function sets up the main Django thread with the chosen reloader.

Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.\n"
