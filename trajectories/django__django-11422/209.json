This behavior was different in previous versions (e.g., 2.1.8) where such changes triggered the auto-reloading mechanism. The main focus should be on the django.utils.autoreload module, particularly the StatReloader class, to understand how file changes are tracked and why manage.py might not be included in the tracking mechanism in Django 2.2.1. Additionally, examining the `runserver` command logic in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` might offer insights into how the reloader is integrated and if there are any specific configurations or checks that could be affecting manage.py.",

The `django.utils.autoreload` module is a likely candidate for investigation, as it contains classes and functions related to the autoreload functionality, including `StatReloader`. It's crucial to check how `manage.py` is being handled or excluded from the monitoring process in the `StatReloader`. The `runserver.py` file also comes into play, as it uses the autoreload utility to manage the server's reload functionality.

Also, the 'get_reloader' function is crucial because it determines which reloader (Watchman or Stat) is used based on availability.

From the provided context in django.utils.autoreload, it's clear that StatReloader does not explicitly add manage.py to its watchlist during initialization. The primary method for adding files to the watchlist appears to be through the `iter_all_python_module_files` function, which gathers files based on the modules in `sys.modules`. The `runserver` command logic indicates that it relies on the autoreload mechanism, specifically calling `autoreload.run_with_reloader` to manage the reload process. However, there is no specific mention or handling of manage.py beyond this. To pinpoint where and how manage.py is (or isn't) being tracked, we need a closer inspection of how the list of watched files is populated and whether manage.py is consistently being included in that list across different versions of Django. Additionally, exploring any version-specific changes in the autoreload logic could provide clues as to why manage.py is not being detected in Django 2.2.1.",

In the search results, the `StatReloader` class and its methods are again present, indicating that the relevant codebase for autoreloading is consistent. The `iter_all_python_module_files` and `iter_modules_and_files` functions, which are responsible for iterating over all python module files and monitoring them for changes, are also present in the search results. This suggests that the code responsible for detecting file changes is intact, but perhaps the logic for considering `manage.py` for monitoring is missing or not correctly implemented.
