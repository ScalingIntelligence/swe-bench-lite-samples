The search results provided are relevant because they contain key components related to the autoreload mechanism, specifically focusing on the `StatReloader` class within `django/utils/autoreload.py`. The `StatReloader` class and its methods, such as `tick` and `snapshot_files`, are critical for monitoring file changes and triggering the autoreload feature. Additionally, the `get_reloader` function also points to the use of `StatReloader` when Watchman is unavailable. In `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`, the `Command` class and its methods, particularly `handle` and `run`, are relevant as they deal with the server startup and the use of autoreload functionalities. These components together suggest that the issue might be related to how `StatReloader` initializes or tracks files, or an oversight in how `manage.py` is included in the watched files within the autoreload mechanism. Further inspection into the integration of `StatReloader` in the runserver command and its file watching logic is necessary to identify the cause of the issue.",

Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.\n"
