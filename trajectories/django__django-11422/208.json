The issue suggests that the autoreload functionality used to work in previous versions (like 2.1.8) but stopped working in 2.2.1. To address this, the task is to identify the relevant code spans related to the autoreload mechanism, particularly focusing on the StatReloader class and its methods since it's mentioned explicitly in the issue. This involves looking at the `django/utils/autoreload.py` file, where the StatReloader class and its methods (`tick`, `snapshot_files`, `check_availability`) are located. Additionally, examining the `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` file is crucial as it contains the Command class which is responsible for running the development server and may interact with the autoreload functionality. It's also important to note the `Command.handle` method, where the server's startup checks and configurations are managed, potentially influencing the autoreload behavior. Thus, the relevant code spans include those methods from StatReloader and the handle and inner_run methods from the Command class.",
