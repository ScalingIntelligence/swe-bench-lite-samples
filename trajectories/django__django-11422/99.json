The search results include code spans from `django/utils/autoreload.py`, particularly the `StatReloader` class which is responsible for tracking file changes. The `tick` and `snapshot_files` methods within `StatReloader` are of particular interest as they handle the actual monitoring of file changes and could be where the issue lies if the manage.py file is not being watched. Additionally, the `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` is relevant as it initiates the auto-reloading process. Specifically, the `run` method calls `autoreload.run_with_reloader`, which would need to correctly include manage.py in its watch list for changes to be detected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those that involve the file tracking mechanism in `StatReloader` and the initiation of the auto-reloader in the `runserver` command. These spans should be enough to diagnose and potentially fix the issue surrounding the auto-reloader's failure to detect changes in manage.py.",

The provided code spans provide insight into the implementation of the StatReloader and how it interacts with the autoreload mechanism. The issue could possibly be related to how the StatReloader tracks files or how the manage.py file is being processed within the autoreload system. The current code spans include methods like `StatReloader.tick` and `StatReloader.snapshot_files` which are crucial for understanding how file changes are detected and handled. Additionally, the `run` method in `runserver.py` shows how the autoreload is enabled or disabled, which is relevant context for the issue. Further investigation into how manage.py is being included or processed by the autoreload system might be necessary.",
