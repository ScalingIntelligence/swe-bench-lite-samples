The problem was observed in Django 2.2.1, where the autoreloading mechanism fails to trigger upon changes to manage.py, unlike in previous versions. To pinpoint the issue, we should focus on the StatReloader class and its related methods within the django.utils.autoreload module, as well as the runserver command in django.core.management.commands, which is likely where the autoreload mechanism is integrated with manage.py. Additionally, it would be helpful to check if the manage.py file handling logic has changed in the updated version.",

The search results provided contain several relevant code spans within the django/utils/autoreload.py file, which is responsible for managing the autoreloading mechanism. Key sections include the definitions of the StatReloader class and its methods, such as tick, snapshot_files, and check_availability, which are directly involved in the file change detection process. Additionally, the get_reloader function, which determines the appropriate reloader to use, is also pertinent. These sections of code suggest that the logic for checking file changes and managing the autoreload functionality is centralized in the StatReloader class. The manage.py file, which is mentioned as the file being edited in the issue, does not appear directly in these search results, indicating that the relevant code spans here focus on the internal mechanics of the autoreloader rather than the file specifically being used to trigger the changes. Given this, it's possible that the issue lies in how the StatReloader class is instantiated or used in relation to the manage.py file, possibly in a different part of the Django project or within the command handling of the runserver command. Further investigation into how the StatReloader is initialized and applied during the execution of manage.py runserver would be beneficial.",

The main focus should be on the StatReloader class and its methods that handle file tracking and reloading. From the file context, we have the StatReloader class which includes methods like `tick`, `snapshot_files`, and `check_availability`. These methods are crucial for the file change detection mechanism. In the search results, we find the runserver command which integrates with the autoreload utility. This integration is vital as it shows how the server is set up to use the autoreloader, including the inner_run method which invokes autoreload.raise_last_exception(). This method is directly related to the autoreload mechanism, especially in handling exceptions that might cause the server not to detect file changes. Therefore, the relevant code spans should include the parts of the StatReloader class that manage file tracking and the runserver command's handling of the autoreload mechanism.",

The `tick` method in `StatReloader` checks for changes in file modification times (mtime). Additionally, the `runserver` command's implementation in `django.core.management.commands.runserver` shows how the server starts with auto-reloading. However, the specific inclusion of `manage.py` in the watched files list is not explicitly shown in the provided context.
