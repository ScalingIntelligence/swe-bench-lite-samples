The search results provide several relevant sections of code in django/utils/autoreload.py. The StatReloader class is particularly relevant as it is likely involved in the process of tracking file changes. The tick method of the StatReloader class is central to this process as it checks for changes in file timestamps (mtime), but there's no explicit mention of managing changes in manage.py in this code. It's possible that the issue arises from the logic within the tick method or in the snapshot_files method, which generates a list of files to be checked for changes. Additionally, the get_reloader function, which determines the reloader to be used, may also be relevant if it fails to include manage.py in its watched files. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those related to the StatReloader, its tick and snapshot_files methods, and the get_reloader function.",

The `watched_files` method in BaseReloader is also relevant as it is used by StatReloader to determine which files to watch.

Further examination of how manage.py is being watched or if it's being included in the watchlist is necessary.
