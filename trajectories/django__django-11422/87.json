From the given search results, we can identify several key components: 1) The autoreload module in django/utils/autoreload.py, which contains various classes and functions related to reloading mechanisms, including StatReloader and get_reloader. 2) The runserver command in django/core/management/commands/runserver.py, which uses the autoreload module to start the development server. The issue suggests that modifications to manage.py are not being picked up by the autoreload mechanism in Django 2.2.1, unlike in previous versions. By carefully analyzing the provided code spans, the crucial sections involve the StatReloader class, the get_reloader function, and the Command class along with its methods in the runserver module. These components are directly involved in the autoreload functionality and the execution of the runserver command. Therefore, they are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

However, there is no explicit exclusion logic for `manage.py` in the provided code. The `runserver` command in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` integrates with the autoreload utility to start the server with reloading capabilities.
