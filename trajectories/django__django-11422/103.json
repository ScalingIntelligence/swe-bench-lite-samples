The key to resolving this issue lies in understanding how the auto-reloading mechanism works and identifying which parts of the code are responsible for tracking file changes. The search results have provided crucial insights into this process. Notably, the 'StatReloader' class in 'django/utils/autoreload.py' is responsible for tracking file changes using the 'tick' method, which checks for changes in files at regular intervals. Additionally, the management command for the development server ('runserver') in 'django/core/management/commands/runserver.py' is linked to the autoreload functionality, which starts the Django server with auto-reload capabilities. These pieces of code are directly relevant to the issue because they handle the file monitoring and server start-up processes. The fact that modifying 'manage.py' does not trigger a reload suggests a potential issue with how 'manage.py' is being watched or how changes are being detected. The provided code spans cover the core mechanisms involved in auto-reloading and provide a basis for further investigation or modification to address the issue reported.",

The relevant code spans to investigate are those related to the StatReloader's file change detection mechanism. From the provided code, the `iter_all_python_module_files` function returns all Python module files, and the `StatReloader` class has methods for tracking file changes using their modification times. The key methods to focus on are `snapshot_files` and `tick` in the StatReloader class, which are responsible for checking file changes and triggering the auto-reloading mechanism. Additionally, the `BaseReloader` class and its `watch_file` method could also be relevant as they deal with file watching. The current search results include these key areas, but it may be necessary to investigate further if manage.py is explicitly included or if additional configuration is needed for it to be watched. The provided search results cover the core functionality related to the issue, but further checks might be needed to ensure manage.py is included.",
