The issue mentions that under Django 2.2.1, the autoreloader does not trigger when 'manage.py' is edited, unlike in previous versions. This suggests a potential bug or change in behavior within the autoreload logic.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, several key areas of code are relevant to this issue:\n1. The `StatReloader` class in 'django/utils/autoreload.py', particularly the `tick` and `snapshot_files` methods, which are responsible for checking file changes and triggering reloads.\n2. The `run_with_reloader` function in the same file, which is central to the autoreloading process.\n3. The `Command` class in 'django/core/management/commands/runserver.py', specifically the `handle` and `run` methods, which invoke the autoreloader.\n\nThe search results confirm these areas of interest and provide additional context around how the autoreloader is integrated into the command for running the development server. The `Command.run` method directly calls `autoreload.run_with_reloader`, which is critical for understanding where the autoreloader might not be engaging as expected.\n\nGiven the issue description and the identified code spans, it appears that the relevant parts of the codebase have been located and are sufficient to investigate the problem further.",

Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.\n"
