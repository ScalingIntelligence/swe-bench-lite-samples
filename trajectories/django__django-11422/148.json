The search results provide relevant sections of code from `django/utils/autoreload.py` and `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`. Specifically, the `StatReloader` class and its methods `tick` and `snapshot_files` in `autoreload.py` are directly related to the autoreload functionality. Additionally, the `Command` class and its method `handle` in `runserver.py` are pertinent as they are responsible for starting the development server and could potentially interact with the autoreload mechanism. The focus is on how `StatReloader` tracks changes and whether `manage.py` is properly included in these checks. Currently, it appears that `manage.py` is not explicitly mentioned in these code spans, suggesting it might not be directly watched or included in the autoreload logic. Further investigation or inclusion of code handling `manage.py` might be necessary to fully address the issue. These spans provide a good starting point, but they do not fully cover the end-to-end flow of the autoreload logic, especially regarding the integration and handling of custom scripts like `manage.py`.",

Given the structured nature of Django's management command execution, it's possible that `manage.py` is inferred or added to the watch list through a broader scanning of Python modules or through a specific setup step before `StatReloader` starts its monitoring.

This leads us to primarily focus on the django/utils/autoreload.py file and its related functionalities. The issue suggests changes made in manage.py do not trigger the autoreload under a specific version, whereas they did under previous versions. A key area to examine would be how files are monitored and how changes are detected. The current file context and search results provided offer insights into the structure and functionality of the autoreloader. We should look for code spans that detail the file watching mechanism, particularly how manage.py might be excluded or missed in the watch list. Also, we should examine how the Django server, particularly the runserver command, integrates with the autoreloader. The integration points and the specific handling of manage.py or similar executable scripts could reveal why changes are not detected. Given the search results showing detailed implementations of file watching and server execution, we can pinpoint which sections are most relevant to the issue.",

Specifically, the autoreload mechanism is not triggered when manage.py is edited. 2. The file context provided includes django/utils/autoreload.py and django/core/management/commands/runserver.py. Both files are relevant as they involve the autoreload mechanism and the runserver command, which is used to run the development server. 3. The search results provided contain a subset of the code spans from the files already in context. They highlight specific methods and classes involved in the autoreload process, such as iter_all_python_module_files, BaseReloader, StatReloader, and the handle and inner_run methods of the Command class. 4. From the analysis, the key areas of interest are how files are watched for changes and how the autoreload mechanism is triggered. The StatReloader class and its methods snapshot_files and tick are critical as they handle the actual file monitoring and change detection. 5. The identified spans include the imports, the iter_all_python_module_files function, the BaseReloader and StatReloader classes, and the Command class's methods. These spans cover the essential parts of the autoreload mechanism. 6. The search task is complete as the relevant code spans that could help understand and potentially fix the issue with the Autoreloader not tracking changes in manage.py are identified. The spans cover the necessary parts of the codebase that interact with the autoreload feature.",
