The search results include the implementation of the StatReloader class in django/utils/autoreload.py, which is the primary focus considering the issue description. The key spans to analyze are those related to the StatReloader's methods, particularly 'tick' and 'snapshot_files', as these methods are responsible for the actual file monitoring. The 'tick' method iterates over the watched files and checks their modification times, and the 'snapshot_files' method is central to determining which files to watch. These spans appear relevant to the issue, as they directly handle the file watching and modification time checks that are at the core of the auto-reloading mechanism. Additionally, the 'watch_file' method in the BaseReloader class is relevant as it is used to add files to the watchlist, which might provide insight into why manage.py isn't being watched. Overall, these spans are likely to contain the necessary code to understand and resolve the reported issue.",

Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.\n"
