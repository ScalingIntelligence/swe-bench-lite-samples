In 'django/utils/autoreload.py', the spans related to the StatReloader class and its methods (tick and snapshot_files) are of particular interest, as they directly involve the autoreloading mechanism and file tracking. The manage.py file itself isn't explicitly part of the search results, which aligns with the issue description indicating that the autoreload mechanism doesn't respond to changes in manage.py. In 'django/core/management/commands/runserver.py', the spans encompassing the Command class and its methods (particularly the run and inner_run methods) relate to the server's startup and handling, which indirectly involve the autoreload mechanism. These sections are important as they show how the server is configured to use autoreload, supporting an understanding of why changes in manage.py might not be detected.
