I first reviewed the search results for 'django/utils/autoreload.py' and identified several code spans that are directly related to the autoreload mechanism, particularly those involving the 'StatReloader' class and its methods like 'tick()' and 'snapshot_files()'. These methods seem to handle file monitoring and could be where the issue lies since they deal with tracking changes in files. Additionally, I looked at 'django/core/management/commands/runserver.py', specifically the 'Command' class and its 'handle()' and 'inner_run()' methods, which are crucial for starting the development server and integrating the autoreload functionality. The 'handle()' method sets up the server and 'inner_run()' runs it, but they don't directly address the autoreload functionality, which is handled by the 'autoreload' module (as seen in 'Command.inner_run()'). Therefore, the 'StatReloader' class and its associated methods in 'django/utils/autoreload.py' are the most relevant to this issue as they directly monitor files for changes. The 'Command' class in 'runserver.py' is also relevant as it controls the server startup process.",
