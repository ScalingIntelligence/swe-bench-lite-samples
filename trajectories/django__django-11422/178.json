The search results provide extensive details on the autoreload mechanism within the `django/utils/autoreload.py` file, which is crucial for understanding how the autoreload functionality works. The `StatReloader` class and its methods (`tick`, `snapshot_files`, `notify_file_changed`) are particularly relevant as they handle the file change detection and notification process. Additionally, the `run_with_reloader` function in the same file is important as it sets up the autoreload process. In the `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` file, the `Command` class and its methods (`handle`, `run`, `inner_run`) are relevant as they initiate the server and handle its execution, including the decision to use the autoreloader or not. These elements collectively provide a comprehensive view of how the autoreload mechanism is integrated into the Django runserver command, which is critical for addressing the reported issue related to manage.py not triggering the auto-reloading mechanism.",
