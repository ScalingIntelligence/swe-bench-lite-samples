Additionally, reviewing the 'runserver' command logic in 'django.core.management.commands.runserver' could provide insight into how the autoreloader is integrated and used during server startup.",

The key elements to look for in the search results are the implementation of StatReloader, specifically how it checks for file changes and triggers the auto-reloading mechanism. In the provided search results, there are several relevant spans that directly relate to the StatReloader class and its methods: 'django/utils/autoreload.py' file contains the 'StatReloader' class definition and its methods 'tick', 'snapshot_files', and 'check_availability'. These methods are crucial for tracking file changes and determining if a reload should occur. Additionally, the 'get_reloader' function in the same file is responsible for selecting the appropriate reloader, which could be the StatReloader. Furthermore, the 'runserver.py' file contains the 'Command' class, which uses the autoreload module to run the server with or without reloading. The 'run' and 'inner_run' methods in this class are particularly relevant as they handle the server execution with the autoreloader, directly related to the reported issue. Analyzing these spans provides a comprehensive view of the autoreloading mechanism in Django, particularly how it should behave when changes are made to manage.py.",

Key elements in the issue include the `StatReloader` class, its `tick` and `snapshot_files` methods, and the `run_with_reloader` function which orchestrates the reloader process. From the provided file context and search results, we see relevant code spans in `django/utils/autoreload.py` pertaining to the `StatReloader` and its mechanisms for tracking file changes. The `run_with_reloader` function in the same file is also relevant as it is responsible for starting the server with the reloader. Additionally, the `Command` class and its methods in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` involve running the server with the reloader, making them relevant to the issue. The new search results confirm the presence of these key code spans in the respective files, particularly focusing on how files are watched and reloaded. Given the relevance and completeness of the identified code spans, the search task seems to be adequately addressed.",
