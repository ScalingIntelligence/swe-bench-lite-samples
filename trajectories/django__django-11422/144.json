The problem could be related to how the StatReloader class or its methods handle file monitoring, particularly for the manage.py script. Since the functionality involves the autoreload module directly, it's crucial to focus the search on modules related to autoreload, specifically the StatReloader class and its methods. Additionally, the management command runserver, which is used to start the development server and inherently uses the autoreload mechanism, should be inspected for any changes or inconsistencies that might affect the auto-reloading behavior.",

The reported issue suggests that under Django 2.2.1, changes to manage.py are not triggering the auto-reloading mechanism. This implies we need to examine the StatReloader class, particularly its methods for tracking file changes, and the integration point between the runserver command and the autoreload feature. \n\nIn the search results, we find several relevant sections:\n- The StatReloader class in django/utils/autoreload.py, which includes methods tick(), snapshot_files(), and check_availability(). These methods are crucial for the file-watching mechanism.\n- The Command class in django/core/management/commands/runserver.py, which is responsible for the runserver command and has methods handle() and inner_run(). The inner_run() method specifically interacts with the autoreload module.\n\nThese sections are directly related to the autoreload functionality and the server's response to file changes. By examining these parts, we can understand how changes to manage.py might be overlooked by the StatReloader and how the runserver command initializes and uses the autoreload feature.",

Notably, the `tick` method within StatReloader continuously checks the 'mtime' of files and compares it with previously recorded times to determine if a file has been changed. This directly aligns with the issue description of manage.py not being detected for changes. Additionally, the runserver command's handling of the autoreload mechanism via the `inner_run` method further supports the context's relevance to the issue.
