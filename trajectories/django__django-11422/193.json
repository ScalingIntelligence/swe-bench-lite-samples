This issue involves understanding how the auto-reloading mechanism works in Django and specifically why changes in `manage.py` are not being detected in Django 2.2.1 but were detected in previous versions. To address this, we need to look at the implementation of the auto-reloader and the StatReloader in Django's codebase. The search results include several key sections of code that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. `django/utils/autoreload.py`: This file contains the implementation of the auto-reloading mechanism, including the `StatReloader` class and its methods (`tick`, `snapshot_files`, etc.). These methods are crucial for detecting file changes and triggering reloads. The `get_reloader` function is also relevant as it determines which reloader to use.\n\n2. `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `runserver` command, which is responsible for starting the development server. The `Command` class and its methods, such as `handle` and `run`, are relevant as they interact with the auto-reloading mechanism.\n\nFrom the provided code, the key sections to focus on are the `StatReloader` class and its methods (`tick`, `snapshot_files`), the `get_reloader` function, and the `runserver` command's handling of the auto-reloader. These sections should provide enough context to understand why changes to `manage.py` are not being detected and to potentially propose a fix.\n\nThe relevant code spans are:\n- `StatReloader.tick`\n- `StatReloader.snapshot_files`\n- `get_reloader`\n- The `handle` and `run` methods of the `runserver` command.\n\nThese code spans should be sufficient to analyze and address the reported issue.",

The provided context and search results show significant parts of the StatReloader implementation, including its tick method and snapshot_files method, which are crucial for tracking file changes. Additionally, the runserver command implementation involves the use of autoreloader, specifically the run_with_reloader function.

The key components to focus on are the mechanisms used by the StatReloader to watch files and the handling of environment variables that trigger the autoreload process. From the provided context and new search results, the relevant code spans include the 'restart_with_reloader' function, which sets up the environment for the autoreloader, and the methods within the 'BaseReloader' and 'StatReloader' classes that manage file watching and monitoring. Specifically, the 'watch_file' method in 'BaseReloader' and the 'snapshot_files' method in 'StatReloader' are relevant as they deal directly with tracking file changes. Additionally, the 'run_with_reloader' function in 'runserver.py' initiates the process of autoreloading and is connected to the main server run logic.",

Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.\n"
