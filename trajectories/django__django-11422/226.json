The user has observed that under Django 2.2.1, changes to manage.py are not triggering auto-reloading, unlike previous versions. This suggests an issue with the file-watching mechanism within StatReloader. After examining the provided context, it's observed that StatReloader's tick method checks file modifications by comparing mtimes of files in its watched_files method. The current search results confirm that StatReloader inherits from BaseReloader, and it implements tick and snapshot_files methods critical for file monitoring. Additionally, the manage.py file itself is not directly mentioned in the StatReloader code which implies there might be a gap in how it tracks changes specifically to manage.py or it might not be correctly detecting the script as a change-watching target. It's crucial to ensure that StatReloader properly includes manage.py in its watch list and correctly identifies changes. The next steps would involve verifying configurations in runserver command, ensuring manage.py is automatically included in watch lists, or explicitly adding it to ensure autoreload detection.",
