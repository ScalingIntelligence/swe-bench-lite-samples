This suggests a regression or change in behavior in the StatReloader class or its interaction with the file system monitoring. To pinpoint the cause, it's necessary to investigate the StatReloader class and its methods, especially those involved in file monitoring and reloading. Additionally, the files related to management commands and the runserver command should be inspected to understand how the autoreload mechanism is initiated and utilized.",
