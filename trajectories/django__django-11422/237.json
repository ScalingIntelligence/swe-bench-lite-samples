This problem is specific to Django version 2.2.1 and does not occur in previous versions. The relevant files and classes to investigate include `autoreload.py` where the StatReloader class is defined and `runserver.py` where the management command for running the server is defined. To narrow down the search and find the exact code causing the issue, we should focus on the StatReloader class and its interactions with file change detection, particularly in `manage.py`. Additionally, checking the handling of the `manage.py` file in the runserver command could also provide insights.",

This is a regression compared to previous versions of Django that did track changes in manage.py.\n\nStep 2: Review the file context - The file context provided includes significant sections of the autoreload.py and runserver.py files. The relevant sections include the StatReloader class, its tick and snapshot_files methods, and the get_reloader function. Additionally, the runserver command's `handle` and `run` methods are relevant as they control the execution flow with the reloader.\n\nStep 3: Process new search results - The new search results re-include the code spans from the file context, confirming their relevance. The StatReloader class and its methods are central to the issue, as they are responsible for tracking file changes. The `get_reloader` function is also essential as it determines which reloader to use.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue, focusing on the functionality of the autoreloader mechanism in Django as it pertains to file change tracking and management.",

Additionally, the `runserver.py` file contains the Command class that initializes the server and decides whether to run with or without the auto-reloader. The `handle` method sets up the server, and the `run` method determines whether to use the auto-reloader. Given this, it appears that the context covers the main functionalities related to the autoreload mechanism and server initialization. However, it is unclear from the provided context whether `manage.py` is explicitly included in the file monitoring mechanism or if it is being excluded.

This suggests that `manage.py` might not be explicitly included in the file monitoring mechanism. It's crucial to identify if `manage.py` is treated differently or omitted in the auto-reloading setup. Given that the issue only occurs in Django 2.2.1 and not earlier versions, the change might be related to how module files are discovered or excluded during the setup phase of the `runserver` command.

From the initial file context, it's clear that the StatReloader class from django/utils/autoreload.py is responsible for tracking file changes and reloading when changes are detected. The issue seems to be that the manage.py file is not being included in the files watched by the StatReloader. To resolve this, we need to identify where and how files to be watched are decided, especially if there's a specific mechanism for including the main script (manage.py) in the watchlist. In the provided search results, we see methods and classes related to file watching and reloading, such as `BaseReloader.watch_file` and `StatReloader.snapshot_files`, which are critical for understanding how files are added to the watchlist. Notably, there's no explicit reference to manage.py in the provided snippets, suggesting that the manage.py file might not be automatically included in the files watched by the StatReloader. To address the issue, we should focus on enhancing the inclusion logic for the main script in the file watching mechanism, ensuring that manage.py is always watched.",

It's crucial to identify if `manage.py` is treated differently or omitted in the auto-reloading setup. Given that the issue only occurs in Django 2.2.1 and not earlier versions, the change might be related to how module files are discovered or excluded during the setup phase of the `runserver` command.
