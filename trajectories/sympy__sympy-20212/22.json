The documentation suggests that it should return `ComplexInfinity` (referred to as `zoo`), but the observed behavior returns `0`.\n2. So far, no relevant code has been identified, so the current file context is empty.\n3. Analyzing the provided search results:\n   - I notice a significant number of code spans that deal with Number, Float, Integer, and their operations, including power operations (`_eval_power` method). These are likely candidates, as power operations could influence the output observed in the issue.\n   - While the initial spans deal with imports and basic definitions, subsequent sections focus on specific methods such as `Float.__new__`, `Float.__mul__`, `Float.__mod__`, `Float.__rmod__`, `Integer.__divmod__`, and notably the `Zero._eval_power` and `NegativeInfinity._eval_power` methods. These specific methods handle the operations involving `0` and `-oo`, which are directly related to the issue.\n4. Deciding relevance:\n   - The `Zero._eval_power` method checks the behavior of `0` when raised to various powers, including negative ones. This could very well be the location where `0**-oo` is currently handled, which is contrary to the documented behavior.\n   - Similarly, `NegativeInfinity._eval_power` is relevant as it handles power operations involving `-oo`, a part of the operation `0**-oo`.\nBoth these spans are directly relevant to the issue as they directly deal with the behavior of these specific numbers when raised to powers.",
