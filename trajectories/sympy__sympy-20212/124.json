The documentation states that it should return `ComplexInfinity` (also known as `zoo`), but the current implementation returns `0`. To resolve this, we need to identify the relevant code responsible for handling this operation and modify it to return `zoo`. The relevant code spans should be in the `Pow` class, specifically in the `_eval_power` method, as it handles the exponentiation of expressions, including the case where the base is `0` and the exponent is `-oo`. Additionally, the `Zero` class and its `_eval_power` method should be reviewed, as this class represents the number `0` in SymPy and might contain logic for handling powers.\n\nThe search results include the `Pow` class and its `_eval_power` method, which is likely where the fix needs to be applied. The `Zero` class and its `_eval_power` method are also present in the search results, confirming that these are the correct files and methods to examine further.
