This discrepancy needs to be addressed by ensuring that `0**-oo` returns `zoo`. First, I looked into the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, particularly the `Zero` class, where its `_eval_power` method should be handling the case of `0**-oo`. This method currently has the behavior of returning `0` for any positive exponent and `S.ComplexInfinity` for any negative exponent. This method should be modified to return `zoo` for the case of `0**-oo` directly. Additionally, I also reviewed the `NegativeInfinity` class's `_eval_power` method to possibly address the inverse scenario of `-oo**0`, although this is not directly the issue at hand. Furthermore, considering the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py`, its `_eval_power` method also handles power operations but does not directly affect the `0**-oo` case. Therefore, the relevant code spans are in the `Zero` class's `_eval_power` method within `sympy/core/numbers.py`.",
