The search results include files from SymPy such as 'sympy/core/numbers.py' and 'sympy/core/power.py'. These files contain classes and methods pertaining to number operations and power evaluations. The issue specifically asks for the implementation of the Pow class method to return 'zoo' for the expression `0**-oo`. From the provided search results, 'sympy/core/numbers.py' contains the class Zero and its method _eval_power which seems relevant as it handles the power operation for zero. Additionally, 'sympy/core/power.py' contains the class Pow and its method _eval_power which is also likely relevant as it deals with power operations generally. These methods are crucial for determining the behavior of `0**-oo`.",

The relevant sections of the file context include the `_eval_power` method in the `Zero` and `NegativeInfinity` classes, as well as the `Pow` class. Specifically, the `Zero` class's `_eval_power` method handles the case of `0**expt` where `expt` is negative by returning `S.ComplexInfinity`. This matches the documented behavior. Additionally, the `NegativeInfinity` class's `_eval_power` method and the `Pow` class's `_eval_power` method handle power operations, but are not directly related to the `0**-oo` case.
