From the search results, I examined the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` and the `Zero` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. Within the `Zero` class, the method `_eval_power` is crucial as it handles the power operation for zero. Specifically, when the exponent is negative, it should return `ComplexInfinity` (i.e., `zoo`). The method `_eval_power` in the `Pow` class also plays a significant role in processing power operations. These code spans are essential for addressing the issue as they directly pertain to the expected behavior described in the documentation.",
