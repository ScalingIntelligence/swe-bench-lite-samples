To find the relevant code, I need to locate the part of the codebase where power calculations are handled, especially when dealing with the case of `0` raised to a negative infinity power.In the search results, I identified two main files that are likely relevant: `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`. The `Zero._eval_power` method in `numbers.py` seems particularly relevant as it directly handles power calculations for the `Zero` class. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_power` method in `power.py` handles power calculations in a more general context, so it's also likely relevant. These two methods should be examined closely to address the issue described.",
