Additionally, it's beneficial to review the `Pow._eval_power` method in the `power.py` file, as it contains general evaluation logic for power operations that might influence the outcome. These methods should be inspected to determine if they correctly implement the behavior described in the documentation, especially concerning the expected return value of `zoo` for the expression `0**-oo`.
