Reviewed the reported issue to understand that `0**-oo` should return `ComplexInfinity` according to the documentation, but currently returns `0`.\n2. Examined the provided search results to identify any code spans related to exponentiation or handling of special values like `0`, `oo`, or `ComplexInfinity`.\n3. Focused on the `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class of `sympy/core/power.py` as it handles the evaluation of power expressions.\n4. Analyzed the `_eval_power` method to see if it correctly handles the case where the base is `0` and the exponent is `-oo`. Found that the method does not explicitly handle this case.\n5. Also examined the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` for any relevant code spans that might handle or influence the behavior of `0**-oo`.\n6. Reviewed the `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py` to ensure there are no implications for handling `0` or `ComplexInfinity` within floating-point operations.\n7. Concluded that the provided search results do not directly address the issue, and more specific handling of `0**-oo` within the `_eval_power` method is needed.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are identified in the `Pow._eval_power` span.",

However, there doesn't seem to be an explicit check for `0**-oo` that would return `ComplexInfinity` (zoo) as per the documentation. The logic seems to be more focused on handling signs and complex plane aspects, which is useful, but it doesn't directly address the specific issue at hand regarding `0**-oo`.
