The relevant class for this operation is `Zero`, as it defines the behavior of `0` raised to a power. Specifically, the method `_eval_power` in the `Zero` class needs to be examined to understand how the exponentiation with negative infinity is handled. The search results reveal the `Zero` class and its `_eval_power` method, which contains logic that determines the result of `0` raised to negative infinity. This method checks if the exponent is negative and returns `S.ComplexInfinity` (aka `zoo`) in such cases. This suggests that the current implementation aligns with the expected behavior according to the documentation. Therefore, the search results provide the necessary context and code spans that address the reported issue.",

The provided file context includes the `_eval_power` method of the `Zero` class, which is crucial for handling the power operation involving zero. This method currently returns `0` for positive exponents and `ComplexInfinity` for negative exponents, which aligns with the expected behavior for `0**-oo`. However, the handling of `self` (which is `0`) to the power of `expt` (`-oo`) needs further verification.
