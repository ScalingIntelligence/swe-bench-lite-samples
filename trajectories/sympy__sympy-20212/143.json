This directly relates to the behavior of the `Pow` class and its methods `_eval_power` and `_eval_subs`. From the search results, the `Pow._eval_power` method appears to be the most relevant as it handles the power evaluation logic. The method contains logic that determines the outcome of power operations based on the base and exponent. Specifically, the key part of the code is where it checks the exponent and the base to decide the result, which should be modified to account for the case of `0**-oo` returning `zoo`. No specific handling for this case is evident in the provided spans, suggesting that this logic might need to be added or adjusted. Additionally, the `Zero._eval_power` method might also be relevant as it handles power operations specifically involving zero as the base, which could influence the behavior of `0**-oo`. This interplay between `Pow` and `Zero` classes is important for addressing the issue.

The `_eval_power` method in the `Zero` class is of particular interest, as it handles the evaluation of powers involving zero. Currently, it returns `S.ComplexInfinity` for negative exponents, which aligns with the expected behavior documented, but the observed output is `0`. This discrepancy suggests a deeper inspection of how `Zero` interacts with `Pow` during power evaluations. Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class should be reviewed to ensure it correctly delegates the power calculation for base `0`. Therefore, the search should target these specific methods in the respective classes to investigate the handling of `0**-oo`.",
