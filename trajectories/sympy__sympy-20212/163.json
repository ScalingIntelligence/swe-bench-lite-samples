The `Pow._eval_power` method is relevant as it handles the power evaluation for the `Pow` class, and the `Zero._eval_power` method is directly related to how zero behaves in power operations. Both methods should be examined to understand how `0**-oo` is currently handled and how it can be adjusted to produce `zoo`.",
