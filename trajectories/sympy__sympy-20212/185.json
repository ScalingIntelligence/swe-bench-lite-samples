            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the behavior of `0**-oo` in SymPy, where the documentation states that it should return `ComplexInfinity` (zoo). The current codebase, using SymPy 1.5.1, returns `0` for this operation. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code that handle the power operation and potentially modify the behavior for the specific case of `0**-oo`.\n\nThe provided file context includes several relevant files and spans of code, notably in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`.\n\nIn `sympy/core/numbers.py`:\n- The `Zero` class has a method `_eval_power` that handles the power operation for `0`. Currently, it returns `0` for positive exponents and `ComplexInfinity` for negative exponents. This might be the place to adjust the behavior.\n\nIn `sympy/core/power.py`:\n- The `Pow` class has a method `_eval_power` that evaluates the power operation. This method checks various conditions and computes the result based on the operands. We need to check if this method handles the case of `0**-oo` and ensure it returns `ComplexInfinity`.\n- The `Pow` class also has a `__new__` method that constructs a new `Pow` object and evaluates it if possible. This can also be a point of interest for understanding the behavior of `0**-oo`.\n\nThe new search results in `sympy/core/power.py` also contain these methods (`__new__` and `_eval_power`). Additional scrutiny of these methods will help in determining whether adjustments are needed to ensure that `0**-oo` returns `ComplexInfinity` as expected.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant spans are those handling the power operation in both `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`. More specifically, the `_eval_power` methods in both `Zero` and `Pow` classes are crucial for this task.\n\nGiven these findings, the task is not yet complete as we need to ensure that the relevant code sections align with the expected behavior of returning `ComplexInfinity` for `0**-oo`.",
