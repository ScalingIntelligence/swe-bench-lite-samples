The key elements to focus on are the handling of the power operation involving zero and negative infinity, and the expected result `zoo`. The analysis involves looking at how powers are evaluated in the codebase, particularly in the `Float` class and its methods like `_eval_power`. The current file context provides code spans from the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, specifically around the `Float` class and its methods, and the `Zero` class and its `_eval_power` method. The new search results add more context to these classes and methods, including additional methods of the `Float` class such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, `__mod__`, and `__rmod__`, as well as the `__new__` method of the `AlgebraicNumber` class (though this is less relevant to the current issue). The focus should remain on the `Float` and `Zero` classes and their handling of power operations, especially where zero is involved. It's likely that the fix for the reported issue would involve modifying the `_eval_power` method in the `Zero` class, or potentially another method in the `Float` class that handles power calculations when the base is zero.",
