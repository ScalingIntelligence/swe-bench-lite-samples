The `Zero._eval_power` method in `numbers.py` directly handles the evaluation of zero raised to a power, which is particularly relevant for the case `0**-oo`. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `power.py` provides a broader context for handling various power operations, which can be useful for understanding how power operations are generally managed in SymPy. By focusing on these specific spans, we can pinpoint the exact areas where the behavior described in the reported issue might be addressed or modified.",
