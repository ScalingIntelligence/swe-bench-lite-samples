The documentation suggests that it should return `ComplexInfinity` (zoo), but the current implementation returns `0`. The key task is to identify the relevant code that handles the power operation involving zero and negative infinity. The search results provide several potential relevant code spans, including `Zero._eval_power`, `NegativeInfinity._eval_power`, and `Pow._eval_power`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the power operation is implemented and how it might be adjusted to align with the documented expected behavior. The analysis of these code spans reveals that they handle power operations under specific conditions, which may need to be adjusted to correctly handle the case of `0**-oo` returning `ComplexInfinity`. Additionally, the `Pow` class and its `_eval_power` method are central to this operation, as they manage the logic for base and exponent interactions, potentially including the handling of zero and infinity.",

I will analyze the provided code spans to identify the relevant parts that handle the power operation for Zero and NegativeInfinity, as these are the key elements in the issue. I will focus on the methods involved in evaluating the power operation for these classes. The file context provided shows methods `Zero._eval_power` and `NegativeInfinity._eval_power`, which are relevant because they describe the behavior of raising Zero and NegativeInfinity to powers, respectively. In the search results, additional spans provide more context, such as the `ComplexInfinity` class and its `_eval_power` method. I will include these new spans in the analysis as they could be relevant for understanding the behavior and implementation of `zoo` (ComplexInfinity) in power evaluations. I will also look for any other occurrences of `_eval_power` methods to ensure completeness in my assessment.",

The relevant classes and methods include `Zero`, `NegativeInfinity`, and `Pow` with their respective `_eval_power` methods. Specifically, in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, methods for `Zero` and `NegativeInfinity` are seen handling powers. However, the `_eval_power` method of `Zero` does not explicitly handle `-oo` with returning `zoo`. This suggests a potential discrepancy or incomplete handling in the current code. In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow` class handles power evaluations, but no direct handling of `0**-oo` to `zoo` is evident in the provided context.
