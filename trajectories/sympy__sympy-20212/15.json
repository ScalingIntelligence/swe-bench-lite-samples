This discrepancy needs to be resolved by identifying the relevant code responsible for the power operation involving zero and negative infinity. The search results include various parts of SymPy's `numbers.py` file, such as the `Float` and `Zero` classes and their methods like `__new__`, `__mul__`, and `_eval_power`. The `Zero._eval_power` method is particularly relevant as it handles exponentiation when the base is zero, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, the `NegativeInfinity` class and its `_eval_power` method are also relevant because they handle the exponentiation when the exponent is negative infinity. Therefore, these sections of the code are likely to contain the logic that needs to be adjusted to produce the correct result (`zoo`) for `0**-oo`.",

Therefore, based on the provided file context, I can conclude that the relevant code for addressing the issue is present.
