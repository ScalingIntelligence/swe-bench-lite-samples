The code spans identified in the search results include relevant sections from `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`. Specifically, the `Zero._eval_power` method in `sympy/core/numbers.py` is critical as it directly handles the power operation involving zero. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py` is analyzed for its handling of power operations in general, including cases with infinite exponents. By examining these sections, it can be determined if the current logic aligns with the expected behavior as documented. Notably, the `Zero._eval_power` method does not currently return `S.ComplexInfinity` for negative exponents, suggesting a potential area for modification. The `Pow._eval_power` method does handle specific cases related to infinite exponents but does not explicitly address the case of `0**-oo`.

Similarly, the handling of `ComplexInfinity` within the `Pow` class should also be reviewed to ensure that it correctly returns `ComplexInfinity` for expressions like `0**-oo`. The provided file context includes the `Zero` class and the `Pow` class with their respective `_eval_power` methods. The code related to the `Zero` class appears to handle power evaluations, including cases with negative exponents.
