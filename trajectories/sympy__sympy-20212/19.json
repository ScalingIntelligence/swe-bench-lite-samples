This discrepancy needs to be addressed by identifying the relevant code responsible for this behavior. The search results were examined from the context of the reported issue. Key elements to look for include the handling of the power operation specifically where the base is `0` and the exponent is negative infinity (`-oo`). I started by looking at the `Float` class and its methods that deal with arithmetic operations, as well as the power evaluation methods in the `Pow` class. I found sections within the `Float` class that handle specific cases of multiplication, modulus, and power operations. Additionally, I found relevant code in the `NegativeInfinity` and `ComplexInfinity` classes, particularly their power evaluation methods (`_eval_power`). This method in the `Zero` class is especially crucial because it directly addresses the powering of zero with a negative exponent. The method checks if the exponent is negative and returns `S.ComplexInfinity`, which corresponds to `zoo` as described in the documentation. This specific code span was identified as highly relevant to the reported issue.",
