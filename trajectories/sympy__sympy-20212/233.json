This discrepancy suggests a need to review the power-related operations, particularly those involving zero, negative infinity, and complex infinity. Analyzing the provided search results, the relevant sections are found in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`. In `numbers.py`, the `Zero` class's `_eval_power` method is critical as it defines the behavior of zero raised to a power. Additionally, the `NegativeInfinity` class in `numbers.py` and the `ComplexInfinity` class in `numbers.py` also provide insights into the handling of such operations, especially with powers. In `power.py`, the `Pow` class's `_eval_power` method is examined for how it processes powers, particularly with bases that could be zero or involve complex infinity. These sections of the code are selected because they directly address the power operations and results involving zero, negative infinity, and complex infinity, which are central to the reported issue.",
