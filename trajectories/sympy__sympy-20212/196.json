The current behavior is that it produces `0`, which is incorrect. The relevant parts of the codebase to address this issue are in the `Zero` and `NegativeInfinity` classes within `sympy/core/numbers.py` and the `Pow` class within `sympy/core/power.py`. Specifically, the `_eval_power` method in the `Zero` class needs to be corrected to handle the case where the exponent is negative infinity (`-oo`). Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class should also be reviewed to ensure consistency in handling powers involving zero and negative infinity.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans include:\n- The `Zero._eval_power` method, which currently does not handle negative infinity correctly.\n- The `NegativeInfinity._eval_power` method, which could potentially be involved in the evaluation process.\n- The `Pow._eval_power` method, which handles the general case of raising an expression to a power and should be checked to ensure it properly delegates or handles the `0**-oo` case.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified code spans should be sufficient to address the issue. Further review and modification of these methods will be necessary to ensure the correct behavior is implemented.",
