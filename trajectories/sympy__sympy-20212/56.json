The second relevant span is in `sympy/core/power.py`, where the `Pow._eval_power` method handles the evaluation of power expressions, although it doesn't directly address the `0**-oo` case.

The code in the `_eval_power` method for Zero does indeed have a condition to handle a negative exponent, but it returns `S.ComplexInfinity`, which aligns with the expected output. Additionally, the Pow class is included in the file context, which is generally responsible for handling power operations, though it does not directly address the `0**-oo` case in a specific manner that deviates from or confirms the Zero class's handling.
