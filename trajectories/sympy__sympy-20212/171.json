This discrepancy occurs in the context of the Pow class. The relevant files to investigate in this case are `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`, where the Zero and Pow classes are respectively defined. The _eval_power method in the Zero class is crucial, as it directly deals with the power evaluation of zero. Additionally, the Pow class and its _eval_power method need to be examined since it is responsible for handling the power operations with a variety of bases and exponents, including zero, infinity, and negative infinity.",
