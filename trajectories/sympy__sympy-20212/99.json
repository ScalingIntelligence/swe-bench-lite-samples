The `Zero._eval_power` method correctly handles the case where the exponent is negative by returning `S.ComplexInfinity`. The `NegativeInfinity._eval_power` method also appropriately deals with negative powers. The `Pow._eval_power` method is relevant as it involves the general handling of power operations, although it does not directly address the specific case of `0**-oo`. The `ComplexInfinity` class's `_eval_power` method is relevant for understanding the behavior of `ComplexInfinity` as a returned value in power operations.\n\nRelevant code spans include:\n- `Zero._eval_power`\n- `NegativeInfinity._eval_power`\n- `ComplexInfinity._eval_power`\n- `Pow._eval_power`\n\nThese spans collectively provide insights into how power operations are handled within the context of `Zero`, `NegativeInfinity`, and `ComplexInfinity`, and align with the reported issue regarding the behavior of `0**-oo`.",
