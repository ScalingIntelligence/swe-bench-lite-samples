To address this, we need to identify the relevant code that handles the power operation involving zero and negative infinity. From the search results, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` is a likely candidate as it contains methods for handling power operations. Specifically, the `_eval_power` method within the `Pow` class looks relevant as it evaluates the power of a base when raised to an exponent. Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in the `Zero` class within `sympy/core/numbers.py` is also pertinent, given that it specifically handles powers involving zero. These methods will likely need adjustments to correctly implement the expected behavior for `0**-oo`. Overall, these identified code spans provide a strong starting point for addressing the issue.",
