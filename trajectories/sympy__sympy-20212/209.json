According to the documentation, this operation should return `ComplexInfinity` (also known as `zoo`). However, the current implementation returns `0`. This discrepancy suggests that the logic in the `_eval_power` method of the `Zero` class or the `Pow` class might need to be adjusted to align with the documented behavior. To identify the specific code responsible for this, I will focus the search on the `Pow` class within the `sympy/core/power.py` file and the `Zero` class within the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, specifically looking for the `_eval_power` method.",

The method `_eval_power` within the `Pow` class is responsible for evaluating powers, and it specifically handles the case where the exponent is negative. The relevant code spans for the `Pow` class include the import statements, the class definition itself, and the `_eval_power` method. We need to ensure that the evaluation of `0**-oo` correctly returns `zoo` instead of `0`. Since the current file context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet, our primary focus should be on the `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class, which contains the logic for evaluating powers. Additionally, we should consider the `Zero` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, specifically the `_eval_power` method for the `Zero` object, as `0**-oo` involves the `Zero` base and a negative infinity exponent.",
