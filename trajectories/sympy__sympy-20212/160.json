I will first look for the `Zero` class and its `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, as this method is likely to be responsible for handling the power operation involving zero. Next, I will inspect the `Pow` class and its `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py`, as the `Pow` class is central to handling power operations in SymPy. Since the issue involves `0**-oo`, I need to identify the code spans that handle the power operation with zero as the base and negative infinity as the exponent.",
