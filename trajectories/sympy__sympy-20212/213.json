In `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Zero` class and its `_eval_power` method are relevant, as they handle powers involving zero. The `Zero._eval_power` method specifically checks for negative exponents and should return `S.ComplexInfinity` in that case, but the current implementation returns `0` instead. In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow` class and its `_eval_power` method are also relevant, as they handle the general case of powers. The method checks for various conditions but does not explicitly handle the case of `0**-oo`.
