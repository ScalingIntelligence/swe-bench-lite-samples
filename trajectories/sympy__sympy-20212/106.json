The issue of `0**-oo` producing `0` rather than `zoo` as per the documentation is critical here. We should look for code spans that handle these specific cases within these methods. Additionally, the `Zero` class in sympy/core/numbers.py has a `_eval_power` method that might also be relevant due to its handling of powers involving zero. Both `Pow` and `Zero` classes are crucial for understanding how power expressions are evaluated in SymPy, particularly where zero is the base or exponent.",
