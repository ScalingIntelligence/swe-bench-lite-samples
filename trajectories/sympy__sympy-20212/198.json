This indicates that the code for handling `0**-expt` where `expt` is negative (including negative infinity) is accounted for. Given this, along with the references to power handling in the `Pow` class that are pertinent to the behavior of `0**x` where `x` is a complex or real number, it seems that all necessary code components for addressing the issue are included in the file context.
