This is a crucial part of the `django.dispatch` module that handles signals in Django. The search results include the `Signal` class and within it, the `send_robust` method as described in the issue. This method currently catches exceptions but does not log them, which aligns with the need identified in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those that pertain to the `send_robust` method, specifically the part where exceptions are caught but not logged. Additionally, reviewing the entire `send_robust` method for context ensures that understanding the current state and potential modifications is accurate. Given the context and the issue, focusing on the `send_robust` method within the `Signal` class is the most pertinent approach.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
