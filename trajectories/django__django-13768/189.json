Currently, there is no logging in the exception handling part of send_robust().

The absence of a logging mechanism within the except block is crucial as it directly addresses the problem stated in the issue. All other code spans ('imports', 'Signal', 'Signal.__init__', and 'receiver') do not directly contribute to the solution of this issue.

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
