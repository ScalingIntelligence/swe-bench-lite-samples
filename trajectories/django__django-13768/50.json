We should look for the exact location of this method in the `Signal` class to determine if any logging is currently implemented or if it's entirely missing. We'll also check the `Signal` class for any surrounding code that might handle logging more generally, or that could be modified to address the issue.

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
