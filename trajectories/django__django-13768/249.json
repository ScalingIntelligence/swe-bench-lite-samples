We should also ensure that any necessary imports for logging (like logging from django.utils.log) are present or added if missing.",

In the send_robust method, exceptions are caught and appended to the responses list, but there is no logging implemented here. This matches the issue report that suggests adding a logger.exception() call within the except block. The other sections of the code, including the receiver function, while part of the same module, are not directly relevant to the logging enhancement issue described.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
