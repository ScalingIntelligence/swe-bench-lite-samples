This is important for monitoring and handling errors in receivers effectively. The search results provided include two critical code spans that are relevant to the issue: the 'Signal.send_robust' code span, where the exceptions are currently caught without logging, and the 'imports' code span, which includes the logging module that could be utilized for error logging. The 'send_robust' method is where the proposed logging enhancement should be implemented. This location is crucial because it is where exceptions from receiver functions are collected without any logging. Adding logging here will ensure that any exceptions raised in receivers are logged, which aligns perfectly with the request in the reported issue. The other parts of the code provided are not directly relevant to the logging issue unless they interact with or call 'send_robust', which they do not in the provided code. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans are 'Signal.send_robust' and the necessary imports to enable logging.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
