Since the issue focuses on enhancing error handling by adding logging to this specific method, the primary objective is to locate the send_robust method within the Signal class. This method is part of the dispatcher in Django and should be targeted for modifications to include logger.exception() in its exception handling clause. The files provided suggest that the relevant code might be within django/dispatch/dispatcher.py, potentially where the Signal class and its send_robust method are defined. Given the specificity of the issue, focusing the search on this class method directly seems pertinent.",

This method is responsible for sending signals to connected receivers and handling any exceptions that occur during this process. The current implementation of `send_robust` captures exceptions but does not log them, which is the focus of the enhancement request. By examining the provided code, we can see the implementation of `send_robust` within the `Signal` class in the `dispatcher.py` file. The method catches exceptions in the `try-except` block but does not include any logging mechanism. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue is within the `send_robust` method, specifically the part where exceptions are caught and handled without logging. This identifies the exact location in the codebase where a logger.exception() call should be added to fulfill the request for logging exceptions.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
