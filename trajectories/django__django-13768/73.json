This method currently catches exceptions in receivers, as described in the issue, but does not log them. The task is to identify the relevant code span in send_robust() to add a logger.exception() call within its exception handling block. Additionally, examining the logging setup in the logging utility file could help understand how logging is configured and integrated into Django. The relevant part of the logging file (django/utils/log.py) provides insights and functions needed, such as configuring and handling logging through the AdminEmailHandler class, which might be used or referred to by logger.exception(). These findings are directly tied to enhancing error logging within the Signal class, particularly targeting the send_robust() method's exception handling for better visibility in error tools like Sentry.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
