The current implementation catches exceptions using a try-except block, but it does not log these exceptions. This is the exact point where we need to integrate the logging mechanism as per the reported issue. \n\nThe other code spans, such as 'Signal.__init__' and 'Signal._clear_dead_receivers', while important for the functioning of the Signal class, are not directly relevant to the logging of exceptions during the signal sending process. Similarly, the 'receiver' function is related to connecting receivers to signals but does not pertain to exception logging during signal sending.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
