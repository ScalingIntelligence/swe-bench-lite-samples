This method is responsible for sending signals to registered receivers and handling exceptions robustly without logging them currently. I reviewed the provided code and found the `Signal` class and its `send_robust` method within 'django/dispatch/dispatcher.py'. The method contains a try-except block that catches exceptions raised by receivers but lacks logging. Given the requirement to log exceptions for better visibility into errors, the relevant code span is the `send_robust` method itself. This method should be modified to include a logging statement within its except block to log any exceptions that are caught. Other methods such as `connect`, `disconnect`, and `has_listeners` are related to signal management but are not directly relevant to the logging enhancement requested in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()\nDescription\n\t\nAs pointed out by \u200bHaki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
