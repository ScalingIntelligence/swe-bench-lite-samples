This enhancement will help in better visibility of such exceptions in error handling tools like Sentry. The relevant code spans from the search results are identified based on their direct involvement in exception handling and signal transmission. The span `Signal.send_robust` is directly related to the exception handling process in the context of signal transmission, making it highly relevant. The inclusion of a logger.exception call within the except block of this span would fulfill the requirement specified in the issue. Additionally, understanding the logging utilities provided by Django, such as the `AdminEmailHandler`, which already has methods to handle and report exceptions via email, provides context on how new logging can be configured similarly. This understanding is crucial for making an informed decision about where and how to implement the new logging functionality. Thus, while there isn't a direct need to include `AdminEmailHandler` due to its role in emailing exceptions rather than logging them, it's informative for understanding Django's exception handling and logging mechanisms, which could influence future enhancements or interactions with the current request.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
