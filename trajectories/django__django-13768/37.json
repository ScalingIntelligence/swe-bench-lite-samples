The `Signal` class is responsible for handling signals in Django, and `send_robust()` is a method that allows sending signals to receivers while catching exceptions. The current implementation of `send_robust()` catches exceptions but does not log them, which is what the reported issue is suggesting to change. \n\nIn the provided search results, I identified the relevant code spans in 'django/dispatch/dispatcher.py'. The spans labeled 'Signal' and 'Signal.send_robust' are directly related to the `Signal` class and the `send_robust()` method. The code inside 'Signal.send_robust' shows the method catching exceptions in the receiver but not logging them, which aligns with the problem described in the reported issue. No other spans directly address the issue of logging exceptions in `send_robust()`. Therefore, the relevant spans I identified are those containing the `Signal` class definition and the `send_robust()` method implementation. This will allow for the modification of `send_robust()` to log exceptions as required by the reported issue.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
