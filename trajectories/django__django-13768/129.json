It is suggested to add logging for exceptions caught in this method to improve error handling and visibility, similar to Django's approach in other contexts such as missing template variables. Given this, the analysis of the provided search results reveals that the `Signal` class and its `send_robust` method are indeed present. This method is responsible for robustly sending signals to receivers and catching any exceptions that occur in these receivers without breaking the entire process. The current implementation of `send_robust` has an except clause that catches exceptions, but it lacks any logging mechanism. This aligns perfectly with the issue description, which recommends adding a `logger.exception()` call within the except clause to log any exceptions that are caught.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
