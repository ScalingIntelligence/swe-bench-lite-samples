The relevant code span is the `send_robust` method within the `Signal` class. This method is responsible for sending signals to all connected receivers and handling exceptions that may occur during this process. The current implementation catches exceptions but does not log them, which aligns with the issue description. Adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of `send_robust` would meet the requirement for logging exceptions to notify users about them. This approach would integrate well with error handling tools like Sentry, ensuring that users can act on the logged exceptions.

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
