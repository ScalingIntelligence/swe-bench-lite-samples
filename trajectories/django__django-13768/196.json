This method is responsible for invoking signal receivers and robustly handling any exceptions that may occur during this process. The analysis of the code spans provided reveals that the `send_robust` method indeed captures exceptions but does not log them. The solution suggested is to add a logging call (`logger.exception()`) within the exception handling block of this method. This would ensure that any exceptions occurring during signal dispatch are logged, making it easier for developers to track and address these issues. Given this context, the relevant code span to address the issue is the span labeled 'Signal.send_robust'. While reviewing the entire section of 'Signal.send_robust', it appears to be isolated and self-contained without needing additional contextual code from other spans for this specific issue.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
