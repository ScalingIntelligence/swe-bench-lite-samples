Specifically, it suggests adding a `logger.exception()` call within the `except` clause of `send_robust` to ensure that exceptions raised in receivers are logged. This would make the logging behavior consistent with other parts of Django and enable better error tracking with tools like Sentry.\n\nExamining the provided code and search results, the relevant code span is clearly the `Signal.send_robust` method. This method currently captures exceptions in the receivers but does not log them. The provided context and search results both point to the same method, confirming the need to modify this part of the code. No other parts of the search results appear directly relevant to the issue of logging exceptions within `send_robust`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the task of identifying relevant code spans is straightforward: the focus should be solely on the `Signal.send_robust` method to add the necessary logging. The inclusion of the `_clear_dead_receivers` method in the search results is incidental and does not relate to the issue at hand.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
