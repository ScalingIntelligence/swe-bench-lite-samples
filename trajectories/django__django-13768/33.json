The search results provide a detailed look into the implementation of the Signal class and its send_robust method. This method currently catches exceptions but lacks specific logging for these exceptions. For addressing the issue, the relevant code span would be the try-except block within Signal.send_robust. Adding a logger.exception() call here would fulfill the requirement to log exceptions more effectively. This aligns with Django's handling of exceptions in other similar contexts, providing a more consistent debugging experience across the framework. Additionally, the context around the Signal class and its methods helps in understanding the broader functionality related to signals and receivers in Django. The identified span within Signal.send_robust is the most relevant code span to modify for the desired logging enhancement.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
