Given the context, the focus should be on the `dispatcher.py` file which contains the definition of the `Signal` class and the `send_robust` method. Additionally, considering Django's practice of logging exceptions in other similar situations, it's worth examining how exceptions are logged in other parts of the codebase for inspiration. Specifically, looking at how `AdminEmailHandler` in `django/utils/log.py` handles logging might provide insights into how to add logging functionality to `send_robust`.",

This enhancement will allow users to capture and monitor exceptions in tools like Sentry. The current implementation of `send_robust` only captures exceptions and appends them to the responses list but does not log them. The provided search results include a file (`django/utils/log.py`) that contains logging configurations, specifically the `AdminEmailHandler` class and related methods. This class is designed to handle and format exception logging and email reporting, which can be leveraged to achieve the desired logging functionality within `send_robust`. It's essential to integrate a logger within the `send_robust` method to log exceptions using a method similar to `AdminEmailHandler.emit`. This approach ensures that exceptions from `send_robust` are logged and possibly emailed to admins as per the logging configuration. Therefore, the identified span from `django/utils/log.py` is relevant for enhancing the logging capability in `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
