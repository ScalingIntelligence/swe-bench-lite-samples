The reported issue specifically points out the need to add logging for exceptions that occur within the method 'send_robust'. This method currently catches exceptions raised in the receivers but does not log them. By examining the code, I identified the exact span within 'Signal.send_robust' where an exception is caught, which is the appropriate place to add logging using 'logger.exception()'. This approach ensures that any exceptions encountered in the receivers during signal sending are logged, allowing for better debugging and integration with error handling tools like Sentry. Based on the issue and the current context, the part of the code to be modified is clearly within the 'send_robust' method.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
