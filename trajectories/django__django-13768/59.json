This involves identifying and modifying the `send_robust` method within the `Signal` class to include a logging mechanism that captures and logs these exceptions. This would be analogous to how Django logs other similar exceptions, such as missing template variables. The files provided hint at where the `Signal` class might be located and suggest further places where logging utilities might be implemented in Django.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
