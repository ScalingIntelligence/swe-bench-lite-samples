The relevant code spans are within the `Signal` class, specifically in the `send_robust` method where exceptions are caught and handled. This is where the logging of exceptions should be added. The provided search results include the entire `Signal` class and the `send_robust` method, which is where the change needs to be applied. The `send_robust` method contains the logic where receivers are called and exceptions are caught. By adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause, the functionality would align with Django's practice of logging exceptions in similar situations and would allow users to see these exceptions in their error handling tools.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
