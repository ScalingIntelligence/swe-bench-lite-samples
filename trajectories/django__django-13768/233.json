Currently, `send_robust()` includes an except clause to catch exceptions raised in receivers, but does not log these exceptions. This is in contrast to other Django behaviors where exceptions are logged, as mentioned in the issue description. By reviewing the <search_results>, it becomes apparent that the relevant code span for `Signal.send_robust()` is located within the 'django/dispatch/dispatcher.py' file. This span encompasses the method `send_robust()`, which is the exact location where the logging functionality should be added to address the reported issue.

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
