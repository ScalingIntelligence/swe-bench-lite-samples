The method currently catches exceptions and appends them to the responses list but does not log them. To address the issue, a logger could be added to log the exceptions before they are appended to the responses list. This will ensure that any exceptions raised in the receivers are logged and can be picked up by tools like Sentry for further analysis.

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
