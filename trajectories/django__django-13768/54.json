This function should include a `logger.exception()` call to capture exceptions raised in receivers. This is important as it will provide insight into exceptions encountered during signal transmission, similar to how Django logs other exceptions. Given this context, I reviewed the `send_robust` method in `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py` and determined that it currently lacks exception logging. I also examined `django/utils/log.py` to understand how Django handles logging in other contexts. The `AdminEmailHandler` class shows how Django can log exceptions and email them to admins, which provides a model for how exceptions might be logged within the `send_robust` method. Based on this analysis, the `send_robust` method should be updated to include exception logging, and the existing `Signal.send_robust` code span is relevant for this update. Other sections of code, such as those related to logging configuration and handling in `django/utils/log.py`, are background information for context but not directly relevant for implementing the proposed change in `send_robust`.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
