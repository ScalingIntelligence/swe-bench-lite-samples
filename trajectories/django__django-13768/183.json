This method currently includes a try-except block where exceptions caught from receivers are handled without any logging.

Additionally, the `Signal` class initialization information in span 'Signal.__init__' could also be relevant context for understanding the broader setup and configuration in which `send_robust` operates.

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
