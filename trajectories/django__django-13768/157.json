To address this, we first need to identify the current implementation of this method within the search results. It's found in the code span with the ID 'Signal.send_robust' in the file 'django/dispatch/dispatcher.py'. This method currently catches exceptions but does not log them. The second part of the search results in 'django/utils/log.py' shows various log configurations and handlers that could be used, particularly a custom handler for admin emails and a utility function for logging responses. These configurations generally guide on how logging can be done in Django, but they don't directly address the missing logging in 'send_robust'. It's deduced that while these settings and handlers likely support what needs to be done, the actual insertion of the 'logger.exception()' should occur in the 'Signal.send_robust' function. This insertion would typically log exceptions immediately after they are caught, providing the necessary visibility as requested. Thus, the identified code span focusing on 'Signal.send_robust' is relevant and provides the context needed to insert proper logging for exceptions in receiver functions.",

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
