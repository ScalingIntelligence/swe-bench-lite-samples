To address this, we need to examine the relevant parts of the Q class and its interaction with operators. The search results provide a detailed look into the Q class methods such as '__init__', '__or__', '__and__', '__invert__', and 'deconstruct'. These methods are crucial for understanding how the Q objects are combined and how they interact with operators. Additionally, the Query class methods 'combine' and 'build_filter' are examined as they are involved in the process of combining queries and building filters, respectively. These methods are directly related to the operator behavior and could potentially be involved in the TypeError if the 'dict_keys' object is not handled properly. The 'JoinPromoter' class, though related to query joining, does not directly address the pickleability issue but is relevant to understanding the query combination context. The analysis of these code spans provides a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the codebase that could be contributing to or could be modified to address the reported issue.",
