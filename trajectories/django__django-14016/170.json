The search results provide crucial insights into the implementation of the Q class and its methods, particularly those handling combination operations (e.g., __or__, __and__, _combine). These methods are directly relevant to the issue as they define the behavior of the | operator with Q objects. Additionally, the QuerySet class and its methods (__and__, __or__) are relevant as they interact with Q objects, which could also be implicated in the issue. The Combinable class, while not directly causing the issue, illustrates the potential constraints and checks in operations involving Q objects. Therefore, focusing on the Q class and its combination methods, along with the QuerySet class methods, should provide a solid basis for addressing the issue.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The Q class definition and its methods (_combine, __or__, __and__, __invert__, resolve_expression, deconstruct) are directly linked to the operations causing the error.\n2. The QuerySet class methods (__and__, __or__) are also relevant as they deal with combining Q objects and could be where the error manifests in a broader context.\n3. The Combinable class, though not directly the cause of the issue, provides context on how operations are handled with Q objects.\n\nDecision: Based on the reported issue and the search results, the relevant code spans are those within the Q class and the QuerySet class that deal with combining Q objects, specifically focusing on the methods handling the | and & operators. These are critical for understanding and resolving the issue.",

This includes `Q.__init__`, `Q._combine`, `Q.__or__`, and `Q.__and__`, which are directly related to the functionality of combining Q objects using logical operators. Additionally, the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` provide context on how queries are combined and managed, which may be relevant to understanding the issue. The presence of `JoinPromoter` class in the search results also indicates systems involved in managing join operations, which could be indirectly related to the issue. Given these findings, it seems the search results capture a substantial part of the codebase relevant to the reported issue. The identified code spans in the `Q` class and related classes provide a good starting point for understanding and potentially fixing the 'TypeError'. Further investigation may involve checking how objects are pickled and managed in these contexts, especially around the combination of Q objects.",

This absence of specific handling for objects like 'dict_keys' could explain the 'TypeError: cannot pickle' error when applying the | operator. The method should ideally include checks or error handling for non-pickleable objects. Given that the Q class is fundamental to building complex queries in Django, the lack of such error handling could indeed lead to crashes. Further, in query.py and query.py, the handling of Q objects within QuerySet and Query classes did not reveal specific mechanisms to manage non-pickleable elements during the combination processes. Thus, while the file context offers insights into how Q objects are managed, it doesn't entirely cover or resolve the pickle error issue described, suggesting a need for deeper inspection into handling non-pickleable objects within the query utilities and frameworks.",
