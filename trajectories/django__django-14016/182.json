The search results include several key functions and classes from Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that are likely relevant to this issue. The `Query` class and its methods such as `combine`, `build_filter`, and `_add_q` deal with combining queries and building filters, which are directly related to the operations involving Q objects. These are the main places where the | operator for Q objects would be implemented and where issues related to pickling could arise. The `JoinPromoter` class, while indirectly related, also plays a role in query combination. Given the specific error related to pickling, the focus should be on ensuring that objects within the `Query` class and its methods can handle pickling correctly. This means identifying and modifying any parts of the code that involve passing non-pickleable objects into the query construction or combination processes.",

Specifically, using a non-pickleable type like 'dict_keys' in a Q object causes the operation to fail. 2. Review Current Context: The currently identified files and code spans are in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', which includes spans for 'Query', 'Query.combine', 'Query.build_filter', 'Query._add_q', and 'Query.split_exclude'. These methods are relevant for understanding how Q objects are combined and how filters are built in Django's ORM. 3. Process New Search Results: 3.1 Analyzed each code span in the search results. Relevant spans include 'Q' and 'QuerySet' in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/query.py', respectively. These are crucial for understanding the definition and usage of Q objects and QuerySets. 3.2 Matched code spans with key elements from the reported issue, particularly the handling of Q objects for filtering and pickling issues. 3.3 Evaluated relevance based on alignment with the reported issue. Notably, 'Q' and 'QuerySet' are directly related to the use of Q objects and their pickleability. 3.4 Identified potential new functionality or classes, such as improved handling of non-pickleable objects in Q objects. 3.5 Reviewed entire code sections, including 'QuerySet.__init__', 'QuerySet.__getstate__', and 'QuerySet.__setstate__' to ensure a comprehensive understanding of how QuerySets handle state and serialization. 3.6 Verified related parts of the codebase, such as 'SimpleTemplateResponse' in 'django/template/response.py', though not directly related, might influence broader context of handling responses in Django. 3.7 Extracted relevant code spans, focusing on those that directly address the reported issue of pickling errors with Q objects.",
