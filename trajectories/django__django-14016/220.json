Specifically, the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and related methods in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' are good starting points.",

This error occurs due to the inability to pickle such objects, which is required for certain operations involving Q objects. The search results provide several relevant sections of code: 1. Class `Q` definition in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', which includes methods `__or__`, `__and__`, and `__init__`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the Q object handles combination operations using '|' and '&'. 2. The `Query` class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', which includes methods `combine`, `build_filter`, and `_add_q`. These methods are responsible for combining queries and building filters, which is directly related to the functionality of the Q object. The `combine` method specifically handles combining two queries with a given connector, which is relevant to understanding how the '|' operator might fail due to the issues with pickleability. The `build_filter` and `_add_q` methods are also relevant as they build and add filters to queries, which could involve Q objects. Therefore, these sections of code are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be included in the identified spans.",
