Given that the error message specifically mentions 'TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object', it suggests that the issue arises during the serialization process, possibly when Django tries to serialize a Q object that contains a non-pickleable object like dict_keys. To investigate further, it is necessary to look into Django's serialization and pickling mechanisms, specifically how Django handles objects during these processes and what checks or modifications might be needed to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully, such as implementing a custom serialization or pickling method for specific non-pickleable objects encountered within a Q object.",
