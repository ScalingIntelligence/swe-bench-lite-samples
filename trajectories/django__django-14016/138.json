'Q' class definition which includes the '|' (Q.__or__) and '&' (Q.__and__) operations. These methods are crucial as they interact directly with the operands and might be handling the combination logic and possibly triggering the error during pickling. \n\n2. 'Query' class and its methods, such as 'combine' and 'build_filter', which are likely to be involved in processing or adding Q objects to a query. Understanding how these methods interact with or manipulate Q objects, particularly during query construction, is essential. \n\n3. The 'JoinPromoter' class may assist in analyzing how joins and combinations are managed and if it plays a role in the pickling process. \n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can pinpoint the exact code spans related to Q object combination and its handling of potentially non-pickleable objects, which are directly relevant to solving the reported issue.",
