This error occurs because 'dict_keys' is not pickleable, which is problematic when attempting to combine Q objects using the '|' operator. The relevant files identified so far include django/db/models/query.py, django/db/models/query_utils.py, and django/db/models/sql/query.py, which deal with QuerySets, Q objects, and SQL query handling, respectively. To address this issue, more specific search parameters focusing on the Q class and its methods like __or__, __and__, and __invert__ within django/db/models/query_utils.py are required, along with examining the pickling logic within the context of this part of the ORM.",

The '_combine' method checks if the other object is an instance of 'Q' and raises a 'TypeError' if it is not. This logic suggests that non-Q objects being passed to this method could be the root cause of the pickling error. To address this, it is crucial to investigate how such non-pickleable objects like 'dict_keys' are being introduced into the Q object combination process. Additionally, examining the 'add' method in the 'Q' class and its handling of different object types will help in understanding how such objects could trigger a pickling error.

The search results include the Q class definition and related methods such as __init__, _combine, __or__, __and__, __invert__, resolve_expression, and deconstruct. These methods are essential for understanding the operation and construction of Q objects and how they interact with other objects. The method _combine is particularly relevant as it is used to combine two Q objects, and it includes a TypeError check which might be the source of the issue. Additionally, the __or__ and __and__ methods directly use _combine to handle the | and & operations, making them critical for resolving the reported issue. The __invert__ method and resolve_expression method also contribute to the overall functionality of Q objects, but they are less directly related to the specific error described. Finally, the deconstruct method is used for serialization and may indirectly relate to the pickling issue. Based on this analysis, the identified spans cover the methods most relevant to the issue, making the search task complete.",

The '_combine' method explicitly checks if the 'other' object is an instance of 'Q' and raises a TypeError if not, which aligns with the reported issue. The handling of non-pickleable objects like 'dict_keys' is not directly addressed in the provided file context. However, the structure and logic for handling Q objects and their combinations suggest a clear path for further investigation and potential enhancement to handle such objects more gracefully. Additionally, there is a need to look into the 'add' method in the 'Q' class and the overall handling of different object types to understand how and why non-pickleable objects are being introduced into the Q object combination process.

The key components of the issue are the Q class, the _combine method, and the __or__ and __and__ methods which handle the combination of Q objects. The current context and search results both provide the implementation of these methods in the Q class. The issue likely arises when trying to combine Q objects that contain non-pickleable objects, and the current implementation does not handle such cases. The provided code spans from the search results include the relevant methods (_combine, __or__, __and__) and do not show any handling for the pickleability of objects within the Q object. Therefore, the identified code spans should cover these methods to understand their behavior and to potentially add a fix for handling non-pickleable objects within the Q object. Additionally, other parts of the code related to resolving expressions and deconstructing the Q object might also need similar checks or modifications to ensure they handle non-pickleable objects properly. Since the current context and search results cover the methods involved in combining Q objects, it is clear that these are the key areas to focus on for addressing the issue.",

This method could be crucial in understanding how non-pickleable objects are handled within the 'Q' class. Additionally, since the '_combine' method is part of the process that leads to the error, understanding how exceptions are handled during the pickling process within the 'Q' class would be important for managing such errors.
