The issue can be resolved by not using .keys() on a dictionary within a Q object, but it is suggested that it should not crash the system. Looking through the search results, the relevant code spans are primarily in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' for the Q class operations such as '__or__', '__and__', and '_combine' methods. These methods are essential for handling the combination of Q objects using logical operators. Additional context in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' provides insight into how queries are combined and managed, which is crucial for understanding potential issues when combining Q objects containing non-pickleable elements. The '__reduce__' method in the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' and the 'Field' class in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' also seem relevant as they deal with object serialization and could potentially be affected by the pickle issue. However, the '__reduce__' methods in these classes might not directly solve the pickle issue but are important for a broader understanding of Django's model serialization behavior.",

This issue arises when attempting to use a non-pickleable type, such as dict_keys, in a Q object. The analysis focuses on identifying relevant code spans and files where such operations occur within Django's ORM and query utils. This includes examining the Q class and its associated methods in django/db/models/query_utils.py, specifically focusing on methods like __init__, __or__, __and__, _combine, and perhaps related functionalities such as pickle operations in the Model class and Field class, as seen in django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/fields/__init__.py. Beyond these, relevant search results also point to django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py and django/db/models/utils.py, though their direct relevance to the reported issue with pickle operations, specifically in relation to the Q object, needs to be evaluated. Thus, the task involves not just identifying code spans related to the Q object but also evaluating whether other components of the Django ORM or utilities might have a bearing on resolving such issues.",
