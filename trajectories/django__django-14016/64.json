The key elements identified from the issue are the Q class, the | operator, and the handling of non-pickleable objects. From the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are located in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' where the Q class and its methods (like __or__, __and__, _combine, etc.) are defined, and in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' where the Query class and its methods (like combine, build_filter, _add_q) are defined. These methods are crucial for combining Q objects and building filters, which are directly related to the reported issue. No new functionality is suggested in the issue, so there's no need to look for code to implement new features. The analysis of the search results shows that the relevant code spans include the methods mentioned above, which handle the combination and manipulation of Q objects and are thus directly relevant to the reported issue.",
