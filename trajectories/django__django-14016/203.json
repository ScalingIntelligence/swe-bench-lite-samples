This is relevant to the sections of code that handle the combining of Q objects using the | operator (bitwise OR) and the initialization and combination of query objects. The 'Q._combine' method and 'Q.__or__' method are directly involved in handling the combination of Q objects using the OR operator, which is explicitly mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the 'Query.combine' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is related as it handles the combination of query objects, which may also be indirectly affected by the inability to pickle certain objects. These sections of code are thus identified as relevant to addressing the issue.
