The relevant code spans are primarily located in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files. The `Q` class and its methods (`__init__`, `_combine`, `__or__`, `__and__`, `__invert__`, `resolve_expression`, `deconstruct`) in `query_utils.py` handle the core logic of Q objects, including combination and negation. In `query.py`, the `Query` class and its methods (`__init__`, `combine`, `build_filter`, `_add_q`) deal with the SQL query construction and handling Q objects within the context of database queries. These sections are relevant because they directly involve the combination and handling of Q objects, which is where the error reported occurs.

The issue specifically occurs when a non-pickleable object, such as dict_keys, is used within a Q object. This results in the Q object being unable to be pickled, causing the error when attempting to use the | operator. The issue suggests that the .keys() method should be supported without crashing. From the search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' files. These files contain the definitions and implementations of the Q class and its operations (__or__, __and__, _combine, etc.), as well as the Query class which handles the filtering and combining of Q objects. The identified code spans include the initialization of the Q class, its combination methods, and the handling of filter expressions and queries within the Query class. These code spans are crucial for understanding how Q objects are created, combined, and processed in Django, and are directly related to the reported issue of pickling errors with the | operator. Additional functions such as 'get_expr_references' in the Model class are also relevant, as they provide insight into how expressions involving Q objects are processed and potentially pickled. Overall, these code spans cover the fundamental aspects of the Q object and Query handling, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",
