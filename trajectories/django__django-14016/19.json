This suggests that the problem lies in the implementation of the Q object and its interaction with the | operator. Given the context, the focus should be on the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' file which contains the Q class implementation and its methods such as __or__ and __and__. Additionally, the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file is relevant as it contains the Query class which might handle the combination logic for Q objects. The search should be targeted towards understanding how Q objects are combined and ensuring that non-pickleable objects are handled gracefully.",

The current file context and search results directly relate to the functionality of the Q object in handling query expressions, which makes these sections highly relevant for diagnosing and potentially patching this issue. Notably, the Q class methods such as __or__, _combine, and __init__ are directly involved in the concatenation and combination of query expressions, making them critical for understanding and resolving the pickle issue.
