The error occurs because the Q object is trying to pickle a non-pickleable type, specifically 'dict_keys'. This suggests that the error might be occurring in the Q class logic or in the deep copy or serialization logic. Relevant files include 'query_utils.py', 'query.py', and possibly 'base.py' as they deal with query construction and model management. Additionally, 'expressions.py' and 'utils.py' might be relevant for copied/serialized objects.\n\nTo solve this issue, we should focus on the Q class in 'query_utils.py', the Query class in 'query.py', and any related deep copy/serialization mechanisms in 'expressions.py' and 'utils.py'. The specific method of interest in 'query_utils.py' is '__or__' for the Q class, as it deals with the | operator. In 'query.py', the 'combine' method in the Query class is pertinent, as it handles combination logic.",

The error arises specifically when the Q object contains a reference to a non-pickleable type, such as 'dict_keys'. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that are likely to be involved in the implementation of the Q class and its combination methods. The code spans include the Q class definition, the _combine method used for combining Q objects, and the __or__ method that implements the bitwise OR operator. These are directly related to the functionality mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the Q class methods for initialization, expression resolution, and deconstruction are also present, providing a comprehensive overview of how Q objects are handled in the Django framework. None of the other files or code spans in the provided search results appear to be directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, based on the analysis of the search results, it is likely that the identified code spans within the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' file are sufficient to address the reported issue regarding the Q object and the 'cannot pickle' error.",

The 'dict_keys' object being non-pickleable is a central concern. \n\nIn the current file context, we have detailed spans of the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', including how it handles combining with the | operator ('__or__'), and the '_combine' method which is crucial for understanding the error's root cause. \n\nExamining the new search results, 'django/db/models/base.py' includes an import statement for Q and uses it in the context of defining a Model class. While this usage aligns indirectly with the reported issue, it does not specifically address the pickleability concern.\n\nThe file 'django/db/models/expressions.py' also imports Q, indicating that Q is used in query expressions, which is relevant but does not directly contribute to solving the pickleability issue.\n\nLastly, 'django/db/models/utils.py' does not relate to the Q object or the pickleability issue, focusing on utility functions unrelated to the problem at hand.\n\nGiven the focus on the Q object's handling of non-pickleable objects and the methods involved in combining Q objects ('__or__' and '_combine'), the relevant code spans from the original context remain the most pertinent.",
