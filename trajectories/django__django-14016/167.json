This error occurs because the `dict_keys` object is not pickleable, which is required for the Q object to be used in certain operations. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the Q object and its combination with the | operator. The search results include several relevant files: 'django/db/models/query.py', 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', 'django/db/models/base.py', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', 'django/db/models/expressions.py', and 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py'. The most relevant code spans are those that define or interact with the Q class and its methods such as `__init__`, `_combine`, `__or__`, `__and__`, `__invert__`, `resolve_expression`, and `deconstruct`. Additionally, the code spans that handle deep copying, pickling, and state management also play a crucial role in this issue. For example, the `__deepcopy__` and `__getstate__` methods in classes like QuerySet, Q, and Model are relevant because they involve pickling operations that could potentially fail due to the unpickleable `dict_keys` object. By identifying these code spans, we can pinpoint the exact places in the codebase where the error might occur and where a potential fix should be applied.",
