This class defines methods like __or__, __and__, and _combine, which are directly relevant to the issue as they handle combining Q objects using the | and & operators. The _combine method, in particular, is central to understanding and potentially fixing the issue, as it is responsible for combining two Q objects. Additionally, the __init__ method and deconstruct method are also relevant as they deal with initializing and serializing Q objects, potentially involving pickle operations. The resolve_expression method, while not directly related to the pickling issue, is part of the Q object's lifecycle and hence relevant for a complete understanding of the codebase.

The error occurs specifically when using a non-pickleable type like dict_keys in a Q object. The provided file context and search results both point to the same file 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', which contains the definition of the Q class and its methods. The methods __or__, __and__, __invert__, _combine, and __init__ are particularly relevant as they involve combining or modifying Q objects. These methods should be examined to see if they handle non-pickleable objects gracefully. Given that the issue involves pickling, the relevant code spans include the initializer __init__, which sets up the Q object, and the _combine method, which combines two Q objects. Additionally, the __or__ and __and__ methods directly involve combining Q objects using OR and AND logic, respectively. The issue with pickling indicates that these methods might not be adequately checking or handling the types of objects being combined, leading to the TypeError. Further, the resolve_expression method is also included as it plays a role in how Q objects are processed within queries, and understanding how expressions are resolved might offer insights into the pickling issue. This thorough examination of the methods within the Q class has identified the relevant code spans that need to be addressed to fix the reported issue.",
