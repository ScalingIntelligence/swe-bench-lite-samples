This error occurs due to the use of a non-pickleable type, specifically `dict_keys`, which is not supported in the context of a Q object. The search results and file context provided focus on the Q class and its methods, particularly `__or__` and `__and__`, which are directly related to the operator in question. The search results confirm the existence of the `__or__` and `__and__` methods in the Q class, and the `__init__` method to initialize the Q object. This aligns well with the reported issue, suggesting that any changes to handle non-pickleable objects would need to be addressed within these methods. The provided code spans are sufficient to understand the implementation and potentially address the issue, making the search task complete.",
