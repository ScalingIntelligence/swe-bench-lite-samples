This issue could potentially lie in the implementation of the Q class itself, especially in methods that handle combining Q objects using the '|' operator. The search results include the Q class definition and its methods which are highly relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, the __init__ and __or__ methods of the Q class would be important to look at for potential fixes or issues related to the pickle operation. Understanding the entire context, including how children elements are managed and how combinations are processed, is crucial. Since the issue involves specific handling of dictionaries and their keys during these operations, diving deeper into these methods is necessary. Therefore, my assessment focuses on these two methods as primary candidates for understanding and resolving the reported issue.",
