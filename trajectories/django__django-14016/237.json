The error occurs specifically when trying to use a non-pickleable object like 'dict_keys' within a Q object. The user suggests that using .keys() should work without causing the error. The current analysis of the codebase shows that the Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' is responsible for creating and combining Q objects using the | operator, which triggers the __or__ method. This method calls the _combine method, which checks the type of the combined object and raises a TypeError if it's not a Q object. The issue seems to be related to the fact that 'dict_keys' is not pickleable and thus cannot be processed correctly by the Q object. To address this, we need to find a way to handle non-pickleable objects within the Q object logic, possibly by implementing additional checks or making 'dict_keys' objects pickleable. The provided search results reaffirm the existing context, showing the Q class and its methods responsible for combining Q objects, along with the potential TypeError when combining non-Q objects. Further work on handling non-pickleable objects within the Q object would likely involve changes to the _combine method or additional methods within the Q class.",
