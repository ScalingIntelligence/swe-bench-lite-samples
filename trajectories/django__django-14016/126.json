The identified spans within the Q class cover methods such as __or__, __and__, _combine, and __init__, which are all involved in combining and manipulating Q objects. These methods are directly relevant to the reported issue as they handle the logic of combining Q objects, where the TypeError could arise if one of the objects involved is not pickleable. Additionally, the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py and the JoinPromoter class are also relevant contexts as they involve query combination and join operations, which could be affected by the pickleability of objects within Q objects.
