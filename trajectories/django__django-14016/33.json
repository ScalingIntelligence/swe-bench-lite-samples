Given the context, this likely includes functions or methods dealing with object state handling during pickling and/or serialization processes. The relevant files and spans are found in the search results: 'django/db/models/base.py' contains spans handling model state and Q object expression references; 'django/db/models/field/__init__.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py' both include spans dealing with deep copying fields and related objects which are relevant for understanding how objects are safely copied or serialized.
