The relevant code spans are primarily located in the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' file, specifically the Q class and its methods including `__init__`, `_combine`, `__or__`, `__and__`, and `__invert__`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the Q object combines conditions using the bitwise operators. Additionally, the 'django/db/models/query.py' file contains the QuerySet class and its methods like `__and__` and `__or__`, which also involve combining queries. These components are directly related to the functionality of combining Q objects and thus are pertinent to the reported issue. The presence of 'dict_keys' in the Q object seems to be causing the issue because it isn't pickleable, which is relevant to how Django might be attempting to serialize objects during query operations. Therefore, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the methods used for combining queries and handling Q objects, which are central to addressing the reported issue.",

This issue seems to relate directly to the implementation and functionality of the Q class in Django's ORM. My task is to identify relevant code spans from the given search results that pertain to the functionality of the Q object, particularly regarding how it handles combination operations (i.e., __or__ and __and__ methods) and how it might handle non-pickleable objects. The search results provide the full implementation of the Q class, including its __init__, _combine, __or__, __and__, __invert__, resolve_expression, and deconstruct methods. Relevant spans include those where the Q object is combined with another Q object or where the Q object is manipulated in a way that might affect pickleability. These spans give a comprehensive view of how the Q object works and where adjustments might be necessary to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully without raising a TypeError. Based on the search results and the context provided, all code spans related to the Q class are relevant.",

Additionally, the QuerySet class in 'django/db/models/query.py' contains methods for combining querysets using 'AND' (__and__) and 'OR' (__or__) operators. The presence of these methods suggests that the framework is designed to handle the merging of Q objects and querysets, which is relevant to the reported issue.
