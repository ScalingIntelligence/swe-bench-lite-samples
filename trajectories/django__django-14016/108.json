This error occurs because the Q object is attempting to combine a non-pickleable object, specifically 'dict_keys', which leads to a failure in the combination process. The search results provided contain relevant code spans from the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' files, which are central to the functionality of the Q object and its combination logic. The identified spans include the definition of the Q class, its combination methods (_combine, __or__, __and__), and the _add_q method which is involved in the process of adding Q objects to the query. These spans are directly relevant to the reported issue as they handle the logic for combining Q objects and could potentially be the location of the error when attempting to combine a Q object containing a non-pickleable object like 'dict_keys'. Additionally, the Query class and its methods, such as build_filter and _add_q, are also relevant as they manage the construction and modification of queries, which is where the error is surfaced during the combination process. Given the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue and the central role they play in the query construction and combination logic, it is concluded that the relevant code spans have been identified.",
