The issue specifically mentions non-pickleable objects like dict_keys causing the error. This suggests that the problem might lie in the handling of the Q object's attributes or in how the | operator is implemented for the Q object. From the search results, we can see that the Q class is located in django/db/models/query_utils.py, and it includes methods such as __or__ and __and__, which are directly relevant to the | operator. Additionally, the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py also has a __or__ method that combines QuerySet objects, though it primarily deals with QuerySet objects rather than the Q objects directly. Given the specificity of the issue, the focus should be on the Q class and its methods in query_utils.py. The _combine method within the Q class is particularly relevant as it is used by the __or__ method to combine two Q objects. The identified code spans include the initialization of the Q object, the _combine method, and the __or__ method, which are directly relevant to the reported issue.",
