This error occurs in the context of Django's ORM, where Q objects are used for complex queries. To address this, it is necessary to identify the relevant parts of the codebase where Q objects are combined using the | operator and where the pickling process might be failing.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it is clear that the core functionality related to the Q object and its combination with other Q objects using the | operator is primarily found in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file. This file contains the definition of the Q class, including methods for combining Q objects using OR (`__or__` method) and AND (`__and__` method) operations.\n\nAdditionally, the `django/db/models/query.py` file contains the QuerySet class, which also implements the `__or__` and `__and__` methods for combining QuerySets. The `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file is also relevant, as it contains the Query class which is responsible for combining SQL queries.\n\nThe key spans of code to focus on are the implementations of the `__or__` method in the Q class and the corresponding implementation in the Query and QuerySet classes. These methods define the behavior of combining Q objects and QuerySets using the | operator. It is in these methods that the issue of combining Q objects containing non-pickleable types is most likely to manifest.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans of code are:\n- `django/db/models/query_utils.py`: Q.__or__\n- `django/db/models/query.py`: QuerySet.__or__\n- `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: Query.combine\n- `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: Query._add_q\n- `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: Query.build_filter\n\nThese spans are relevant because they directly involve the combination of Q objects and QuerySets, which is where the TypeError is occurring. By examining and potentially modifying these sections, it should be possible to address the issue of combining Q objects containing unpickleable types without causing a TypeError.",
