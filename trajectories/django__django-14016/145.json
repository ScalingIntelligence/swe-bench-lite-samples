            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the 'TypeError: cannot pickle' error when using the | operator on a Q object in Django. The specific problematic code involves using a non-pickleable object like 'dict_keys' within a Q object, causing the | operator to fail. This issue could potentially be addressed in the Django framework's code, particularly around the Q object and its methods for combining queries. Upon analyzing the provided search results from 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', we find several relevant code spans:\n\n1. The 'Q' class definition, which is pivotal for understanding how query objects are structured and combined.\n\n2. The '__init__' method of the 'Q' class, which initializes the Q object. This is relevant because improper initialization could lead to issues with non-pickleable objects.\n\n3. The '__or__' method, which is directly related to the error since it is the operation that causes the crash when a non-pickleable object is involved. This method combines two Q objects using the OR logic, which aligns with the operator in question.\n\nGiven these findings, it seems reasonable to assume that modifying or enhancing the behavior of the '__or__' method might be one approach to resolving the issue, assuming that the combination logic could be revised to better handle non-pickleable objects. Additionally, a more comprehensive solution might involve assessing and potentially modifying the '__init__' method to ensure that non-pickleable objects are handled gracefully or prevented from entering the Q object in the first place.\n\nThe relevance of the identified code spans strongly suggests that they are indeed relevant to the reported issue, and thus they should be included in the response for further investigation or modification by any subsequent patches or enhancements.",
