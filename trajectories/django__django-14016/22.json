The issue specifically mentions the use of a non-pickleable object (dict_keys) within a Q object causing the TypeError. The provided search results include key sections of code from the Django framework where the Q class is defined and methods like __or__, __and__, and combine are implemented to handle the logical combination of Q objects. These methods are crucial for understanding how Q objects are combined and need to be audited to ensure they properly handle picklable and non-pickleable objects. The code spans for Q.__or__, Q.__and__, and Query.combine are particularly relevant as they directly involve the combination logic and need to be reviewed to ensure they don't introduce or propagate errors related to pickling. Additionally, the Query._add_q method is relevant as it builds filters based on Q objects and might need adjustments to handle non-picklable objects gracefully. These identified code spans provide a starting point for implementing a patch to ensure that using non-pickleable objects within Q objects does not result in a TypeError.",
