The Q class includes methods for combining Q objects, such as __or__, __and__, and __invert__, which are integral to investigating the handling of these objects. Additionally, methods within the QuerySet class, such as __deepcopy__, __getstate__, and __setstate__, address the serialization and deserialization of these objects, a critical area for managing potential errors related to non-pickleable objects. These methods are key to understanding how Django processes these objects during serialization and deserialization. Despite this detailed context, specific handling for non-pickleable 'dict_keys' objects within these methods is not explicitly provided, suggesting that further investigation into these methods might yield more relevant code or insight.",
