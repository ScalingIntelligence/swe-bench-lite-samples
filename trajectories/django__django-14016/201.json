The spans 'QuerySet.__or__', 'Q.__or__', and 'Query.combine' are particularly relevant as they deal with the combination of queries using the OR operator. Additionally, the '__deepcopy__' methods in 'QuerySet' and 'Query' might be relevant due to the pickleability issue. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how query combinations and object copying are handled in Django's ORM.
