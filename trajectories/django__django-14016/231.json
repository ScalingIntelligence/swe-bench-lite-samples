This suggests that the pickle module is encountering an issue when trying to serialize a Q object that contains a reference to a non-pickleable type such as dict_keys. The relevant files based on the provided context are mainly in the django/db/models directory, focusing on query.py, query_utils.py, and expressions.py. The specific function of interest is likely to be related to the Q object's __or__ method or any other method involved in combining Q objects or serializing them. To pinpoint the exact location and possible fix, searching for methods or code patterns that handle the combination of Q objects and their serialization is crucial.",
