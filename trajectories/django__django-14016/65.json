The search results include several relevant files and spans within the Django codebase that are likely related to the handling of Q objects and queries. The spans in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' are particularly relevant as they contain definitions and methods for the Q class and Query class, respectively. These are fundamental to understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the | operator. The inclusion of spans like 'Q.__init__' in 'query_utils.py' and 'Query.combine' in 'query.py' suggests that these sections are central to how Q objects and query combinations are handled. Examining these sections thoroughly will help in determining if they directly address or contribute to the reported issue. The other spans in these files also provide context for how queries and Q objects interact, which is crucial for a full understanding of the problem. Based on this analysis, the task is not yet complete as more detailed inspection and possibly further searching within these identified sections may be necessary.",
