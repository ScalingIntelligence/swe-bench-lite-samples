In the search results, we found the definition of the Q class and its methods, including __init__ and __or__. The __or__ method is particularly important as it is used for the | operator with Q objects. The span with the __or__ method definition seems most relevant to the issue, as it directly addresses how the | operator is handled with Q objects.
