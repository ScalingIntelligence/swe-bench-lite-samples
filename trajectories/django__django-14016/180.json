The error occurs during the pickling process, which is likely handled in the Q class or its associated methods. To address this, it's necessary to focus on the Q class and its methods for handling operators like '|' and 'and', as well as any methods related to pickling objects. Additionally, the code responsible for handling expressions and queries, such as in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly processes and combines Q objects. The potential fix might involve checking types before attempting to combine or pickle them, or adjusting the handling of Q objects to manage non-pickleable types more gracefully.",

The Q class definition, its various methods (__init__, _combine, __or__, __and__, __invert__, resolve_expression, and deconstruct), and how they handle combining Q objects or inverting them, could all be directly related to the issue. The '__or__' method is particularly pertinent as it is used to implement the | operator, which is at the core of the reported issue. The '_combine' method also plays a key role in combining Q objects, directly addressing the functionality where the error occurs. The 'deconstruct' method might also be relevant if it involves pickling or representation of the Q object.\n\nGiven these insights, it's clear that the entire Q class and its methods are highly relevant to resolving the issue of pickling errors when using the | operator.
