The specific error occurs in the part of the code handling the | (OR) operator on Q objects. This issue is critical for Django's ORM functionality because it inhibits the ability to perform complex queries with elements that are not pickleable. Thus, the relevant code spans should involve the Q class and its methods, particularly those involved in combination operations like __or__.

This issue arises due to the use of a non-pickleable object, such as dict_keys, within a Q object. The analysis of the provided search results and file context reveals the following key points:\n\n1. The Q class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' is involved in defining the behavior of the | operator for combining Q objects. The '__or__' method is particularly relevant, as it is responsible for combining two Q objects using the OR logic.\n\n2. The 'Query' class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' has methods '_add_q', 'combine', and 'split_exclude', which are involved in handling complex query combinations and are likely related to the Q object combination.\n\n3. The 'QuerySet' class in 'django/db/models/query.py' is used to handle queries and includes methods for pickling and unpickling, which may be relevant to the pickle error encountered.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans are identified within the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', and 'django/db/models/query.py' files, specifically the Q class methods and the QuerySet class methods related to pickling. Additionally, the 'Prefetch' class in 'django/db/models/query.py' is relevant for handling query prefetching, although not directly connected to the pickle error.",
