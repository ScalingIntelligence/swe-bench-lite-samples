This error arises specifically from the attempt to use a non-pickleable object like 'dict_keys' within a Q object. Given this information, our focus should be on the Q class and its operations, particularly those involving the __or__ method or _combine method, which are central to the | operation. In the provided code, we find several relevant sections within the Q class in the 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' file: the __init__ method, the _combine method, and the __or__ method. These methods directly relate to the creation, combination, and specifically the bitwise OR operation of Q objects, which are fundamentally tied to the reported issue. The other files and spans of code do not directly address the specific issue of pickling error in Q objects when using the | operator, and therefore are not as relevant to the immediate problem.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the broader context of pickling and what objects can and cannot be pickled (such as 'dict_keys') is important for resolving the error. It suggests that when combining Q objects, particularly in the __or__ or _combine methods, handling of non-pickleable objects should be addressed to prevent TypeErrors. Thus, careful examination of the Q class methods for code spans that directly address combinations of Q objects and could possibly handle or avoid the input of non-pickleable objects is crucial.",
