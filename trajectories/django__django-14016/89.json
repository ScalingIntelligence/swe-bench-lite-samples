The search task involves finding relevant code spans within the Django codebase related to Q objects and their interaction with the | operator. After examining the search results, the following insights were drawn:\n\n1. The `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file contains the `Q` class, which is central to the issue. This includes the `Q.__init__`, `Q._combine`, `Q.__or__`, `Q.__and__`, and `Q.__invert__` methods. These methods are directly involved in defining how Q objects combine with the | and & operators, which are crucial for resolving the reported error.\n\n2. The `django/db/models/query.py` file contains the `QuerySet` class, specifically the `QuerySet.__init__`, `QuerySet.__and__`, and `QuerySet.__or__` methods. These methods manage how QuerySets are combined using the & and | operators, which might affect how Q objects are combined within QuerySets.\n\n3. The `django/contrib/sessions/serializers.py` file includes a `PickleSerializer` class that shows how objects are serialized using the `pickle` module. This context is useful because the error is related to pickling, and understanding Django's approach to pickling might help find a solution or a workaround.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified code spans in the `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and `django/db/models/query.py` files are relevant and directly contribute to resolving the reported issue. Other files, like `django/contrib/sessions/serializers.py`, provide additional context that helps understand the overall framework's behavior concerning serialized objects.\n\nThe identified code spans show a clear interaction of the Q object with the | operator, which directly addresses the TypeError concerning pickling.",

The provided search results give a closer look into the Q class and its methods, specifically __or__ and _combine, which are directly involved in implementing the bitwise OR operation (|). Additionally, the search results also include parts of the Model class and its methods (__getstate__ and __setstate__), which are relevant because they deal with pickling and unpickling of objects. Since the issue concerns the pickling process, these methods are certainly relevant to the analysis. However, it does not seem to give a direct solution to the specific case of Q objects and 'dict_keys'.
