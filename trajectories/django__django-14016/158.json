Additionally, in 'base.py', the Model class and its methods related to pickling (__getstate__ and __setstate__) are included. While the direct issue with the '|' operator might be in the Q class methods, understanding how pickling works in the Model class could also be relevant, especially if the Q object is involved in model operations.
