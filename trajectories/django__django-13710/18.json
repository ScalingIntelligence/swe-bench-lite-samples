The current implementation does not automatically set verbose_name_plural based on the specified verbose_name, leading to inconsistencies and confusion. The proposed solution suggests that verbose_name_plural should default to the specified verbose_name if provided. To address this, it is necessary to locate the relevant methods and properties in the InlineModelAdmin class and possibly related classes like ModelAdmin and BaseModelAdmin. Additionally, examining the formset generation and admin utility functions may be beneficial to understand the full context and scope of potential changes.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the behavior of verbose_name and verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in Django admin views. The current implementation does not base verbose_name_plural on verbose_name for Inlines, which is inconsistent with how models handle these attributes. The patch aims to align the behavior of Inline classes with models by defaulting verbose_name_plural to be based on verbose_name if specified. The search results reveal several relevant code spans in the django/contrib/admin/options.py file, particularly within the ModelAdmin and InlineModelAdmin classes, where the handling of inline instances, formsets, and permissions are defined. These sections of code are directly involved in managing inline admin functionalities, including the rendering and processing of forms for related models. Specifically, the methods _create_formsets, get_inline_instances, and get_inline_formsets in ModelAdmin, and get_extra, get_max_num, get_formset in InlineModelAdmin, are highly relevant. Additionally, the django/forms/models.py file contains BaseModelFormSet and BaseInlineFormSet classes which are foundational for form handling in the admin, especially for managing formsets for inline models. Lastly, the utils.py file provides utility functions used across the admin, including model_ngettext which helps in getting the correct plural form of model names. All these sections are crucial for understanding and implementing the proposed change, as they deal with the actual rendering and management of inline model forms and their metadata in the Django admin.",

Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
