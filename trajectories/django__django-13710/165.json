The search results contain relevant code spans within the InlineModelAdmin class, particularly in the '__init__' and 'get_formset' methods, which initialize and set up the InlineModelAdmin instance. These sections of code handle the verbose_name and verbose_name_plural attributes, indicating where the proposed change could be implemented: specifically, in the logic that sets verbose_name_plural if it is not explicitly defined. By examining these spans, it's clear that this codebase could benefit from an adjustment to ensure verbose_name_plural defaults to the verbose_name when the latter is explicitly provided, aligning with the model's Meta behavior.",

Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
