This addresses the inconsistency where the `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline currently defaults to the model name or a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class, rather than the Inline's `verbose_name`. The search results show relevant sections from `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, particularly the `InlineModelAdmin` class and its `__init__` method, which currently initializes `verbose_name_plural` based on the model's Meta class if not explicitly set. This is the exact area where the proposed change should be implemented to default `verbose_name_plural` to `verbose_name` if the latter is specified. Additionally, the `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset` method is highlighted as it constructs the formset for the Inline, potentially where changes could be reflected. Further context in `django/forms/models.py` with the `BaseInlineFormSet` class and its `add_fields` method show additional interactions with the formset that could be affected by this change, although they do not directly address the `verbose_name_plural` issue. The identified spans directly relate to the functionality and setup of Inline models in Django admin, specifically where the proposed default behavior for `verbose_name_plural` should be applied.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
