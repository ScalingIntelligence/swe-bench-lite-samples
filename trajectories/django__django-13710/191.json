Specifically, it proposes that `verbose_name_plural` should default to the `verbose_name` value if specified, rather than relying on the model name or a verbose_name in the model's Meta class. The relevant code to address this is primarily located in the `InlineModelAdmin` class within the `django/contrib/admin/options.py` file. This class is responsible for defining how inline models are handled within the admin interface. The key areas of interest are the `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin`, as it sets up the initial attributes for the class, including `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural`, and where these could potentially be modified to align with the proposed change. Additionally, the `get_formset` method, while not directly related to verbose names, is crucial as it uses these names in the formset it generates for inline models.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
