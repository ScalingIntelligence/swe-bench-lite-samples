The `ModelAdmin` class in the `options.py` file is central to the admin interface, and subclasses like `BaseModelAdmin` would likely have relevant methods. Code spans involving `InlineModelAdmin`, `BaseInlineFormSet`, and other related classes should be examined for potential modifications. We should focus on methods that handle the initialization, permission checks, and form handling for Inlines, as these are likely candidates for the proposed change. The spans 'ModelAdmin.get_inline_instances' and 'ModelAdmin.get_inline_formsets' appear to manage inline instances and formsets, which could be where a change to handle the `verbose_name_plural` defaulting logic would be implemented.",

Currently, `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline is based on the model name or a `verbose_name` specified in the model's Meta class, rather than the Inline's `verbose_name`. To address this, the proposal suggests that `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline should default to the `verbose_name` if specified.\n\nFrom the provided search results and file context, the relevant sections of the codebase to consider for implementing this change are primarily within the `InlineModelAdmin` class and its associated methods. This includes the `__init__` method where `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are initialized, and potentially the `get_formset` method where form handling is defined. The search results confirm the presence of the `InlineModelAdmin` class and its initialization logic, which aligns with the issue's requirements.\n\nA potential patch to implement the proposed change would involve modifying the `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` to set `verbose_name_plural` to `verbose_name` if `verbose_name` is provided and `verbose_name_plural` is not explicitly set. This would ensure that `verbose_name_plural` defaults intelligently based on the `verbose_name`, as desired by the issue.\n\nThese considerations and steps outline a systematic approach to identify the relevant code sections and prepare for a patch that would implement the desired functionality.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
