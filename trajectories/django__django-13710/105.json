This would align the behavior with that of `ModelAdmin` classes, where the plural form automatically follows the singular form if it's provided. To address this, it's necessary to identify where `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are defined and used within the `InlineModelAdmin` class. In the provided search results, several relevant code spans are found:\n\n1. In `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, the `InlineModelAdmin` class defines `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` with defaults. This is the primary area for potential modification: span ID 'InlineModelAdmin.__init__'.\n2. Also in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, the `ModelAdmin` class and its interaction with `InlineModelAdmin` instances are defined. Specifically, the `get_inline_instances` method demonstrates how inline instances are treated: span ID 'ModelAdmin.get_inline_instances'.\n3. The `model_format_dict` and `model_ngettext` functions in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` handle formatting for model objects, which is relevant for how `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` might be used in templates or elsewhere: span ID 'model_format_dict' and 'model_ngettext'.\n\nThese spans indicate key areas where changes could be made or referenced to adjust the default behavior of `verbose_name_plural` for `InlineModelAdmin` based on the provided `verbose_name`.",

  "initial_message": "Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural\nDescription\n\t\nDjango allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
