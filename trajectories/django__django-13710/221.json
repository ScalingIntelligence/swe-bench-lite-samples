The current implementation sets verbose_name_plural based on the model name or a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. The issue suggests that this behavior is inconsistent with the model's Meta class, which automatically bases the plural form on a specified verbose_name. The relevant code spans identified are in the `django/contrib/admin/options.py` file, particularly within the `InlineModelAdmin` class. The `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` seems particularly relevant as it currently initializes verbose_name and verbose_name_plural based on model metadata if they are not explicitly set. This is where the proposed change would need to be implemented to default verbose_name_plural to the plural form of verbose_name if verbose_name is specified.

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
