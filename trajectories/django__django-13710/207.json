The issue suggests that the verbose_name_plural for an Inline should default to the verbose_name if specified, which is not the current behavior. From the provided search results, we can see several key sections in 'django/contrib/admin/options.py' and 'django/forms/models.py'. In 'options.py', the 'InlineModelAdmin' class defines both 'verbose_name' and 'verbose_name_plural', and the '__init__' method sets these based on the model's Meta class, but it does not currently default 'verbose_name_plural' based on 'verbose_name'. Additionally, the 'get_formset' method in 'InlineModelAdmin' is relevant for form handling. In 'models.py', 'BaseInlineFormSet' and its methods are typically used in conjunction with 'InlineModelAdmin' to handle inline form sets, but they don't directly address the issue of setting 'verbose_name_plural' based on 'verbose_name'. Thus, the primary focus should be on the 'InlineModelAdmin' class in 'options.py', specifically the '__init__' and 'get_formset' methods, to implement the proposed change.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
