The problem arises because verbose_name_plural for an Inline does not default to the specified verbose_name, unlike model's Meta class. To address this, the search should focus on the InlineModelAdmin class and related methods that handle verbose names. Additionally, considering the patch is already written with tests, it's crucial to ensure that both the inline and model verbose name handling are aligned. The search should be directed towards files containing the InlineModelAdmin class, specifically looking for methods and properties that deal with verbose name and plural settings.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
