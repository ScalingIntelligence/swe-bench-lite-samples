Upon examining the search results, I identified the relevant section within the 'InlineModelAdmin' class where the verbose_name and verbose_name_plural attributes are initialized. The current implementation initializes verbose_name_plural from the model's Meta class if not explicitly provided, which aligns with the current behavior described in the issue. A proposed change to set verbose_name_plural based on verbose_name if verbose_name_plural is not specified can be introduced here. Additionally, the context suggests that the changes, including tests, are ready for submission, implying no further immediate action beyond identifying this specific area of interest in the codebase for potential modifications. Given that the specific method to apply the changes was not explicitly described, I concluded that it was not a task focused on implementing precise coding changes but understanding where in the framework code changes might be accepted to shape future behavior.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about making the 'verbose_name_plural' for an Inline class in the Django admin default to the 'verbose_name' if the 'verbose_name_plural' is not specified. This requires modifications in the InlineModelAdmin class. While the current file context already contains relevant code relating to InlineModelAdmin, the search results confirm the presence of the specifics within the InlineModelAdmin class which are critical to understand the context and potentially solve the issue by modifying the behavior of 'verbose_name_plural' initialization. No additional code spans seem relevant beyond what is already in the <file_context> for this particular issue. Therefore, the initial context should suffice to ultimately implement the proposed change.\n\nKey observations:\n- The InlineModelAdmin class is correctly being examined in both the file context and search results.\n- The __init__ method of InlineModelAdmin in the search results indeed sets 'verbose_name' and 'verbose_name_plural' from the model's metadata if they are not explicitly provided, which aligns perfectly with the objective of the reported issue.\n- While the search results provide an extensive overview from the Django admin module, none of the additional spans (`FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS`, `ChangeListSearchForm`, `FilteredSelectMultiple`, `AdminDateWidget`, `AdminTimeWidget`, and `AdminUUIDInputWidget`) address the specific requirement of handling the verbose_name_plural automatically for Inline classes.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
