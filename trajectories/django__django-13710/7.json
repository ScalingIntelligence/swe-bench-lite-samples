The current implementation does not automatically base verbose_name_plural on the specified verbose_name for the Inline, leading to confusion and inconsistency with the model's Meta class. To locate the relevant code, we should focus on Django's admin-related files and specifically on classes and methods handling InlineModelAdmin, such as InlineModelAdmin, ModelAdmin, and their respective methods like get_inline_* and _create_formsets. Additionally, we should look for any utility or helper functions that might be responsible for determining verbose names and their plurals in these contexts.",

This is to align with the behavior of models' Meta class, where the plural form is automatically derived from the specified verbose_name.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, several key areas in the Django source code are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **ModelAdmin class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`**: This class handles the admin interface for models and includes methods for managing inline instances and formsets (e.g., `get_inline_formsets`, `_create_formsets`). These methods are crucial for defining how inline forms are presented and managed in the admin interface.\n\n2. **InlineAdminFormSet and InlineAdminForm classes in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`**: These classes are used to render inline formsets in the admin interface. The `InlineAdminFormSet` class includes methods like `__init__`, `__iter__`, and `inline_formset_data` that are essential for managing and rendering inline forms. The `InlineAdminForm` class is used to manage individual inline forms.\n\n3. **BaseInlineFormSet class in `django/forms/models.py`**: This class is a base implementation for inline formsets and includes initial form count, form construction, and saving new forms, which are crucial for handling inline formsets.\n\n4. **model_ngettext function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`**: This function is used for generating the singular and plural form of the model's verbose name, which might be relevant for displaying the correct form titles in the admin interface.\n\nThese sections of the code are relevant as they involve managing and rendering inline forms, which directly ties to the verbose_name and verbose_name_plural properties affected by the reported issue.",

Specifically, if a `verbose_name` is specified for an Inline, it should be used to derive the `verbose_name_plural` by default, rather than relying on the model name or a `verbose_name_plural` specified in the model's Meta class. The provided file context and search results include essential components for making this change: the definition of `InlineAdminFormSet` in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, which includes methods for initializing and iterating over forms, and for generating formset data. Additionally, there's the definition of `BaseInlineFormSet` in `django/forms/models.py`, which is responsible for creating formsets for inline forms. These classes and methods are central to how inline form data is handled and displayed in the Django admin interface. By focusing on these areas, it will be possible to implement the desired behavior for `verbose_name_plural` based on the `verbose_name` if specified. The `ModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` also provides context on how formsets are handled and displayed within the admin views.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
