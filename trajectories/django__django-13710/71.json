This would bring the behavior of Inline classes in line with that of model Meta classes, which already auto-generate the plural form based on the verbose_name if verbose_name_plural is not specified.\n\nFrom the provided file context, the relevant parts of the code are found in the `InlineModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. Specifically, the `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` initializes `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` based on the model's meta options if they are not specified. However, it does not currently implement the proposed behavior of defaulting `verbose_name_plural` to the `verbose_name` if `verbose_name_plural` is not specified. Additionally, the `media` property, `get_extra`, `get_min_num`, and `get_max_num` methods are relevant as they pertain to the behavior and display of inline admin forms.\n\nIn the search results, the additional code spans provide further context around the `InlineModelAdmin` class, specifically detailing how permissions and formsets are handled. The presence of methods like `has_add_permission`, `has_change_permission`, and `has_delete_permission` show how access controls are implemented for inline models. The `get_formset` method is also crucial as it constructs the formset for the inline model, which involves setting the appropriate fields and handling deletions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans from the `InlineModelAdmin` class in both the provided file context and the search results cover the essential parts of the codebase relevant to the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural\nDescription\n\t\nDjango allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
