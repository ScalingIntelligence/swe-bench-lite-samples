The issue suggests that the current behavior is inconsistent with the approach used in model Meta classes, indicating a need to align the behavior of InlineModelAdmin with that of model Meta classes. The relevant code spans are primarily in the `django/contrib/admin/options.py` file, specifically the definition and initialization of the InlineModelAdmin class. This code can be used to implement the proposed change, setting `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if the latter is specified. Additionally, the `inlineformset_factory` function in `django/forms/models.py` is also relevant as it encapsulates the creation of formsets used by inlines, potentially influencing how verbose names are handled in the admin interface.",

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
