The main concern is that the migrations are using the value of the Enum object instead of its name, which causes errors when the Enum value is translated to another language. The desired solution is to use the name of the Enum instead of its value in the migrations to avoid these issues.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided search results in 'django/db/models/enums.py', it's clear that this file contains the relevant code dealing with Enums and their handling in Django models. Specifically, the 'ChoicesMeta' class and its methods like '__new__', '__contains__', 'names', 'choices', 'labels', and 'values' are closely related to the logic of dealing with Enum types and their values in Django. These sections of code are responsible for how Enum choices are created, managed, and interact with Django's model fields, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those related to the 'ChoicesMeta' class and its methods.",

This causes problems when the Enum values are translated, as the old migration files will raise errors if the translated values no longer match the original Enum values.\n\nThe relevant code spans from the search results that address this issue are in the `ChoicesMeta` class within the `django/db/models/enums.py` file. Specifically, the `__new__` method is responsible for initializing the Enum class and mapping values to labels. This method could be modified to use Enum names instead of values for default settings in migrations to avoid the problem described. Additionally, the `choices` property also uses the Enum values, which could be a point of concern if not addressed.\n\nGiven the current context and the search results, identifying the relevant code spans is crucial to understand how the Enum default values are handled in Django models and migrations. The `choices`, `labels`, and `values` properties of the `ChoicesMeta` class are also relevant as they deal with how Enum values are represented and used in the model choices.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are in the `__new__` method and the properties related to choices representation in the `ChoicesMeta` class.",

This class is relevant to the issue at hand as it deals with how Enum objects are handled in Django models. Additionally, the `ChoicesSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is also relevant as it directly involves the serialization of Enum values during the migration process. This suggests that the file context provided is directly related to the issue of Enum values being used in migrations. Further, the `ChoicesSerializer` class might be the place where modifications are needed to ensure that Enum names are used instead of their values in the migration files. However, the exact point of modification would likely be within the `ChoicesSerializer` class or related methods in the migration serialization process.",

This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. \nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n"
