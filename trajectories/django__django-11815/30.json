The current behavior uses the value of the Enum object rather than its name, causing issues with translation. The goal is to identify the relevant code in the Django codebase that handles the serialization of default values for fields in migrations. \n\nThe search results provide several key sections, notably:\n1. `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` contains various serializers, including `ChoicesSerializer` which might be relevant for handling Enum choices.\n2. `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` contains the `Field` class definition, which includes the `__init__` method where default values are set and the `get_default` method which might be involved in fetching these values. \n\nGiven the issue description, the `ChoicesSerializer.serialize` method in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is a prime candidate for relevance as it directly deals with the serialization of field choices, which could include Enum values. Additionally, since the issue directly relates to how default values are handled in the `Field` class, the `__init__` method and `get_default` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` are also crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior related to default values and their usage in migrations.",

This causes problems when the Enum values are translated, leading to errors in old migration files. The ideal fix would be for the migration code to use the Enum name instead of its translated value. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that handle the serialization of Enum objects in migrations. From the provided context, the 'ChoicesSerializer' class in 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' seems to be involved in serializing Enum values directly. Additionally, the 'Field' class in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' is responsible for handling default values. In the new search results, the 'Field' class again appears, with its 'get_default' method that might be relevant. However, the main focus should be on the 'ChoicesSerializer' and how it serializes Enum values. The 'ModelOperation' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' might also be relevant as it handles model operations during migrations, including creating and renaming models. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py' is also crucial as it is responsible for generating migration files. Given these insights, the identified spans are in 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' for ChoicesSerializer and in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' for Field, specifically focusing on how default values are handled and serialized.",

This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. \nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n"
