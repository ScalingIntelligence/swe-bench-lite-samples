The problem arises when the Enum value is translated, causing inconsistencies in the migration files. The goal is to ensure that the migration files use the Enum's name rather than its translated value to maintain consistency. To address this, we need to focus on the serialization of Enum objects in the migration process. We should search for the `serialize` method in the `ChoicesSerializer` class and related classes in the `django.db.migrations.serializer` module, as this module is responsible for serializing values in migrations. Additionally, we should look at the `BaseSimpleSerializer` class which might handle the serialization of simple values like Enums.",

The `ChoicesSerializer` class, which handles the serialization of Enum objects, inherits from `BaseSerializer`. Looking at the `ChoicesSerializer` class, the `serialize` method directly returns the serialized value of the Enum object, which could potentially lead to issues when the Enum value is translated. To address the described issue, it is crucial to modify the `ChoicesSerializer` class to serialize the Enum's name instead of its value. This modification will ensure that the migration files are consistent regardless of language translations.",

The provided file context and search results primarily focus on the `serializer.py` file within the Django `db/migrations` directory. This file contains several classes that handle the serialization of different types of objects. Among these, the `ChoicesSerializer` and `EnumSerializer` classes are particularly relevant as they deal with enums and choices, which closely relate to the issue at hand. The `ChoicesSerializer.serialize` method specifically calls `serializer_factory(self.value.value).serialize()`, indicating that it uses the value of the enum rather than its name. To resolve the issue, it is necessary to modify the serialization process to output the enum's name instead of its value. This might involve creating or modifying the `EnumSerializer` class to correctly handle the serialization of enum names. Given the search results, the immediate focus should be on enhancing or adapting the `EnumSerializer` class to ensure that when an enum is serialized, its name is used rather than its value.",

This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. \nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n"
