This can lead to issues when the Enum values are translated, causing the migration files to raise errors. The solution suggested is to use the name of the Enum instead of its value in the migrations.\n\nThe current file context and search results provide relevant code spans related to the serialization of Enum objects in migrations and the initialization and default value handling of fields in Django models. Specifically, the `EnumSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` is responsible for serializing Enum objects. The `Field.__init__` and `Field.get_default` methods in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` handle the initialization and default value retrieval of fields.\n\nThese code spans seem relevant to addressing the issue. The `EnumSerializer.serialize` method needs to be modified to use the name of the Enum instead of its value. The `Field.__init__` method involves handling default values, which could also be relevant for correctly initializing fields with Enum objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans should be sufficient to start addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migrations uses value of enum object instead of its name.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by oasl)\n\t \nWhen using Enum object as a default value for a CharField, the generated migration file uses the value of the Enum object instead of the its name. This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. \nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n"
