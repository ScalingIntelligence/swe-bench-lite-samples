The user requires this to be sorted or returned as a set, suggesting a potential modification to avoid test failures.\n\nReviewing the search results, I found the `decompose()` function within the `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` file. The function indeed returns a list of monomial terms from the `poly_dict` when `separate=True`, which can be arbitrarily ordered based on the input expression's structure.\n\nGiven the user's requirement for a sorted output or a set to ensure order doesn't affect the results, the relevant part of the code to focus on is inside the `decompose()` function where the list of monomial terms is created and returned. To address the issue, one could modify this part to ensure the list is sorted or consider returning a set (though practicality of returning a set for this context should be further evaluated).\n\nThe function is also referenced in the `polytope_integrate()` and `main_integrate()` methods, highlighting how it's utilized in integral calculations. Since the issue directly relates to the `decompose()` function's behavior, the identified code spans are the ones within the `decompose()` definition as well as its usages in the methods mentioned.\n\nOverall, the relevant code spans involve the `decompose()` function and its interactions within the `polytope_integrate()` and `main_integrate()` methods to understand the impact of potential changes.",
