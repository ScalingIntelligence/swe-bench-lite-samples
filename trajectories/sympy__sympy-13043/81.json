The issue suggests that the returned list should be sorted or converted to a set, or perhaps the function should retain its dictionary return type and let the caller handle the values. \n\nFrom the provided context and search results, it's evident that the `decompose()` function is utilized in the `polygon_integrate()` and `main_integrate()` functions within the same module. This usage aligns with the issue's concern, as `decompose(polys, separate=True)` is called in `polygon_integrate()`, and the returned monomials are processed without any guarantee of order. This supports the reported problem of arbitrary order leading to test failures.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to address the `decompose()` function's behavior when `separate=True`. This involves either sorting the list of monomials before returning it or changing the function's behavior to maintain a predictable order or to return a set, ensuring uniqueness without order. Given that `decompose()` is a critical function used in mathematical operations within this module, changing its return type or order requires careful consideration to ensure it doesn't disrupt other calculations relying on this function.",
