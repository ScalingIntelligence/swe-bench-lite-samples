The issue suggests that this might be causing test failures after some changes to the core. The relevant part of the code can be found in the `decompose()` function definition, where the behavior of returning a list of values from `poly_dict` is implemented. Since the issue mentions a specific behavior with `separate=True`, it's important to focus on the code span where this parameter is handled. Additionally, the function `polytope_integrate()` uses `decompose()` with `separate=True`, which implies a direct usage related to the issue. By examining these code spans, we can identify the exact location of the problematic behavior and ensure that the returned list is either sorted or returned differently to avoid arbitrary order. This will be crucial for maintaining the integrity of the codebase and preventing future test failures.",
