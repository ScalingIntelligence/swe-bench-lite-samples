The `decompose()` function takes an expression and a boolean `separate`, and it returns a list if `separate` is True. This list is constructed from the values of a dictionary (`poly_dict`), which is inherently unordered in Python prior to version 3.7. The function currently returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which does not ensure any specific order. This matches the behavior described in the issue.
