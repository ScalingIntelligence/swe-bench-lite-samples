I reviewed the entire function to understand how it operates and how it uses the `separate` parameter.\n\n2. I checked where the `decompose()` function is used. It is used within the `polytope_integrate` function to handle the integration process in the context of polytope integration and within the `main_integrate` function to decompose polynomials.\n\n3. By carefully examining the `decompose` function, I identified the specific line causing the arbitrary order issue: `return list(poly_dict.values())`. This line is executed when `separate=True`, which matches the scenario described in the issue.\n\n4.
