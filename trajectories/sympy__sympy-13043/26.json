The function is expected to return a list of monomials that should either be sorted or returned as a set, given that the current implementation, returning `list(poly_dict.values())`, does not ensure order stability and leads to test failures. The provided search results include the `decompose()` function definition in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`. This function correctly handles decomposition based on the `separate` parameter and currently returns an unordered list of monomials. This matches the issue's description regarding the arbitrary order of the returned list. Relevant sections of code are the `decompose()` function itself and its usage within the `polytope_integrate` and `main_integrate` functions, where the order of polynomials matters. Therefore, the identified code spans are those pertaining to the `decompose()` function and its integration within the larger context of the `sympy` module. These are relevant as they directly address the core functionality that is currently causing test failures.",
