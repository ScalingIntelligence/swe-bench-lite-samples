This is important because it affects the subsequent code that relies on the order of the returned list. The relevant code spans are primarily found within the `decompose()` function itself. The function constructs a dictionary `poly_dict` based on the input expression and when `separate=True`, it returns `list(poly_dict.values())`. This operation from dictionary values to list does not guarantee any specific order, hence the issue of arbitrary ordering arises. Additionally, the function `polytope_integrate()` uses the `decompose()` function, and it iterates over the returned list in an order-sensitive manner which could potentially cause issues.

This is causing test failures due to the order not being consistent. The current file context already shows the usage and definition of `decompose()`. New search results confirm that `decompose()` is used in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` within the `polytope_integrate()`, `main_integrate()`, and its own definition. This aligns with the previous context. The `decompose()` function is crucial here, as it is directly responsible for the issue by returning the monomials in an order that's not controlled, leading to inconsistencies. The issue suggests that the list should be sorted or returned as a set, though more analysis is needed to determine the correct approach without breaking other functionalities. The current implementation is relevant and sufficient to understand and address the issue; additional sections found in the new results do not add context relevant to the order of the monomials returned by `decompose()`.
