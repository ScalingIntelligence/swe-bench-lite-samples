This has caused test failures due to the arbitrary order. By examining the provided code, the relevant portion is in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` where two main functions are implicated: `polytope_integrate` and `decompose`. Specifically, within `polytope_integrate`, the function `decompose(polys, separate=True)` is called to process polynomials before integration. This is likely the source of the arbitrary ordering issue since the decomposing function returns the monomials as they are without any sorting. The `decompose` function itself contains the logic to breakdown the polynomials. Thus, the identified code spans are crucial for addressing the issue by either sorting the returned list or ensuring a consistent order.",
