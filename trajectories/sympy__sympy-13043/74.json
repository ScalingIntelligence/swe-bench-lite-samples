The main focus should be on the `decompose()` function within the `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` file. The function should likely return a sorted list or a set if order doesn't matter, but this depends on the intended usage. The current implementation returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is not ordered. Additionally, the function's usage in `polytope_integrate` and `main_integrate` should be reviewed to understand how the output is processed. By understanding these details, corrective actions can be taken, such as sorting the list before returning or adjusting how the output is handled by the calling functions.",

It should be sorted somehow, or returning a set (in which case, why not just use the returned dictionary and have the caller take the values). This is causing test failures for me after some changes to the core. \r\n\r\nCC @ArifAhmed1995 @certik \n"
