This is causing issues with sorting and could be improved by either sorting the list before returning or returning a set if order is not important. Understanding the contexts in which `decompose()` is used will be crucial to identifying all the relevant code. Therefore, the search should focus on the function definition and any other instances where `decompose()` is called or where the output is processed, especially in relation to sorting or ordering.",
