The problem specifically mentions that this function returns a list of monomials that is ordered arbitrarily, which is causing test failures. This suggests that the sorting of the monomials is crucial for the correctness of the output and subsequent operations. Looking at the code, the `decompose()` function, when `separate=True`, returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which implies that the list of monomials is indeed returned without any sorting. This directly aligns with the reported issue. In terms of relevance, the `decompose()` function and its usage within the `polytope_integrate()` function are highly relevant to solving this problem as they directly involve the mentioned behavior. The search results also include other functions and code snippets such as `hyperplane_parameters()`, `clockwise_sort()`, and plotting functions, but they are not as directly relevant to the reported issue concerning the sorting of the output from the `decompose()` function.",

Additionally, the context includes references to other functions such as `clockwise_sort()` which might serve as a model for implementing a sorting mechanism.
