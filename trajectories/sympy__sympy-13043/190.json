This is causing test failures due to the list not being sorted or the intention possibly being to return a set. To address this, I analyzed the `decompose()` function in the provided search results. The function processes expressions to break them into individual polynomial terms stored in a dictionary, then returns the values of this dictionary when `separate=True`. This current implementation indeed returns the terms in arbitrary order, which aligns with the issue described. The analysis also reveals that the `decompose()` function is used in the `polytope_integrate()` and `main_integrate()` functions to handle polynomial decomposition and integration processes. For the purpose of addressing the issue, it's crucial to identify the specific spans of code within these functions that handle the decomposition, particularly where the order of elements is crucial or where arbitrary order might cause problems. Based on the provided code, the relevant file and code spans include the definition of the `decompose()` function and its usage within the `polytope_integrate()` and `main_integrate()` functions. These spans illustrate how the `decompose()` function interacts with other parts of the code and where modifications might need to be made to ensure the returned list is sorted or handled appropriately.",
