Specifically, it mentions that the function, when called with `separate=True`, returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is ordered arbitrarily. This is causing test failures due to the arbitrary order of the returned list, and the user suggests it should be sorted in some way. I've analyzed the provided search results and identified sections of code that are relevant to the `decompose()` function within the `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` and `sympy/polys/polytools.py` files. In `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`, the `decompose()` function is found within the `polytope_integrate` and `main_integrate` functions. Within `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, the `decompose()` function is defined at a module level and is used within the `Poly` class's `decompose` method. These are the relevant code spans that directly relate to solving the problem of addressing the arbitrary order of the list returned by the `decompose()` function.",
