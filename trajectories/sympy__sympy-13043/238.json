The `decompose()` function is used in the `polytope_integrate()` function where, if `max_degree` is not `None`, it decomposes the polynomial expressions and processes each monomial.

The list of monomials is looped through and processed based on their coefficients. In main_integrate, on the other hand, decompose() is used generally to handle the decomposition of expressions without the separate argument being utilized, suggesting it might handle the expression more holistically. However, there's no explicit sorting or ordering applied to the list returned by decompose() with separate=True in the context provided.

Specifically, the function with `separate=True` returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is ordered arbitrarily. To address this, I reviewed the current file context and focused on the `decompose()` function implementation. I analyzed the relevant code spans in the search results. The `decompose()` function is found in two files: `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` and `sympy/solvers/decompogen.py`. In `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`, the function is correctly identified, and it includes the logic for separating the polynomial terms. In `sympy/solvers/decompogen.py`, the function is imported and used but is not the main focus. Other search results are not directly relevant to the issue. Based on this analysis, I have identified the relevant code spans in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`.",

In polytope_integrate, when decompose() is called with separate=True, it appears to be used directly for handling individual monomials in an expression before integration. The list of monomials is looped through and processed based on their coefficients. In main_integrate, on the other hand, decompose() is used generally to handle the decomposition of expressions without the separate argument being utilized, suggesting it might handle the expression more holistically. However, there's no explicit sorting or ordering applied to the list returned by decompose() with separate=True in the context provided. It's crucial to find additional usages of this list and how it is used further in the codebase, especially to identify where a consistent order or explicit sorting might be needed.",

It should be sorted somehow, or returning a set (in which case, why not just use the returned dictionary and have the caller take the values). This is causing test failures for me after some changes to the core. \r\n\r\nCC @ArifAhmed1995 @certik \n"
