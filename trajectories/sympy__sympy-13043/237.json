The issue is that the returned list is ordered arbitrarily, causing test failures after changes to the core. The context provided indicates that the issue is not related to the main functionality of integration but rather the handling of monomials within the `decompose()` function. Given this, the relevant code spans are those sections of the provided search results that deal with the `decompose()` function and its usage. Reviewing the search results, the 'decompose' span directly addresses the function in question, including its logic for handling the `separate` parameter and returning the monomials. The function does indeed return the list directly from `poly_dict.values()`, which is arbitrary by nature unless explicitly sorted.\n\nThere is also a usage of `decompose()` in the 'polytope_integrate' span, which is relevant as it demonstrates a practical application of the function within the integration process. This context helps understand why the ordering of monomials might be important\u2014especially if the order affects how integration results are computed or combined. The main_integrate span does not contain direct usage or definition of decompose(), so it is less relevant despite being nearby in the code file. The identification of these spans is crucial for addressing the reported issue, as the code directly involved in handling and returning monomial parts of a polynomial is fully represented.\n\nBased on this analysis, these two spans are informative enough to understand and potentially rectify the issue with the arbitrary ordering of monomials returned by `decompose()`. The inclusion of code where `decompose()` is used in a real context also aids in understanding its implications within the broader codebase.",
