The issue specifically points out that this arbitrary order is causing test failures after some changes to the core. The task is to identify the relevant code spans from the provided search results and determine if the search task is complete.\n\nReviewing the search results, we can see that both `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` and `sympy/polys/polytools.py` contain `decompose` functions. The relevant sections to focus on are:\n\nIn `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`: The `decompose` function which is the one potentially causing the issue as per the reported issue description.\nIn `sympy/polys/polytools.py`: There is also a `decompose` function, but given the issue's context in `intpoly`, this might not be the direct cause of the issue.\n\nReviewing the `decompose` function in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` shows that when `separate=True`, it directly returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which aligns with the problem described in the reported issue where the order is arbitrary. This is the relevant code span as it directly matches the issue description.\n\nNo other files or spans seem relevant to this specific issue, hence this search task can be concluded as complete.",
