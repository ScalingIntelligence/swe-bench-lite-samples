The relevant parts of the code are within the `polytope_integrate` function where `decompose()` is used to decompose polynomials into monomials, and within the `decompose()` function itself, which handles the decomposition logic. The `polytope_integrate` function uses the output of `decompose()` directly to iterate over monomials for integration, implying that the order of monomials affects the subsequent calculations. The `decompose()` function should be modified to ensure that the list of monomials returned when `separate=True` is sorted or otherwise made consistent. This involves examining the logic within `decompose()` that constructs `poly_dict` and returns its values as a list. Reviewing the entire context and use in `polytope_integrate` confirms that the relevant code spans are indeed those that deal with the decomposition and use of monomials. Thus, the search task can be considered complete after identifying the relevant code spans.",
