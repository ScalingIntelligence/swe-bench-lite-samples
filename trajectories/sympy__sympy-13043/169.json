This arbitrary order is causing test failures after changes to the core. The search results include the `decompose()` function definition, which directly relates to the issue since it handles the behavior of separating and returning monomial terms. Additionally, there are other functions (`polytope_integrate` and `main_integrate`) that call `decompose()` and process its output. These are relevant because they involve usage of the `decompose()` function's output directly. Reviewing the entire context suggests that while the `decompose()` function returns a list, it does not sort or structure it in a specific order. Understanding this context is crucial as it indicates how the output is being used, or potentially misused, leading to the observed side effects. The relevance of these code spans to the reported issue is high as they directly affect the output ordering and thus the tests and any updates to core functionalities. Given the critical role these functions play, they should be carefully considered when addressing the issue.",

The current implementation returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is not guaranteed to be sorted. This causes test failures after changes to the core. To address this, the decompose() function needs to ensure that it either sorts the list before returning it or provides a way for the caller to handle the order of the returned list. The search results contain the relevant code spans of the decompose() function and related functions in the intpoly.py file. Specifically, the decompose() function is found in both the file context and search results, and it directly addresses the issue by returning an unsorted list of monomials when separate=True. Additionally, there are other functions in the search results that could potentially be relevant for implementing a sorting mechanism, such as _sort_gens and _sort_factors in polyutils.py.
