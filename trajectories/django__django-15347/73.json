This leads to 'extra_tags' being converted to None during the deserialization process. The problem seems to be in the MessageEncoder class where the truthiness of 'extra_tags' is checked instead of its direct value. To address this, we need to focus our search on the MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder, and their related methods in the 'django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py' file. Additionally, since the impact spans across standard API functions like messages.debug, messages.info etc., it's crucial to check the 'add_message' function in 'django/contrib/messages/api.py' to ensure consistency in handling 'extra_tags' defaults. Given the provided context, it seems all relevant files have been identified, and we can proceed with specifying these files and functions for further examination.",

  "initial_message": "Messages framework incorrectly serializes/deserializes extra_tags when it's an empty string\nDescription\n\t\nWhen a message is serialised and then deserialised with any of the built in storage backends, then extra_tags==\"\" is converted to extra_tags==None. This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n"
