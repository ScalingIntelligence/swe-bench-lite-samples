The focus is on the ExpressionWrapper class within 'django/db/models/expressions.py' and the Q class within 'django/db/models/query_utils.py'. Reviewing the code, it appears that the ExpressionWrapper class is involved in wrapping expressions for database annotation, and the Q class handles the construction of query expressions. The provided spans include critical methods such as '__init__' in ExpressionWrapper, which initializes the wrapper with an expression and an output field. It also includes methods in the Q class such as '__invert__', which handles the negation of Q objects. These methods appear relevant to addressing the issue of handling negated Q objects within ExpressionWrapper. Additional relevant methods involve the Query class within 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', which is responsible for managing and constructing SQL queries. This class includes methods like 'rewrite_cols', 'add_annotation', 'resolve_expression', and 'build_filter'. These methods are pertinent as they manage and compile different parts of SQL queries that are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue at hand.

In the provided search results, we see the class `ExpressionWrapper` defined in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, which includes methods such as `__init__`, `set_source_expressions`, and `get_source_expressions`. This class is used to wrap an expression with a different output field, which is directly relevant to the reported issue. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is also inspected, as it contains methods like `add_annotation`, `resolve_expression`, and `build_filter` that could be involved in handling the `Q` objects and their negations within a query.
