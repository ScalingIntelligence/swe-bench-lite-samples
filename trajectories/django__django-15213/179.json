Specifically, ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[])) works as expected, but ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[])) causes the query to break. The problem likely lies in how the negation operator (~) interacts with the ExpressionWrapper and Q objects. We need to investigate the implementation of ExpressionWrapper, Q, and related classes such as Query, SQLCompiler, and WhereNode to understand how the negation is handled and why it fails in this specific case.",

This includes how it processes and compiles expressions, which is crucial for understanding the behavior with the negation operator (~) applied to Q objects.\n\nFrom 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', the Q class and its methods, such as __init__, _combine, __or__, __and__, __invert__, and resolve_expression, were analyzed as these methods define the behavior of Q objects, including how they combine and negate. The __invert__ method, in particular, is of interest as it deals directly with the negation of Q objects, aligning with the issue's symptoms.\n\nThe analysis of these code spans shows that they contain the necessary logic to understand how ExpressionWrapper handles expressions and specifically how it reacts to negated Q objects. The issue at hand likely stems from how ExpressionWrapper compiles or processes the negated Q object compared to a non-negated one.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans in both files are directly relevant to the reported issue, providing insight into the mechanics and potential points of failure when dealing with negated Q objects within an ExpressionWrapper.",
