The user observes that while ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[])) works, ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[])) causes the query to break. The symptoms show a difference in behavior between these two cases. The search results provide relevant code spans from django/db/models/query_utils.py. Specifically, the Q class definition, the __init__ method, the __invert__ method, and the resolve_expression method are all pertinent to the issue. These methods are critical as they handle the construction and manipulation of Q objects, especially the negation (__invert__) which directly relates to the issue at hand. The user's issue likely stems from how the negation is handled in the Q object and how this affects the ExpressionWrapper. Given these code spans, it's apparent that the search results are highly relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the reported issue.",

Therefore, while the Q class __invert__ method provides insight into the negation logic, there is a need for further file context to understand the behavior of ExpressionWrapper.

I examined the current file context and the new search results to see if they are relevant to this issue. The current file context shows the `Q` class and its methods, which is essential for understanding the negation behavior (`~Q`). In the search results, I found the `ExpressionWrapper` class and its methods, including `__init__`, `set_source_expressions`, `get_source_expressions`, `as_sql`, and `__repr__`. These methods are directly related to how the `ExpressionWrapper` handles expressions and could be implicated in the issue, particularly how it handles the negation of `Q` objects. The issue's detailed description suggests that the problem might be with the way `ExpressionWrapper` processes negated `Q` objects, leading to a broken query for `~Q(pk__in=[])` but not for `Q(pk__in=[])`. Given this, I have identified the spans in `django/db/models/expressions.py` that deal with the `ExpressionWrapper` as relevant to the reported issue.",
