The issue specifically occurs with ~Q(pk__in=[]), causing a crash while it works fine with Q(pk__in=[]).\n\nNext, I examine the current file context and see there are no relevant files identified yet. This means I need to start from the search results provided.\n\nIn the search results from `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, we see several code spans within the `Q` class. These spans include `__init__`, which handles initialization of the `Q` object, `__invert__` which implements the negation operation (~Q), and `resolve_expression`, which resolves the expression for the Q object. The `__invert__` method is particularly relevant as it directly relates to the negation operation reported in the issue.\n\nAccording to the issue, when using `~Q(pk__in=[])`, it seems the ExpressionWrapper fails to handle the negation properly, potentially pointing to issues or missing handling conditions in the `__invert__` or the `resolve_expression` methods.\n\nIn `django/db/models/expressions.py`, there's a key class, `ExpressionWrapper`, which is directly mentioned in the reported issue. Spans like `__init__` that initializes the ExpressionWrapper with an expression and output field, and `as_sql` which formats the expression to SQL are critical as they determine how data is processed and represented in the database operations.\n\nWith these areas considered, it's clear that the logical negation process within the `Q` class and the handling of the ExpressionWrapper are central to resolving the reported issue. Therefore, the identified spans seem relevant and offer a clear path for further debugging or modifications.",
