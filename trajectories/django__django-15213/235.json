The symptom described is that while ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[])) works fine, ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[])) causes the query to break. This suggests that the issue might be related to how ExpressionWrapper handles the negation of Q objects. The relevant code spans identified in the search results include the initialization of ExpressionWrapper and the handling of its expression property. Additionally, the build_filter method in the Query class is relevant as it deals with the construction of filters, which is central to the problem at hand. The __invert__ method in the Q class is also crucial as it defines the behavior of the negation operator (~). Finally, the resolve_expression method in both the Q and Query classes is significant as it is involved in resolving and processing expressions, including those that involve Q objects.",
