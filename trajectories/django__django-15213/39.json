The symptoms indicate that `ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]), output_field=BooleanField())` works as expected, producing a query with `SELECT 0 AS \"foo\" FROM \"table\"`. However, `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]), output_field=BooleanField())` fails to produce a correct SQL query. Based on this, the focus should be on understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of the `Q` class and its negation (`~Q`) within the `ExpressionWrapper`. The search results include crucial parts of the `Q` class, such as the `__invert__` method which is directly related to negating a `Q` object. Additionally, the `resolve_expression` method is important as it resolves the `Q` object into an SQL clause, which is where the problem might manifest. These code spans are directly relevant to the issue at hand.",
