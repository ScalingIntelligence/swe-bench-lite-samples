The search results provide a comprehensive overview of how Django handles expressions, particularly focusing on the ExpressionWrapper class and the Q class. The ExpressionWrapper class is responsible for wrapping expressions to ensure they return a specific output field. The Q class is used for constructing complex query filters. The issue seems to arise specifically when negating a Q object within an ExpressionWrapper. Relevant code spans include the initialization of ExpressionWrapper and Q, their resolve_expression methods, and as_sql methods. These methods are crucial for understanding how expressions are compiled into SQL and how they interact with query sets. Given that the issue involves negating a Q object, special attention is paid to the Q class's __invert__ method. The search results cover essential areas, including the creation and manipulation of expressions, their compilation into SQL, and the handling of negated Q objects. The presence of such detailed code spans makes it feasible to understand and potentially resolve the issue. The identified code spans include the initialization methods of ExpressionWrapper and Q, their resolution methods, and the SQL compilation methods. These spans are directly relevant to the problem as they involve the core functionalities involved in the reported issue.",
