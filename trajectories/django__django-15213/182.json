The `Q` class spans, especially the `__invert__` method, which handles negation (~Q).\n2. The `Query` class spans, particularly the `resolve_expression` method, which is crucial for expression resolution and handling annotations.\n3. The `Query.build_filter` method, which constructs filters and is likely where the handling of negated conditions occurs.\n\nThese spans align with the issue's requirement to understand how negation is handled in Q objects and how expressions are resolved in queries. Further analysis and possibly additional search results may be needed to fully understand and resolve the issue, especially regarding the specific handling of empty lists within these methods.",
