The symptoms indicate that while `ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]))` works as expected, `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))` causes the query to break. This suggests a potential bug or inconsistent handling of negated `Q` objects within the `ExpressionWrapper`. The provided search results include key parts of the `Q` class and the `ExpressionWrapper` class in Django's codebase. These include the `Q.__init__`, `Q.__invert__`, and `Q.resolve_expression` methods, which handle the initialization, negation, and resolution of `Q` objects. Additionally, the `ExpressionWrapper.__init__` and `ExpressionWrapper.as_sql` methods are relevant, as they define how `ExpressionWrapper` instances are initialized and compiled into SQL. Understanding these methods and how they interact is crucial for identifying the root cause of the issue.
