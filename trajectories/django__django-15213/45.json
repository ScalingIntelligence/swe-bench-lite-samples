These methods help us understand how Q objects are initialized and how their negation (__invert__) is handled. The search results provide the implementation of Q.__invert__, which is essential for understanding the negation of a Q object. \n\nNext, we look into the ExpressionWrapper class and its relevant methods: __init__, set_source_expressions, and as_sql. These methods help us understand how ExpressionWrapper instances are initialized and how SQL is generated for them. The search results provide the implementation of ExpressionWrapper.as_sql, which is crucial for understanding how the SQL for the ExpressionWrapper is compiled. \n\nThe provided context does not explicitly demonstrate how the negation of Q with an empty list is handled within the ExpressionWrapper. However, the search results significantly contribute to understanding the mechanism of both Q and ExpressionWrapper, which can be leveraged to resolve the reported issue. Thus, the identified code spans are relevant to further investigating and resolving the issue described. \n\nBased on the analysis, the search results are relevant to the reported issue, and the identified code spans provide a valuable context for understanding and potentially resolving it.",

Specifically, the Q class in query_utils.py contains the __invert__ method, which is likely involved in handling the negation of Q objects. This is relevant because the issue describes a problem when negating Q objects with 'pk__in=[]' conditions. Additionally, the ExpressionWrapper class in expressions.py is involved in wrapping expressions, and its as_sql method is crucial for SQL query construction, which aligns with the observed symptoms in the issue (the query breaks when negating Q objects). Furthermore, the Window class in expressions.py might also be relevant if it interacts with ExpressionWrapper.
