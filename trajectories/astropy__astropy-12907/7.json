The example provided demonstrates that the separability matrix is not computed correctly when these models are nested. To address this, it is crucial to identify the relevant parts of the codebase involved in the computation of separability, handling of compound models, and possibly the recursive structure evaluation. From the provided search results, several spans are potentially relevant: 'CompoundModel.__init__', 'CompoundModel.n_submodels', 'CompoundModel.submodel_names', and 'CompoundModel.inverse'. These spans involve initialization, submodel management, and the inverse properties of compound models, all of which might impact the separability matrix computation. However, a more detailed inspection of the 'CompoundModel' class and its methods is necessary to pinpoint exactly where the issue could arise, especially with regard to how nested models are processed and evaluated for separability. Detailed review of these spans might reveal the necessary conditions or operations that are not adequately addressed or tested in the current implementation.",
