The key functions to inspect are `separability_matrix`, `_separable`, `_coord_matrix`, `_cstack`, `_cdot`, and `_compute_n_outputs`. These functions are responsible for determining the separability of models, especially when dealing with nested models. The `separability_matrix` function calls `_separable`, which in turn uses `_cstack` and `_cdot` to handle the combination of models. The issue seems to arise when the separability of nested models is evaluated, particularly in how `_cstack` and `_cdot` handle the combination of coordinate matrices. The provided code spans cover the core logic for handling separability and should be analyzed to determine if they correctly handle nested models as reported in the issue.",
