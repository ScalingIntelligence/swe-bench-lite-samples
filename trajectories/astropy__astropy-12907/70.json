The issue specifically addresses the unexpected behavior when nesting compound models, leading to non-separable outputs for nested models that should be separable. Upon analyzing the provided search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are found in the CompoundModel class within the astropy/modeling/core.py file and the separability_matrix function in the astropy/modeling/separable.py file. These code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue with nested compound models. The CompoundModel class contains the core logic for handling compound models, including their initialization, replacement, and setting of sub-models and parameter units. The separability_matrix function is responsible for computing the separability matrix, which is directly linked to the issue described. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

Specifically, the separability matrix is expected to be diagonal when dealing with nested compound models, but the actual output shows unexpected shared states between outputs and inputs when such models are nested. To address this, we need to look at the separability matrix and how it is computed. The existing code spans show that the separability matrix is generated from the `_separable` function, which does a 'postorder' traversal of the model tree to calculate separability. The `CompoundModel` class and its methods show how models are combined and how they interact, specifically with the `_separable` function. The new code spans in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` also provide additional insight into how separability is checked (`is_separable`), and how separability of nested models is computed (`_separable`, `_cstack`). Additionally, the `CompoundModel` class's methods involved in restructuring and computing with submodels are explored in `astropy/modeling/core.py`. From an analysis of these code spans, it appears that the computation of separability involving nested models might not be fully capturing the separation as expected, which could be due to how the structure of the compound model is traversed and computed. For further investigation, the `_separable` function's handling of operations in the model ('&', '|') should be specifically looked at in relation to how it manages or alters the `separable_matrix`.",

The current implementation does not correctly handle the separability for nested CompoundModels, leading to incorrect results. To address this, we need to recursively check the separability of each submodel and correctly combine them in the separability matrix.\n\nI've identified that the function `_separable` and the `CompoundModel` class methods are likely places where updates would be most effective to resolve the issue. I will start by updating the `_separable` function to handle the recursive separability checks for nested CompoundModels.\n\nThe first change I propose will affect the `_separable` function, where I will ensure that the separability matrix is correctly computed for nested models, considering the operations involved.",
