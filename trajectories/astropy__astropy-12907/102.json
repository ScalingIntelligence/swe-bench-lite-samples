            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue describes an issue with the `separability_matrix` function in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module when dealing with nested CompoundModels. The key problem is that when a CompoundModel is nested, the separability matrix does not compute correctly, indicating that inputs and outputs are not separable when they should be.\n\nThe current context does not identify any previously relevant code. Therefore, the new search results from the `astropy/modeling/core.py` and `astropy/modeling/separable.py` files need to be analyzed.\n\nIn `astropy/modeling/core.py`, the `CompoundModel` class and its methods are analyzed. The `__init__` method for `CompoundModel` is particularly relevant as it defines how compound models are created, including how their inputs and outputs are combined and the constraints on these combinations. The `replace_submodel` method also appears relevant as it deals with substituting components within a compound model, which could be related to how separability is affected by nesting.\n\nIn `astropy/modeling/separable.py`, the `separability_matrix` function is found. This function directly relates to the issue reported, as it computes the separability matrix for a given transform. The fact that the function uses the `_separable` helper function to determine separability suggests that the underlying logic of how separability is checked might be incorrect or incomplete for nested CompoundModels.\n\nBased on this analysis, several code spans in both files appear highly relevant to the reported issue concerning the separability of nested CompoundModels.",

  "initial_message": "Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels\nConsider the following model:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom astropy.modeling import models as m\r\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\r\n\r\ncm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> separability_matrix(cm)\r\narray([[ True, False],\r\n       [False,  True]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I make the model more complex:\r\n```python\r\n>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))\r\narray([[ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [False, False,  True, False],\r\n       [False, False, False,  True]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.\r\n\r\nIf however, I nest these compound models:\r\n```python\r\n>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)\r\narray([[ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [False, False,  True,  True],\r\n       [False, False,  True,  True]])\r\n```\r\nSuddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?\r\n\r\nThis feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?\n"
