The user provides examples demonstrating that the separability matrix behaves unexpectedly when CompoundModels are nested. The key components to look for in the code are the definitions and implementations of the `separability_matrix` function and the `_separable` function, which are responsible for determining the separability of model components. Additionally, the `CompoundModel` class and its methods are relevant since they handle the combination of models and could potentially affect the separability computation. By closely examining the provided spans, we can identify which parts of the code are involved in the separability matrix calculation and how they handle nested models. This analysis will help in determining whether the reported issue is a bug or if there's a misunderstanding in the expected behavior.",

Specifically, the problem arises when nesting models using the '&' operator, which seems to lead to non-separable outputs unexpectedly. To address this issue, we need to examine the relevant code spans that handle the separability matrix computation and compound model operations.\n\nThe initial analysis of the provided code spans indicates that the separability matrix computation is primarily handled by the '_separable' function in the 'astropy/modeling/separable.py' file. This function recursively computes the separability matrix for both the left and right components of a CompoundModel and then combines them based on the operator. The '_coord_matrix' function is also crucial as it computes the coordinate matrix for individual models, which is then used in the separability matrix computation.\n\nIn the 'astropy/modeling/core.py' file, the CompoundModel class is defined, which includes the '__init__' method for initializing the compound model, handling different operators, and managing the inputs, outputs, and parameters of the compound model.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the focus should be on how the separability matrix is computed for nested compound models, particularly when the '&' operator is used. The current implementation of _separable should be analyzed to see if it correctly handles the combination of separability matrices when nesting models.\n\nThe provided search results confirm the presence of the relevant code spans. The '_compute_n_outputs', '_cstack', '_cdot', and '_separable' functions in the 'astropy/modeling/separable.py' file are directly related to the separability matrix computation. Additionally, the CompoundModel class and its methods in the 'astropy/modeling/core.py' file are essential for understanding how compound models are created and managed.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.

Additionally, the CompoundModel class and its methods that handle the combination of models and their properties should be reviewed for any inconsistencies or bugs related to the separability property. The provided search results include both 'separable.py' and 'core.py' files, which contain the necessary code spans for 'is_separable', 'separability_matrix', '_separable', '_coord_matrix', and the CompoundModel class.

The `separability_matrix` function uses the `_separable` function, which in turn references `_calculate_separability_matrix` in the context of `CompoundModel`. The `_calculate_separability_matrix` method isn't fully provided, but it's clear that the `_separable` function is designed to handle both single models and compound models, recursively calling itself for compound models. This recursive handling might be where the issue lies when dealing with nested compound models.
