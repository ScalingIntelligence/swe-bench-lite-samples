The 'Model' class provides the foundational structure for all models, including initialization and evaluation methods. The 'CompoundModel' class extends this to handle operations between models, including initialization and evaluation tailored for operations like '&' and '|'. The 'separability_matrix' function is located in the 'astropy.modeling.separable' module and is the central function to investigate for correct separability handling.
