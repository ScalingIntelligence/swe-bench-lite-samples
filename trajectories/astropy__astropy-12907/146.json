The issue specifically points out problems with nested models, so we need to ensure that the code handling CompoundModel operations and separability computation is examined. We start by identifying the `separability_matrix` function and its helper function `_separable`. Both of these functions are located in the `separable.py` file. The `separability_matrix` function initializes the process of determining separability and calls `_separable` to handle the actual computation. The `_separable` function contains logic to handle both single models and compound models. For compound models, it recursively processes the left and right parts of the model using the `_separable` function again. This recursion is crucial for handling nested models. Additionally, we need to examine the `CompoundModel` class in the `core.py` file, as it defines the structure and behavior of compound models, which are central to the reported issue. Understanding how compound models are initialized, manipulated, and accessed is key to identifying the root of the separability computation problem. The `CompoundModel` class contains methods and properties for managing submodels, parameters, and operations. The `__init__` method is particularly important as it sets up the compound model's structure and operations based on the provided left and right models. By examining these areas, we can pinpoint whether the issue lies within the recursive handling of separability checks, the structure of compound models, or some other aspect of compound model management.",
