The issue appears to be that when CompoundModels are nested, the separability matrix does not compute as expected, suggesting a possible bug in the implementation. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the creation of CompoundModels, the initialization of these models, and the computation of the separability matrix. \n\nFrom the search results, several key sections of code are relevant:\n\n1. The 'Model' class definition and its attributes are fundamental to understanding how models are defined and managed within the modeling module.\n2. The 'CompoundModel' class is central to the issue, as it deals with the combination of models using operators like '&', '|', etc. The '__init__' method of 'CompoundModel' is particularly relevant as it handles the combination logic and input/output specifications.\n3. The 'replace_submodel' method within 'CompoundModel' deals with replacing submodels within a compound model, which could potentially relate to how nested models are managed.\n4. The 'fix_inputs' function is used to fix specific inputs within a model, and could be related to how inputs are handled in nested models.\n5. The 'separability_matrix' function in 'separable.py' is directly implicated in the reported issue, as it computes the separability matrix for models. This function should be examined closely to understand its logic and how it might interact with nested CompoundModels.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified spans of code from 'core.py' and 'separable.py' are relevant to the reported issue and should be further analyzed to determine the cause of the unexpected behavior in the separability matrix for nested CompoundModels.",
