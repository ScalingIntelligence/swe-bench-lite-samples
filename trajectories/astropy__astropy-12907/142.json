The issue demonstrates that while the separability matrix is computed correctly for simple compound models, it fails to compute correctly when models are nested. This discrepancy suggests that the `_separable` function, which is responsible for determining the separability of model outputs, may not be handling nested compound models appropriately. From the provided code context and search results, we can identify the relevant code spans that are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing this issue. The `_separable` function and the related logic within `CompoundModel` initialization and manipulation are of particular interest. Additionally, the `separability_matrix` function under `separable.py` is a key entry point for understanding the separability computation. The `CompoundModel` class in `core.py` and its methods for handling submodel replacement and initialization are essential for understanding how compound models are constructed and manipulated, which could affect separability calculations. The `_separable` function's handling of `CompoundModel` instances and its recursive calls suggest where the computation might be failing for nested models. Therefore, these sections of the codebase are relevant to addressing the issue of incorrect separability matrix computation for nested compound models.",

This involves understanding the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function and the `_separable` function in the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file, as well as the `CompoundModel` class in the `astropy/modeling/core.py` file. Given the current context and search results, it appears necessary to focus on the parts of the code that handle the separability matrix computation and the composition of compound models. The initial file context already provided key sections related to these functionalities, and the new search results confirm the relevance of the `CompoundModel` class and its methods, particularly those involved in the initialization and composition of models. Therefore, the identified spans directly contribute to the understanding and potential resolution of the reported issue regarding the separability matrix for nested CompoundModels.",

Notably, the `CompoundModel` class's initializer directly handles various operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `&`, `|`, and `fix_inputs`, which are crucial for understanding how compound models are created and managed. Also, the `_separable` function and `separability_matrix` are key for determining model separability, with `_separable` evaluating separability based on model type or recursively for compound models. Despite more context, there's still a gap in understanding how nested compound models are specifically handled in the `_separable` function and how this might interact with bounding boxes or inputs. The search should expand beyond just these directly highlighted components to ensure all pathways affecting separability are examined.",
