The issue describes expected and unexpected behavior of the separability matrix when dealing with various model combinations. The search results provided include code spans from `astropy/modeling/core.py` and `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. In `core.py`, relevant code spans include the `CompoundModel` class and its methods `__init__`, `replace_submodel`, and `_set_sub_models_and_parameter_units`. These spans define the behavior of CompoundModel and how it handles operations such as merging, piping, and fixing inputs. In `separable.py`, the `separability_matrix` function calculates the separability matrix based on the transform provided. Considering the issue, these spans are relevant because they handle the construction and manipulation of models (particularly CompoundModels) and the calculation of separability which directly relates to the issue at hand. However, the provided spans do not include the actual bug or the specific logic that leads to the incorrect separability calculation in nested CompoundModels. Further investigation into the `_separable` function mentioned in `separability_matrix` and its interaction with `CompoundModel` operations is necessary to identify and potentially fix the bug.",

The key parts of the issue are: 1. The separability matrix should be diagonal for simple compound models. 2. The separability matrix computation fails for nested compound models. Given the context and the issue, it's crucial to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the separability matrix computation and the handling of `CompoundModel` instances, especially focusing on the `_separable` function and its interactions with the `CompoundModel` class. The provided search results include multiple code spans in the `astropy.modeling.separable` and `astropy.modeling.core` modules that are relevant to these tasks. Specifically, the `_separable` function and its associated helper functions (`_operators`, `_cstack`, `_cdot`, and `_coord_matrix`) are critical for understanding how separability is computed. Additionally, the `CompoundModel` class and its methods, such as `_calculate_separability_matrix`, `_get_left_inputs_from_args`, `_get_right_inputs_from_args`, and others, are also relevant as they provide the structure and logic for handling compound models. The identified code spans will help in pinpointing the exact locations where the separability matrix computation might be failing for nested models, leading to the reported issue.",
