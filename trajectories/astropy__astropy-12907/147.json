This involves a detailed inspection of the `CompoundModel` class and its interactions with the `separability_matrix` function. Based on the provided search results, the relevant code spans are located in two main files: 'astropy/modeling/core.py' and 'astropy/modeling/separable.py'. \n\nIn 'astropy/modeling/core.py', the 'Model' and 'CompoundModel' classes are defined, with the latter being particularly relevant due to its role in handling complex models and nesting. The '__init__' method in the 'CompoundModel' class is crucial as it initializes these models and ensures operations between them are valid. Additionally, the 'replace_submodel' method is likely related to modifying or replacing parts of the model, potentially relevant for debugging or adjusting nested models.\n\nIn 'astropy/modeling/separable.py', the 'separability_matrix' function is directly related to the issue at hand. This function checks the separability of a transform. The '_coord_matrix' and '_separable' functions are also relevant as they support the computation of separability, potentially addressing how these matrices are created and manipulated for various types of models.\n\nThese code spans seem relevant as they cover both the core functionality of handling model composition (in 'core.py') and the specific separability computations (in 'separable.py'). These areas are directly connected to the reported issues with separability in nested models.",
