There is no current file context provided, indicating that this is the first step in identifying relevant code spans.\n\n3. The search results include several code spans from `astropy/modeling/core.py` and `astropy/modeling/separable.py`:\n   - In `astropy/modeling/core.py`, there are definitions for `Model`, `FittableModel`, and `CompoundModel`. The `CompoundModel` class is particularly relevant as it involves nested models and might be where the issue lies.\n   - The `CompoundModel.__init__` method deals with initializing the model and handling different operators, which could be related to the separability issues.\n   - There is also a `replace_submodel` method in `CompoundModel` which might be relevant for testing or debugging nested models.\n   - In `astropy/modeling/separable.py`, the `is_separable` and `separability_matrix` functions are defined. These are directly related to the reported issue as they compute the separability matrix and determine if outputs are separable from inputs.\n\n4. Relevant code spans include: `CompoundModel.__init__`, `CompoundModel.replace_submodel`, and `separability_matrix`. These spans cover the initialization of CompoundModels, operations on nested models, and the computation of separability matrices.\n\n5. The search task is not yet complete as only partial context is provided for the `astropy/modeling/core.py`.

The `CompoundModel` class defines the structure for compound models, including handling for various operators such as '&' for concatenating models. The `_separable` function is designed to determine the separability of a model's outputs with respect to its inputs. It does this by checking if the model has a precomputed separability matrix or recursively evaluating the separability of its components if it's a `CompoundModel`. The issue likely arises from how the separability matrix is computed for nested `CompoundModel` instances, especially in the handling of the '&' operator where inputs and outputs are concatenated, leading to potential misalignment in the evaluation of separability across these concatenated models.

The analysis of the search results reveals the following key points:\n1. The `CompoundModel` class and its methods (`__init__`, `replace_submodel`, `_set_sub_models_and_parameter_units`) provide insights into how compound models are initialized, modified, and their parameters managed.\n2. The `fix_inputs` function helps in understanding how model inputs can be fixed and how bounding boxes are managed in such scenarios.\n3. The `separability_matrix` and `_separable` functions in the `separable.py` file are crucial as they are directly related to the computation of separability matrices.\n4. The `_separable` function handles the computation of separability for both `CompoundModel` instances and regular `Model` instances. It uses a recursive approach to handle `CompoundModel` instances by combining the separability matrices of the left and right components based on the operator.\n\nBased on these findings, the relevant code spans are identified as follows:",

It does this by checking if the model has a precomputed separability matrix or recursively evaluating the separability of its components if it's a `CompoundModel`. The issue likely arises from how the separability matrix is computed for nested `CompoundModel` instances, especially in the handling of the '&' operator where inputs and outputs are concatenated, leading to potential misalignment in the evaluation of separability across these concatenated models.

The current implementation recursively checks separability for both left and right components and applies the operator to their separate matrices, but it might not sufficiently adjust based on the nested structuring of models.
