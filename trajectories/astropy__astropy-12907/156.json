The separability matrix is expected to be diagonal, indicating that outputs are separable from inputs. However, in the case of nested CompoundModels, the separability matrix deviates from the expected diagonal form. This suggests a potential bug in the function's handling of nested models. To investigate this, we should focus our search on the separable.py file where the separability_matrix function is defined, as well as the core.py file which contains the CompoundModel class. These two files are likely where the issue resides.",
