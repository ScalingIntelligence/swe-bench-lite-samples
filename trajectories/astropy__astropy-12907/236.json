The expected behavior is that nested models should maintain their separability, but the current implementation seems to produce incorrect results for certain nested configurations. The search should focus on the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file, where the `separability_matrix` function is defined, and also consider the `astropy/modeling/core.py` file as it contains the `CompoundModel` class definition, which is likely involved in the nesting mechanism.",

The code in 'astropy/modeling/separable.py' contains the definitions for 'is_separable', 'separability_matrix', a set of helper functions including '_compute_n_outputs', '_arith_oper', '_coord_matrix', '_cstack', '_cdot', and '_separable'. These functions collectively handle the computation and functionality related to separability matrices and deal with model combinations using operators such as '&', '|', '+', '-', '*', '/', and '**'. Thus, this file contains the core logic for handling separability in compound models and is directly relevant to the issue reported. The 'astropy/modeling/core.py' file, specifically the 'CompoundModel' class and its associated methods, provides the structure and operations for combining models, which includes nested combinations. Therefore, understanding and possibly modifying these elements would contribute to addressing the separability issue with nested compound models. Based on the reported issue and the functionality described in the search results, it is clear that both sets of code spans are relevant to the problem at hand and should be considered in the solution.",
