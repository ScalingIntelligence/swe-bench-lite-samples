The separability matrix is supposed to indicate whether the outputs of a model are separable (independent) from each other. The problem arises when nesting compound models, where the separability matrix does not seem to compute correctly, potentially indicating a bug. Given the context and the provided code snippets, it looks like the relevant code might be located in the `separable.py` and `core.py` files within the Astropy modeling module. The `separability_matrix` function and related utility functions should be checked to ensure they handle nested compound models correctly.",
