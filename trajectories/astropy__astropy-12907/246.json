The user demonstrates that simple compound models compute separability correctly, but nested ones do not. The search results include several key functions and helper functions related to separability matrix calculation. 'is_separable' and 'separability_matrix' are the main functions. '_compute_n_outputs', '_arith_oper', '_coord_matrix', '_cstack', '_cdot', and '_separable' are helper functions that support the computation logic. The '_separable' function is particularly important as it recursively processes the separability for CompoundModels. The issue suggests that deeper analysis is needed within the '_separable' function and its handling of nested CompoundModels. Additionally, the '_operators' dictionary maps the CompoundModel operations to the corresponding helper functions, which are vital for understanding how the separability matrix is manipulated based on the operation. All these functions and the '_operators' dictionary are directly relevant to the reported issue concerning the separability matrix calculation for nested CompoundModels.",

To address this, I focused on the relevant parts of the codebase related to the computation of separability in the modeling module. The key functions are `separability_matrix`, `_separable`, and `_coord_matrix`. These functions are responsible for determining the separability of the models and their inputs and outputs. The `separability_matrix` function calls `_separable`, which in turn uses `_coord_matrix` to generate a matrix indicating separability. The issue seems to arise in the handling of nested CompoundModels, which is done in the `_separable` function. By examining these functions, we can identify the relevant code spans that might need to be adjusted or further investigated to fix the separability computation for nested models. Additionally, the CompoundModel class and its methods are relevant as they define how models are combined and evaluated, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of nested models.",

The provided search results significantly aid in this analysis by including the key functions and methods involved in the separability matrix computation. I will focus on the spans that contain the functions `is_separable`, `separability_matrix`, `_separable`, and `_coord_matrix` from `astropy/modeling/separable.py`, as well as the `CompoundModel` class and its initialization method from `astropy/modeling/core.py`.
