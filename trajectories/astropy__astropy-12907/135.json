The 'separability_matrix' function initializes the separability matrix and uses the '_separable' function to determine separability. The '_separable' function, especially, is crucial for handling nested transformations, which is where the issue lies. Given that the '_separable' function is responsible for calculating separability for compound models and this is exactly where the reported issue is stemming from, it is evident that both 'separability_matrix' and '_separable' are highly relevant to the issue at hand. The '_separable' function's recursive logic to handle nested compound models is particularly pertinent to addressing the issue.

Specifically, it points out that while simple and slightly more complex compound models compute separability correctly, nested compound models do not. I will analyze the provided code to identify which parts are responsible for handling separability and how they are treating nested compound models. The code includes several functions that seem to be relevant: `is_separable`, `separability_matrix`, `_coord_matrix`, and `_separable`. These functions seem to be the backbone of the separability computation in the module. I will focus on the `_separable` function, which handles the core logic of computing separability, especially how it deals with compound models. The issue might be related to how separability is calculated when there are nested compound models, as the problematic behavior seems to arise in such cases. The `_separable` function mainly relies on calling itself recursively for each component of a compound model, but it seems to omit special handling for nested structures, which might be the cause of the issue.

The user describes how the separability matrix behaves as expected with simple compound models but incorrectly when nested. The relevant code spans provided in the context include functions for computing separability (`is_separable`, `separability_matrix`, `_separable`), and helper functions (`_coord_matrix`, `_cstack`, `_cdot`) that contribute to this computation. The new search results include an additional helper function `_compute_n_outputs` which calculates the number of outputs between two models, which could be a necessary piece for the separability computation when handling compound and nested models. Identifying these functions and the logic within them is important to understand how the separability computation might be failing specifically with nested models and to suggest potential fixes or further investigation.",

For compound models, it recursively calculates the separability for the left and right components and combines them using the `_operators` dictionary, which defines how separability should be combined for different operators. The issue might be rooted in how the separability matrices for nested compound models are combined. Specifically, it's important to ensure that the combination methods (_cstack and _cdot) correctly handle the nested structures and preserve the correct separability properties. An in-depth examination of these functions would help in identifying the missing or incorrect combination logic.",
