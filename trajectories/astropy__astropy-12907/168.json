The issue points out that while the separability matrix is correctly computed for simple `CompoundModel` instances, it does not handle nested `CompoundModel` instances correctly. The relevant code spans identified include functions and classes directly related to separability calculations and `CompoundModel` handling. Specifically, the functions `is_separable`, `separability_matrix`, `_coord_matrix`, and `_separable` from `astropy/modeling/separable.py` are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the separability computation. Additionally, the class `CompoundModel` and its methods from `astropy/modeling/core.py` provide essential context and implementation details on how compound models are constructed and manipulated. These functions and class methods are analyzed to identify where the separability calculation might be failing for nested models. Furthermore, the `ModelBoundingBox` and `CompoundBoundingBox` classes from `astropy/modeling/bounding_box.py`, particularly their `fix_inputs` methods, are relevant as they handle input transformations which might also interact with separability calculations in complex model compositions.",

Additionally, the CompoundModel class and its methods in core.py are relevant as they define the behavior of compound models, which are crucial for understanding the separability issue with nested models. The bounding_box related classes in bounding_box.py are also indirectly relevant as they might interact with the models in ways that could affect separability, though the direct concern for separability lies within separable.py.
