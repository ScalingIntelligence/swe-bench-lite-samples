The reported issue identifies a discrepancy in the separability matrix when models are nested, suggesting that the separability check might not be properly propagated or computed through nested structures. From the provided code spans, it appears that the `CompoundModel` class and its methods handle the composition of models and the evaluation of their operations. The `separability_matrix` function in `separable.py` computes the matrix using the `_separable` function, which in turn handles the logic for both `CompoundModel` and `Model`. The existing implementation for `_separable` handles the computation of separability for simple models and combines results for compound models using provided operators. To address the issue, it seems that the logic for handling separability in nested compound models might need to be adjusted to ensure that the separability properties are properly propagated through these nested models. Specifically, the `_separable` function and the handling of operators in `CompoundModel` might need further inspection or adjustments to correctly account for nested structures. Reviewing relevant code spans in both `core.py` and `separable.py` indicates that while the code constructs compound models and assesses their separability, there might be an oversight or bug in how separability is determined recursively or through nested models. Hence, further inspection of `CompoundModel` class methods, especially `_separable`, and how it handles the `left` and `right` components could provide insights on how to fix the reported issue.",
