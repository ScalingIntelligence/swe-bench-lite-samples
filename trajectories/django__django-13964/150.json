This issue can lead to data loss and inappropriately deferred foreign key constraints until the transaction commits.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the key problem areas to focus on in the code are the handling of foreign keys and the saving mechanism for related objects. The search results provide relevant code spans that touch on these areas:\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py** contains the `Model` class definition and its methods for initializing (`__init__`), saving (`_save_parents`, `save_base`), and preparing related fields for save (`_prepare_related_fields_for_save`). These methods are crucial for understanding how Django handles model instantiation, saving, and the synchronization of related fields.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py** includes the `ForeignKey` class and its methods for initialization (`__init__`), attribute name retrieval (`get_attname`, `get_attname_column`), and database preparation for foreign key values (`get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, `get_prep_value`). These methods are essential for the correct handling of foreign key relationships and the data associated with them.\n\n3. **django/db/models/options.py** contains the `Options` class, which manages various model options and metadata, including the handling of primary keys (`setup_pk`) and proxy models (`setup_proxy`), which could be relevant to understanding model configurations affecting the saving process.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the search results, the identified code spans are directly relevant to the scenarios described. They provide a foundation for understanding how related objects are managed and saved in Django, especially in cases involving non-auto primary keys. Therefore, these code spans should be thoroughly analyzed to determine their role in the issue described.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to a data loss scenario when saving a parent object after setting a related child object with a non-numeric primary key. The problem arises due to the foreign key not being properly updated with the child's primary key value, leading to an empty string being set instead. This issue is critical as it can lead to data integrity issues and foreign key violations.\n\nThe analysis of the current file context and the new search results reveals several relevant code spans that can be associated with this issue. These include the initialization of models, the handling of foreign key relations, and the saving mechanisms. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py**\n   - The `Model.__init__` span handles the initialization of model instances, which is crucial when setting related objects.\n   - The `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` spans are responsible for saving parent objects and managing the saving of tables, respectively.\n   - The `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` span is essential as it prepares related fields for saving, which can be a point of failure if the related object's primary key is not properly handled.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**\n   - The `ForeignKey.__init__` and `ForeignKey.get_attname` spans are relevant as they deal with the initialization and attribute name generation for foreign key fields.\n   - The `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value`, and `ForeignKey.get_prep_value` spans handle database preparation for saving and value preparation, which are crucial steps in ensuring the foreign key is correctly set.\n\n3. **django/db/models/options.py**\n   - The `Options.setup_pk` and `Options.setup_proxy` spans are relevant for setting up primary keys and proxy models, which can impact how foreign keys are handled.\n\nFrom the new search results, additional spans such as `Model._get_pk_val`, `Model._set_pk_val`, `Model.save`, `Model._do_update`, and `Model._do_insert` further reinforce the relevance of the previously identified spans. These spans are directly involved in the operations that could lead to the data loss issue if the primary key handling is not robust.\n\nGiven this detailed analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue and should be sufficient to address the potential causes and implement corrective measures to handle non-numeric primary keys properly.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
