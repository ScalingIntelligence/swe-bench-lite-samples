Specifically, the foreign key field in the parent model (Order) does not get updated with the correct primary key value from the child model (Product) if the child model is initialized without a primary key and then later assigned a primary key value.\n\nFrom the search results, several code spans are relevant:\n\n1. The `Model._save_parents` method in `django/db/models/base.py`: This method handles saving related parent instances. It is crucial for understanding how the primary key values are propagated between related models.\n\n2. The `Model._save_table` method: This method is responsible for saving the model instance to the database. It checks if the primary key is set and handles the saving process accordingly.\n\n3. The `Model.__init__` method: This initializes the model instance and sets the fields, which is relevant when a new instance of Product is created and assigned to Order.\n\n4. The `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: This class is used to define the foreign key relationship between models, and its `__init__` method is relevant for understanding how the foreign key is handled initially.\n\nThese code spans collectively provide insight into the initialization, saving, and relationship management between models with non-auto primary keys, which is directly related to the reported issue. Further analysis of these spans should help determine if the issue is in the way foreign key fields are handled during the saving process.",

Specifically, the issue arises when a related instance's primary key is set after the instance has already been assigned to the parent, leading to data loss as the parent instance doesn't recognize the change. This impacts the saving mechanism and foreign key constraints.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the code spans relevant to the issue are found in two primary files:\n1. \"django/db/models/base.py\" - This file contains the core Model class definition and its methods, including '__init__', '_save_parents', '_save_table', and '_prepare_related_fields_for_save'. These methods handle the initialization, saving, and preparation of related fields for save operations. They are crucial for understanding how Django manages model instances and their relationships during save operations.\n2. \"django/db/models/fields/related.py\" - This file contains the definitions for RelatedField, ForeignObject, and ForeignKey classes. These classes are essential for handling foreign key relationships. The ForeignKey class's '__init__', 'validate', 'resolve_related_fields', and other methods are particularly relevant as they manage the construction, validation, and resolution of foreign key fields. These methods are critical for ensuring that foreign key relationships are correctly established and managed.\n\nThe identified code spans in these files provide a comprehensive view of how Django constructs and manages model instances with foreign key relationships, particularly in the context of saving operations and the handling of non-auto primary keys. This analysis is crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.",

The issue arises when the foreign key relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined. The foreign key field does not update to reflect this change, leading to data loss. The critical parts of the issue are the handling of the foreign key assignment and the updating of the primary key.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the relevant parts include the initialization of the model and the handling of related fields during save operations. Particularly, the `_save_table` and `_save_parents` methods in `django/db/models/base.py` are crucial for understanding how related fields are managed during the save process. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class and its methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are central to how foreign key relations are defined and managed.\n\nThe search results provide additional insights into the `save`, `save_base`, `_save_parents`, and `_save_table` methods in `django/db/models/base.py`, which are key to understanding the lifecycle of saving a model instance and managing related fields.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
