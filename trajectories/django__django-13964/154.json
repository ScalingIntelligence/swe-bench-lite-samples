The key elements identified in the issue are the foreign key relation, handling of unsaved instances, and how primary keys are managed during the save operation. Upon reviewing the search results, several relevant code spans are identified that are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue. These spans include the `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods, which handle the saving of related objects and the primary key value determination. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class's methods like `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `get_prep_value` are relevant as they deal with the preparation of foreign key values for database storage. The `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` method is also significant as it pertains to preparing related fields before saving, which might be where the primary key assignment issue arises. The presence of these code spans indicates that the search results are relevant and provide a good starting point for further analysis and potential fixes related to the reported issue.",
