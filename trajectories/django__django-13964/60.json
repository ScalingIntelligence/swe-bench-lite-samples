The problem arises when saving a parent object after setting it on a child object that has an empty instance without a primary key initially. The parent object does not recognize the change in the primary key of the child object, leading to data loss or incorrect persistence. This may involve specific methods and logic related to saving related objects, handling of primary keys, and foreign key constraints. Therefore, I should focus my search on the `ForeignKey` and `Model` classes and related methods that handle saving objects, primary key assignment, and foreign key relationships.",

The issue arises when the related instance is initialized with an empty primary key and subsequently assigned to the parent object without properly updating the foreign key field. To address this, we need to identify sections of the code that handle the initialization, assignment, and saving of related objects, particularly focusing on how the primary key value is managed. From the provided search results, several code spans are relevant:\n1. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the '__init__' method of the Model class handles the initialization of model instances, including the assignment of related objects. It is crucial to review how the primary key value of the related object is set and propagated to the parent object.\n2. The '_save_parents' and '_save_table' methods are responsible for saving parent objects and managing the insertion or update of table rows, respectively. These methods need to be inspected to ensure that the primary key value of the related object is correctly propagated and saved.\n3. In 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the 'ForeignKey' class and its methods such as '__init__', 'get_attname', 'get_default', and 'contribute_to_related_class' manage the behavior of foreign key fields. It is essential to ensure that these methods handle the non-auto primary key correctly and propagate changes appropriately.\nBy focusing on these sections, we can identify key areas where the primary key handling might be causing the issue and determine if the search results provide sufficient context to address the problem.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
