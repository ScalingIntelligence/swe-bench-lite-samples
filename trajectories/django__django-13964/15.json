The search results provided include significant code spans from the 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' files, which are highly relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue. Specifically, the 'Model._save_parents', 'Model._save_table', and 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' methods in 'base.py' handle the saving logic for parent objects and related fields, which is directly connected to the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'ForeignKey' and 'OneToOneField' classes in 'related.py' are responsible for managing foreign key relationships, which are crucial for the scenario described. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how Django manages model saving and foreign key relationships, essential for addressing the reported issue.",

Specifically, the _save_table method deals with saving the table and handling the primary key, which is crucial for the issue reported. Additionally, the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in related.py define how foreign keys and one-to-one relationships are managed, including the logic for setting and validating these relationships.

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
