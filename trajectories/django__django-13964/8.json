The problem arises when saving a parent object after setting it on a child, leading to data loss. The primary key is not being correctly propagated or recognized, causing an empty string to be set as the foreign key ID. To address this, we need to find where the foreign key relationship is being handled and how primary keys are managed during save operations. Searching through the given files to locate methods handling foreign key assignment, saving models, and primary key management is crucial.",

The key elements to focus on are the handling of foreign key relationships and the primary key assignment during the save operations.\n\nIn the provided codebase, several relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` files. These spans include methods and attributes related to saving models, handling foreign keys, and managing primary keys.\n\nIn `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.save` method is responsible for saving the model instance, which includes setting deferred fields, handling primary keys, and managing transactions. The `Model.get_deferred_fields` method checks for fields that are deferred, and the `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` method prepares related fields for saving, which is crucial for ensuring that foreign key relationships are correctly set.\n\nIn `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey` class and its methods are particularly relevant. Methods like `ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields`, `ForeignKey.get_attname`, and `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save` handle the resolution of related fields, attribute name generation, and database preparation of foreign key values, respectively. These methods are essential for correctly managing the foreign key relationship between the parent and child models.\n\nGiven the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue, it is determined that these are relevant code spans to investigate further for the reported issue involving data loss related to non-numeric primary keys and foreign key relationships.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
