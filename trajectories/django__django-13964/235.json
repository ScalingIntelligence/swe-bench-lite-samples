The key steps to identify relevant code spans are to look for methods and attributes related to saving objects, setting primary keys, and handling related objects. The search results provide several code spans in the Model and ForeignKey classes in Django's `django/db/models/` directory. Relevant spans include `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`, and `ForeignKey.__init__`. These spans cover the initialization of models, the handling of primary keys, and the saving process of related objects. Specifically, `Model.__init__` initializes the model instance, `Model._save_parents` manages the saving of parent objects, `Model._save_table` handles the saving of the table, and `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` prepares related fields for save. Additionally, `ForeignKey.__init__` initializes the ForeignKey field, which is central to the reported issue. After examining these spans, it is clear that they are relevant to the reported issue and provide a good starting point for understanding how the problem might be addressed.",
