The problem arises when the primary key is set after the relationship is initialized, leading to data inconsistencies. This might involve how Django handles the saving and assignment of related fields, particularly in the context of deferred fields and transaction atomicity. To resolve this, we need to locate the relevant parts of the code that manage these operations. This includes examining the fields related to ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and how model instances are saved and their related fields handled. Notably, the problem might be intertwined with the deferred field mechanism and transaction handling in Django's ORM.",

The issue arises when the primary key is set after initializing the related model instance. The provided code spans from `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` are relevant to this issue as they contain definitions and implementations of the `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` classes, which are critical for managing foreign key relationships in Django models. Additionally, the `Model` class's `__init__` method and related save methods are examined for how they handle field assignments and persistence. The identified code spans, particularly `ForeignKey.__init__` and `Model.__init__`, are pivotal for understanding how foreign key values are set and how models are initialized, which directly impacts the reported issue of data loss. These code spans are thus relevant and should be further analyzed in the context of the reported issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
