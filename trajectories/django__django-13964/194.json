The issue specifically involves the handling of primary keys and foreign key relations in Django models. The relevant parts of the codebase to investigate are those that deal with saving models, particularly the `save_base` and `_save_table` methods in `django/db/models/base.py`, as well as the `ForeignKey` class and its methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. These sections of the code handle the logic for saving model instances, managing foreign key relationships, and preparing data for database insertion. By examining these code spans, we can understand how the primary key and foreign key fields are processed and saved, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue. The spans identified as relevant are those that include logic for saving parents and tables, handling primary key values, and managing foreign key relations. Additionally, the `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save` and `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value` methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are crucial for understanding how foreign key data is prepared for saving in the database, which is directly related to the issue of data loss when the primary key is not properly propagated.",
