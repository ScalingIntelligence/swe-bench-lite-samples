It involves the correct assignment and saving of related models with non-numeric primary keys, specifically focusing on the Product and Order models.

Additionally, 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py' may provide insight into how fields and deletions are managed within these relationships.",

The issue stems from the parent not 'seeing' the primary key's change and thus not updating the foreign key correctly. This is evident in the `Model.save` method and related methods such as `_save_parents` and `_save_table` in `django/db/models/base.py`. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is relevant as it handles the behavior of foreign key relationships, including methods like `get_attname`, `get_attname_column`, `get_default`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `get_prep_value`. These methods are crucial for understanding how foreign keys are managed and potentially where the issue arises with non-numeric primary keys. Furthermore, the `CharField` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is related as it defines how character fields, including potential primary keys, are handled. The deletion behaviors defined in `django/db/models/deletion.py` are also relevant context for understanding transaction management and potential data integrity issues.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
