This occurs specifically in cases where the parent has a non-numeric primary key (a CharField in this case). The issue is related to how the foreign key (`product_id`) is being assigned and saved when the parent object is not yet saved and its primary key not defined at the assignment time.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the code spans within the `Model` class, particularly `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, and `Model._save_table`, are highly relevant. These methods deal with the instantiation of model instances, saving related parent models, and handling the saving of the model's table respectively, all of which are critical in understanding the root cause of the issue and potential solutions.\n\nThe `Model.__init__` method handles the initial assignment of fields when a model instance is created, and it considers whether the fields are related objects and how they should be set without prematurely saving. This is directly relevant as it deals with how related fields are being handled during initialization.\n\nThe `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods are also crucial as they deal with the actual persistence of data to the database, including handling of primary keys and how updates or inserts are performed. These methods will help in understanding the flow of data and how the primary key and foreign key relationships are managed during these operations.\n\nGiven these context clues, the identified spans within the `Model` class appear to be highly relevant towards addressing the issues described in the reported case.",

The problem arises when saving the parent object after setting it on a child, leading to data loss due to the parent's primary key not being properly propagated to the child. This issue can be traced to how the primary key is handled during the initialization and saving process of the models.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, especially in the `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` files, we can identify key sections of code that are likely involved in the issue. The `Model.__init__` method in `base.py` initializes the model instance, setting attributes based on the provided arguments and kwargs. The `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods are also crucial as they handle the saving process, including managing the propagation of primary keys between related models.\n\nIn `related.py`, the `ForeignKey` class and its methods, such as `__init__`, `get_attname`, and `get_db_prep_save`, are particularly relevant. These methods define how the foreign key field behaves, including its initialization and how it prepares values for database storage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant as they directly involve the operations and checks necessary to address the reported issue concerning foreign key handling and primary key propagation during save operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The main problem occurs when the primary key of the related model is set after initializing the relation on the parent model, leading to data loss as the parent model doesn't 'see' the change in the primary key. This issue is evident in the code handling the initialization and saving of models, particularly in the `Model.__init__` and `Model._save_parents` methods. The new search results confirm these findings and provide more detailed methods such as `Model._get_pk_val`, `Model._set_pk_val`, `Model._do_update`, and `Model._do_insert` which are crucial for understanding how primary keys and related fields are handled during save operations. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class methods like `get_attname`, `get_db_prep_save`, and `contribute_to_related_class` are relevant as they deal directly with the foreign key field handling and its relation to the primary key of the related model. These methods and their implementations are critical for addressing the issue of data loss when dealing with non-numeric primary keys in related models.",

Additionally, the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in the related.py file provide further context on how foreign keys are defined and handled in Django models. While this file context doesn't cover every method and detail necessary to fully resolve the issue, it provides a solid foundation to understand and diagnose the problem concerning non-auto primary keys and their management in foreign key relationships.

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
