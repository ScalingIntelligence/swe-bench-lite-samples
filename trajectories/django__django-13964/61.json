This occurs when the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined. The parent does not 'see' the primary key's change, leading to the foreign key being set to an empty string instead of the actual primary key value.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans can be found in the `Model` class definition, specifically in the `__init__` method and the `_save_parents` method. These methods handle the initialization and saving of related objects. The `__init__` method manages the assignment of values to fields, including handling related objects. The `_save_parents` method is responsible for saving parent objects and managing the synchronization of link fields between parent and self.\n\nThe code spans identified include:\n- `Model.__init__`: This span contains the logic for initializing a model instance, including handling related objects and setting their values.\n- `Model._save_parents`: This span contains the logic for saving parent objects and managing the synchronization of link fields between parent and self.
