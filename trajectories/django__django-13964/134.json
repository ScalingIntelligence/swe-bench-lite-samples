This can lead to data inconsistencies if the primary key is not correctly updated before saving the related model. The provided context suggests that the problem might be related to how the `Order.product_id` field is handled at assignment and how the `Order` model interacts with the `Product` model during save operations. Specifically, the `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, and `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` methods in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are areas of focus.",

There are two key files that can help identify the relevant code: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the '_save_parents', '_save_table', and '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' code spans are relevant. These methods handle the saving of the parent and child objects and the preparation of related fields before saving, respectively. The '_save_parents' method ensures the parent object's primary key is correctly updated when the child object is saved. The '_save_table' method handles the actual saving of the table, which could be relevant for understanding how the primary key is handled during this process. The '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' method's responsibility of preparing related fields before saving can also be related to the issue.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the 'ForeignKey' class and its initialization (__init__) and validation (validate) methods are relevant. The 'ForeignKey' class handles the relationship between two models, which is critical for addressing the immediate issue of the foreign key not reflecting changes in related objects. The '__init__' method sets up the foreign key relationship, indicating how the primary key is expected to be handled. The 'validate' method ensures the foreign key is correctly validated with related objects, which is directly related to preventing data loss described in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
