The problem surfaces when the parent object is saved after setting a child with an initially empty primary key, which subsequently gets defined. It is suspected that this may involve how the primary key and foreign keys are handled during assignment and saving processes. Given the description and the relevant files, a targeted search for methods and classes involved in handling primary keys, foreign keys, and saving related models might uncover the root cause. Specifically, looking into methods like `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, and `validate` in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` may lead to the cause of the discrepancy.",
