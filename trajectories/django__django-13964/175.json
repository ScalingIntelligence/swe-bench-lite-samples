            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around saving parent objects after setting on child objects leading to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys. This involves a foreign key relationship between two models, Product and Order, where Product has a CharField as its primary key. The issue arises when the foreign key relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined. The relevant code spans should focus on how the primary key and foreign key relationships are handled during the save process.\n\nThe provided search results include several key sections of code in the `django/db/models/base.py` file that handle model saving, primary key handling, and related field operations. Specifically, the `Model.save`, `Model.save_base`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, and `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` methods are particularly relevant. These methods deal with the saving of model instances, handling of parent models and fields, and preparation of related fields for save operations. The `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` also contains methods relevant to the handling of foreign key relationships and their associated fields.\n\nGiven the complexity of handling primary keys and foreign key relationships, these code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue of data loss when saving parent objects with non-numeric primary keys.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
