The current understanding is that when a related instance (Product) is first created without its primary key and then the primary key is assigned before saving, the foreign key relationship on the parent instance (Order) might not be properly updated, leading to data loss. This could be due to how the Order's product_id field is managed when assigning the Product instance, potentially not reacting to later changes in the Product instance's primary key before saving. To address this, we should focus our search on the handling of foreign key relationships in Django, specifically in the '_save_parents', '_save_table', and 'contribute_to_related_class' methods, as well as the setting and updating of primary keys in the related instances.",

The problem arises when initializing a foreign key relationship with an empty instance of the parent model and then setting the primary key later. This can lead to data loss or incorrect foreign key references. We need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the assignment and saving of foreign key relationships, especially handling when primary keys are set after initialization.\n\nFrom the search results, we see several relevant code spans.\n\n1. 'ForeignKey' and 'ForeignKey.__init__' in django/db/models/fields/related.py: These span ids relate to the ForeignKey class, which is central to defining foreign key relationships in Django models.\n2. 'Model.__init__' in django/db/models/base.py: This pertains to the initialization of model instances, including handling of related objects and their keys.\n3. 'Model._save_parents' and 'Model._save_table' in django/db/models/base.py: These methods are involved in the saving process, particularly for parent instances and updating or inserting table rows, which could be key for understanding and addressing the issue.\n\nThese code spans are crucial as they cover the initialization and saving mechanisms of models with foreign key relationships, where the handling of non-auto primary keys, such as CharFields, will be pivotal to resolving the reported issue.",
