The problem is caused by the handling of foreign keys and primary keys in the Django ORM, specifically when dealing with non-auto CharField primary keys. It seems related to how the primary key is handled when the related instance is saved, and how the foreign key field (Order.product_id) is updated in the database. Possible relevant areas for investigation include the Model class for saving related fields and the ForeignKey class for processing foreign keys.",

The issue highlights a scenario where setting the foreign key on a parent object after initializing it leads to data loss, specifically when the primary key of the related model is not yet defined.\n\nTo understand and potentially resolve this issue, we need to focus on how Django handles the saving of related objects, specifically the ForeignKey relationships. The provided search results contain several relevant sections of code from Django's `db/models/base.py` and `db/models/fields/related.py` which deal with model saving, foreign key relationships, and primary key handling.\n\nThe section `Model._save_parents` is of particular interest, as it specifically deals with saving parent models and synchronizing their primary keys. The `Model._save_table` section is also relevant as it handles the actual saving of the model's table in the database, including conditions around primary key handling.\n\nThe `ForeignKey` class in `db/models/fields/related.py` also contains several methods that could be relevant to understanding how foreign keys are handled, particularly in the context of different types of primary keys (numeric vs non-numeric).\n\nBy examining these sections, we can further determine which code spans are most relevant to the reported issue, and whether the provided search results are sufficient to address the issue or if further investigation is needed.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
