It seems the problem lies in how the primary key and foreign key values are managed during the save process, especially when the primary key is set after the instance initialization. Investigating the models where foreign key relationships are defined and related management logic could be insightful. Also, examining the fields related to saving operations and the handling of primary key values is crucial.",

In 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the code spans related to ForeignKey and RelatedField, especially the 'ForeignKey.__init__', 'ForeignKey.validate', 'ForeignKey.get_attname', and 'ForeignKey.get_attname_column' methods, are relevant as they handle the instantiation and validation of ForeignKey fields. In 'django/db/models/base.py', 'Model._save_parents', 'Model._save_table', and 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' offer context on how Django handles saving related models, which is pertinent to understanding the issue of data loss during parent-child transaction.

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
