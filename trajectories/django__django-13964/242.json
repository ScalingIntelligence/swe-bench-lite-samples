Specifically, when the related instance is initialized with an empty primary key and later updated, the foreign key in the parent object does not reflect this change correctly. This can lead to data inconsistency and potential data loss. To address this, we need to look into the core Django model handling, particularly how foreign keys and primary keys are managed during object creation and updates. The relevant files identified from the Django codebase are: django/db/models/base.py, django/db/models/fields/related.py, django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, and django/db/models/deletion.py. These files contain the logic for model saving, foreign key handling, and deletion cascading. Additionally, django/db/models/query.py might also be relevant as it deals with object population and query operations.",

The issue arises when the parent model is saved before its primary key is set, leading to data loss or incorrect foreign key values.\n\nIn the provided search results, there are several code spans that are relevant to this issue. These include methods in the `Model` class such as `_get_pk_val`, `_set_pk_val`, and `_save_parents`. These methods deal directly with the primary key and the saving of related parent models, which are directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is relevant as it handles the behavior of foreign key fields in Django models. The methods `get_db_prep_save` and `get_prep_value` in this class are particularly relevant as they handle the conversion and preparation of foreign key values for saving to the database. The `save` method in `DeserializedObject` is also relevant as it deals with saving deserialized objects, which could be directly related to the issue if deserialization and saving processes are involved. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive context and potential points of intervention to address the reported issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
