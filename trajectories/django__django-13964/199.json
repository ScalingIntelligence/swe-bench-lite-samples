This could be related to the handling of foreign keys and primary keys in Django's model system, specifically in how the primary key is assigned and propagated during save operations. It's important to look into how Django handles related fields, especially when dealing with non-auto primary keys. The focus should be on the '_save_parents', '_save_table', and '_perform_unique_checks' methods in 'django/db/models/base.py', and the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', as these are crucial for understanding how foreign keys and primary keys interact.",

Two files are identified as potentially relevant based on their content: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. The first file contains the 'Model' class which has methods '_save_parents' and '_save_table' that deal with saving model instances and their relations. The second file contains the 'ForeignKey' class which is directly related to the foreign key functionality described in the issue. The methods in the 'ForeignKey' class that are identified as relevant include '__init__', 'check', 'to_python', 'get_reverse_path_info', 'validate', 'get_attname', 'formfield', 'db_type', and 'get_col'. These methods cover various aspects of the foreign key's functionality, including initialization, validation, and database operations, which are likely to be involved in resolving the reported issue. Thus, these files and methods are identified as relevant for further investigation and potential fixes.",
