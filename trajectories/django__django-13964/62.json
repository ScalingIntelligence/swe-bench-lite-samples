            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it is clear that the problem lies in how the foreign key relationship is handled when the primary key of the related model is not auto-incremented. Specifically, the issue arises when the primary key is a CharField and the related instance is saved before its primary key is set. This results in the foreign key field in the parent model not being updated correctly.\n\nGiven this context, the search results contain relevant sections of the Django codebase that deal with ForeignKey relationships. The 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' are both directly related to how model relationships are managed in Django.\n\nIn particular, the 'ForeignKey.__init__', 'ForeignKey.get_instance_value_for_fields', and 'Model.__init__' sections are highly relevant. The '__init__' methods are crucial for understanding how instances are initialized, and 'get_instance_value_for_fields' method is directly concerned with how the fields' values are retrieved from the instance, which could be a source of the issue if the primary key is not correctly fetched.\n\nAdditionally, the 'ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class' and 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' methods are also relevant as they handle the contribution of the foreign key to the related class and the preparation of related fields before saving, respectively. These methods could potentially include checks or adjustments needed to solve the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, these sections of the code are likely to contain the necessary logic to address the reported issue regarding the handling of foreign key relationships with non-numeric primary keys.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
