The key elements identified in the issue include: 1) A model with a non-auto CharField as its primary key (Product), 2) A foreign key relationship to this model (Order), 3) The need to handle initializations where the primary key is set after an empty instance is assigned to the parent. The relevant code spans should outline the handling of model saving, particularly focusing on the save method, and how the primary key and foreign key relationships are managed. The provided search results include several code spans that are pertinent to this issue, particularly in the handling of model saving, foreign key relationships, and primary key assignments. For example, the 'Model.save' span outlines the save method, which is crucial for understanding how objects are persisted. The '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' span is relevant as it checks related fields before save, which is critical for ensuring the foreign key is correctly set. Similarly, the 'ForeignKey.get_attname', 'ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save', and 'ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value' spans in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' are relevant for understanding how foreign key values are handled and prepared for saving in the database. These spans collectively provide insight into the management of primary keys and foreign key relationships, which are central to addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
