The problem arises because the child object does not correctly update its foreign key reference when the parent's primary key changes after assignment.\n\n\nThe search results provided contain key areas in the Django ORM that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. The `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` - This is the foundation for the foreign key relationship between models. The `ForeignKey.__init__` method is of particular interest as it initializes the foreign key relationship, including setting the `to_field` attribute, which could be relevant to ensuring the correct primary key value is used.\n\n2. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` - This is the base class for all Django models. Methods such as `Model.__init__` and `Model._save_parents` are directly involved in object initialization and saving, including handling related objects. These methods will help in understanding how the primary key of the parent object is being handled during the child object's save process.\n\nBoth sections of code are relevant to the reported issue as they deal with key aspects of how Django models and foreign key relationships are defined and managed. The `ForeignKey` definition is crucial for understanding the setup of the foreign key relationship, while the `Model` methods are important for understanding the saving and initialization processes, including how related objects are handled.",

The provided search results and context focus on the Django ORM's handling of related fields, specifically ForeignKey and model initialization and saving. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the search results align with the issue:\n\n1. The issue seems to be centered around how Django handles the assignment and tracking of primary keys, especially when the related instance is not yet saved. The code spans related to ForeignKey initialization and the `__init__` method of the Model class are relevant because they show how Django sets up relationships and how instances are initialized.\n2. The method `_save_parents` and the handling of related fields in the `__init__` method are particularly relevant as they demonstrate how Django handles the saving of parent objects and the synchronization of fields between related objects.\n3. Additional scrutiny should be given to the handling of primary keys in the `_get_pk_val`, `_set_pk_val`, and the `get_db_prep_save` methods, as these methods are crucial for correctly persisting primary key values in the database, which directly relates to the issue's concern about data loss due to incorrect primary key handling.\n4. Methods like `resolve_related_fields` and `contribute_to_related_class` are explored for their role in ensuring that the fields and related classes are correctly set up and that any issues in these areas could contribute to the symptoms described in the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the areas in Django's ORM that are pertinent to solving or understanding the specific issue reported, focusing on how primary keys, especially non-numeric ones, are managed within relational assignments and model instance initialization.",
