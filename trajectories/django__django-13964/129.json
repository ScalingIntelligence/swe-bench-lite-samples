The primary key of the Product model is a CharField, which is non-auto and manually set. The problem arises when the Product instance is assigned to the Order before it has its primary key set, leading to data loss in the parent model. The search should focus on the `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` classes in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file as well as related descriptor classes like `ForwardOneToOneDescriptor` in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`. Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` might contain methods related to saving parents which could be relevant.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a scenario where a parent object does not properly update its foreign key relation when the child object's primary key is set after the child object is assigned to the parent. This leads to data loss because the foreign key field ends up being an empty string, which violates the foreign key constraint. The issue is particularly relevant when the child object has a non-auto CharField as its primary key.\n\nThe provided search results include code spans that could be relevant to solving this issue. Specifically, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is notable because it defines how foreign keys are handled in Django models. The `__init__`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `get_prep_value` methods in this class are crucial for understanding how foreign key values are prepared and saved.\n\nAdditionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is relevant because it contains methods like `save`, `save_base`, `_save_parents`, and `_save_table`, which are responsible for saving model instances and handling their relations. These methods are likely where the logic for updating foreign key relations and ensuring data consistency should be implemented.\n\nFinally, the `ForwardOneToOneDescriptor` class in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` contains a method `__set__` which could be relevant for handling the assignment of related instances, particularly when the primary key of the related instance is set after it has been assigned.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these code spans seem to be relevant for identifying the source of the problem and potentially resolving it.",
