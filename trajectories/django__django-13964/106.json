The problem occurs when the primary key is set after initializing the related Product object, leading to data loss for the Order's product_id field. The issue likely lies in how Django handles the assignment and saving of related objects, particularly in relation to non-auto primary keys and foreign keys.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant code spans are identified:\n\n1. '__Model._save_parents__' in 'django/db/models/base.py': This method handles saving parent objects and ensures the link fields are synced. It's crucial for understanding how related objects are handled during save operations.\n\n2. '__Model._save_table__' in 'django/db/models/base.py': This method is responsible for saving the table data and checks for primary key values before saving, which is relevant to the issue of unsaved primary keys.\n\n3. '__Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save__' in 'django/db/models/base.py': This method prepares related fields for save operations and checks if related objects have been saved, which is directly related to ensuring data integrity when saving related models.\n\n4. '__ForeignKey.get_attname__' in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py': This method returns the attribute name for the foreign key, which is relevant for understanding how foreign key fields are named and referenced.\n\n5. '__ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save__' in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py': This method prepares the value for database saving, which is crucial for understanding how foreign key values are handled before saving into the database.\n\n6. '__QuerySet.bulk_create__' in 'django/db/models/query.py': This method handles bulk creation of objects and ensures that related fields are prepared for save, which could affect how foreign keys are managed in bulk operations.\n\nThese code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve handling primary keys, foreign keys, and saving related objects in Django models.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
