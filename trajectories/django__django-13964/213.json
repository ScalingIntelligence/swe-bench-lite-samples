This could be due to how the primary key and foreign key relationships are handled, particularly with non-auto CharField primary keys. The problem seems to lie in the handling of the Order.product_id field when a Product object is assigned to it before saving.

Specifically, when the primary key is a non-auto CharField, and the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, the parent does not 'see' the primary key's change, leading to data loss. The search results contain several relevant code spans that provide a deeper understanding of how Django handles model initialization, foreign key relations, and deferred fields. For instance, the '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' method in the 'Model' class handles the preparation of related fields for save operations, which is critical for understanding how parent-child relationships are managed in Django. Additionally, the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' provides methods that deal with how foreign keys are managed and validated, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Furthermore, the 'Model' class's '__init__' method reveals how Django initializes models and handles field assignments, which is crucial for understanding how primary keys and foreign keys interact during model initialization. Given the depth of the issue, these code spans offer a good starting point for addressing the problem. They highlight the areas where additional checks or modifications might be needed to handle non-numeric primary keys and foreign key relations more effectively.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
