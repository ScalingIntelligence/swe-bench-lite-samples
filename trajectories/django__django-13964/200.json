The data loss occurs when initializing the foreign key relationship before the primary key is set on the related model. The primary keys involved are CharField and are not auto-generated. This suggests that the problem may lie in how Django handles the assignment and saving of fields with non-auto primary keys and their related foreign keys. We should focus our search on the methods and functions handling field assignment, saving logic, and primary key handling in Django's model base and related field classes. Given the context provided, the search should be targeted at the `django.db.models.base.Model` class, `django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignObject` and `ForeignKey` classes, and related methods that manage saving and field assignments.",
