The problem occurs when the primary key is assigned after initializing the relation, leading to data loss. This suggests that the issue might lie in how Django handles the assignment and saving of related fields, particularly in the overwritten methods for saving parents and tables. Also, since the foreign key is involved, it's crucial to examine how ForeignKey fields are processed and validated within Django's ORM. The files provided seem relevant, especially 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', where the core methods for saving models and handling foreign key relations are defined.",

The key elements to look for in the code spans are the handling of foreign key relationships, especially how primary keys are managed and how the parent-child relationship is saved. In the provided search results, several relevant code spans are found: 1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.__init__` span handles the initialization of model instances and the assignment of fields. This is relevant because it shows how fields, including foreign keys, are set during initialization. 2. The `Model._save_parents` span is also relevant as it deals with saving parents of a model instance, which is directly related to the issue of ensuring the parent's primary key is correctly saved when a child is saved. 3. In `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey.__init__` span is crucial as it initializes the ForeignKey field, which is central to the parent-child relationship in the reported issue. Other spans in this file, such as `ForeignKey.target_field` and `ForeignKey.get_attname`, are also relevant as they deal with aspects of how the ForeignKey is managed and how its attributes are handled. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how foreign key relationships are managed in Django, particularly in relation to saving parent objects with non-numeric primary keys.",
