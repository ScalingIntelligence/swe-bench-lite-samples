This can lead to data loss if the primary key is not properly set before saving. The problem is likely to be found in the handling of ForeignKey and OneToOneField relationships, particularly in the _save_parents, _save_table, and _prepare_related_fields_for_save methods within the Model class. Additionally, the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in django/db/models/fields/related.py might also be relevant, especially their methods for handling instance value extraction and database preparation.",

The main problem is that when a related object's primary key is set after initialization and before saving, the parent object (Order in this case) does not update its foreign key field (product_id) to reflect the related object's primary key (sku). The search results include relevant code spans from django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/fields/related.py. In django/db/models/base.py, the Model class's __init__ method handles the initialization of model instances, including setting related objects. This code appears relevant because it sets the foreign key attributes on the model instance. The _save_parents and _save_table methods also seem relevant as they handle saving related objects and their table respectively. In django/db/models/fields/related.py, the ForeignKey class and its methods get_db_prep_save, get_db_prep_value, and get_prep_value are relevant as they handle the database preparation and preparation of foreign key values. These methods are crucial for managing the foreign key relationships, ensuring that the foreign key field is correctly populated during database operations. Based on the reported issue and the search results, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the problem of foreign key handling with non-auto primary keys. The identified code spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue.",
