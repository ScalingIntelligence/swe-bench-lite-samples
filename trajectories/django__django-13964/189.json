Specifically, the issue arises when the primary key of the related model (Product) is a CharField that is not auto-generated. The problem involves the handling of foreign key relations and the assignment of primary keys during the save process. The provided search results include code spans from `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the initialization and saving of model instances, particularly those that involve foreign key relationships and the handling of primary keys. The identified spans include `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`, and `ForeignKey.__init__`. These spans are crucial for understanding how foreign key relationships are managed and how primary keys are set and updated during the save process. Given the detailed description of the issue and the code spans provided, these spans are sufficient to analyze the problem and identify potential areas for improvement or bug fixes related to the handling of non-numeric primary keys in foreign key relations.
