Notably, the behavior differs based on how the primary key is set and saved, indicating a focus on the ``_save_parents``, ``_save_table``, and ``contribute_to_class`` methods in the Model and Field classes, and the handling of related fields in ``ForeignKey`` and ``OneToOneField`` classes. Additional focus on deferred fields, transactions, and unique checks might also provide insights, given the transactional context provided in the issue.",
