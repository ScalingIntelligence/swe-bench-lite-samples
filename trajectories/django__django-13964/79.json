The key point is the handling of the primary key when saving the related objects in a foreign key relationship, particularly when the primary key is a non-auto CharField. This involves understanding how the foreign key value is set and how transactions and unique constraints are managed in Django's ORM.\n\nFrom the search results, several code spans are relevant:\n1. In django/db/models/base.py, the `prepare_database_save` method checks if the primary key is None and raises an error if it is, which is relevant to the handling of primary keys.\n2. The `_perform_unique_checks` method in the same file checks for unique constraints and handles the case where a foreign key value might be set incorrectly. This is crucial for understanding how unique constraints are enforced and could be related to the issue.\n3. In django/db/models/fields/related.py, the `ForeignKey._check_on_delete` method is relevant as it checks the on_delete behavior, which could indirectly relate to how foreign keys are handled.\n4. The `ForeignKey.deconstruct` method is also relevant as it manages the serialization of foreign keys, which might affect how foreign keys are saved and reloaded.\n\nThese code spans provide insights into how primary keys and foreign keys are managed, particularly in relation to the persistence of data and the enforcement of unique constraints. This analysis suggests that the issue with data loss could be related to how these mechanisms interact during transaction management and object saving.",
