The problem arises when trying to save a parent object after setting it on a child, specifically when the parent object's primary key is set after being assigned to the child. This results in data loss as the foreign key field in the child object is not properly updated. To address this, we need to search for code relevant to how Django handles saving related objects and primary key assignment.",

The focus is on how the foreign key relation updates the parent's field when the child's primary key is not set until after an initial assignment. Given the context and the specific issue, the relevant sections of the code are primarily found in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', especially the sections related to 'ForeignKey' and its methods 'get_db_prep_save', 'get_db_prep_value', and 'get_prep_value'. These methods are involved in preparing the foreign key values for database operations, and issues might arise if the child's primary key isn't properly handled or recognized at this stage, especially when it's not set before. Additionally, the methods from 'django/db/models/base.py', particularly 'Model.__init__', 'Model._save_parents', and 'Model._save_table' are essential as they handle the instantiation of model objects and the saving process, which could involve updates that fail to properly recognize the altered primary key. These sections together are crucial for understanding and possibly correcting the problem where the parent does not correctly 'see' updates to a child's primary key after initial assignment.",

The current implementation in `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save` does not correctly handle the case where the primary key is set after the foreign key relationship is initialized. This leads to data loss as the foreign key is not updated to reflect the newly set primary key of the related object. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the foreign key field is re-evaluated and updated before saving the child object if the related object's primary key has been changed. Considering the complexity of the problem, a possible fix could be to add logic in the `_save_table` method to re-evaluate foreign key fields if their related objects have changed, ensuring that the `product_id` in the `Order.save` method correctly reflects the updated `sku` in the `Product` object, even if it was set after the initial assignment.",
