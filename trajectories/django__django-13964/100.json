This likely involves the handling of foreign keys and the save logic within Django's ORM. To address this, I need to focus on the ForeignKey and Model classes, particularly how the _save_parents and _save_table methods handle the relationship between parent and child models when the child's primary key is non-auto and not yet defined. Additionally, I should look into the Deferred class and how deferred fields are managed during the save process.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The problem occurs when the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined. This leads to the parent not 'seeing' the primary key's change, resulting in data loss. The relevant code spans to investigate are those that handle the initialization of models and the saving of related objects, particularly where foreign key relations are managed.\n\nFrom the search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n1. 'Model.__init__' - This is where the model instance is initialized and attributes are set. It involves handling of args and kwargs, which is crucial for understanding how the primary key and foreign key relations are set up.\n2. 'Model._save_parents' - This method deals with saving related parent models, which is significant in the context of ensuring that changes in related models are properly propagated.\n3. 'Model._save_table' - This deals with saving the actual table data, including handling of primary keys and updates. It's important for understanding how the primary key is handled when saving instances.\n\nThese code spans directly relate to the core functions needed to resolve the reported issue: initializing model instances, managing foreign key relations, and saving model data. Further inspection of these spans is essential to understand how to address the issue of data loss caused by improper handling of non-auto primary keys in foreign key relations.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
