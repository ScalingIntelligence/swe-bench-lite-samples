The problem occurs when a product is assigned to an order without an initial primary key, which later results in the foreign key field being set to an empty string. This is likely due to how the foreign key relationship is handled at assignment and how the primary keys are managed. To pinpoint the exact code causing this behavior, it would be beneficial to search in the context of ForeignKey handling, primary key management, and model saving mechanisms in Django's ORM.",

The key elements identified in the issue include the models 'Product' and 'Order' with a foreign key relationship, and the handling of the primary key 'sku' in the 'Product' model. \n\nThe search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'Model' and 'ForeignKey' classes. The 'Model' class contains the '__init__', '_get_pk_val', '_set_pk_val', '_save_parents', '_save_table', and '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' methods, which are directly related to the lifecycle and management of model instances, including their primary keys and related fields. These methods handle the initialization, saving, and validation of model instances, which are crucial for understanding how the primary key and foreign key relationships are managed.\n\nIn the 'ForeignKey' class, the '__init__', 'validate', 'resolve_related_fields', and 'contribute_to_related_class' methods are relevant. These methods deal with the configuration and validation of foreign key relationships, which are central to the issue's description. Specifically, the 'validate' method ensures that the foreign key value references an existing instance, which is critical when dealing with non-numeric primary keys like 'sku'.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these code spans provide a good starting point for understanding and potentially resolving the problem of data loss when dealing with non-numeric primary keys in a foreign key relationship.",
