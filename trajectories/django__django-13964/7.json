The problem arises when the foreign key relation is initialized with an empty instance of the parent that doesn't specify its primary key, and then the primary key is defined later. This leads to the foreign key not being updated correctly. Given the context provided, it's likely that the issue involves how the ForeignKey field handles the assignment and saving of related instances. The search should focus on the ForeignKey class and related methods in the Django models and fields modules. The scenario provided suggests that the _save_table and _save_parents methods in models.base and the ForeignKey class in fields.related might be relevant.",

This is crucial for understanding how the foreign key is set initially.\n2. Also in 'django/db/models/base.py', the '_save_parents' and '_save_table' methods are where the actual saving of the model data to the database occurs.

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
