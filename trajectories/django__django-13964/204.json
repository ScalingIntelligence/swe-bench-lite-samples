Specifically, when a parent model with a non-auto CharField primary key is set on a child model before the primary key is defined, the foreign key in the child model is set to an empty string, leading to a ForeignKeyViolation on transaction commit. The search results provided contain several relevant spans of code from Django's `related.py` and `base.py` files, which are core to handling relationships and model instances respectively. These spans include the `ForeignKey` class definition, the `__init__`, `validate`, `get_db_prep_save`, and `contribute_to_related_class` methods of the `ForeignKey` class, and the `Model` class and its methods `__init__`, `_save_parents`, and `_save_table`. These methods are crucial for understanding how Django handles model initialization, saving related objects, and ensuring foreign key constraints. The sections on `get_db_prep_save` and `validate` are particularly important as they deal directly with preparing and validating foreign key values before they are saved to the database, which is at the heart of the reported issue. Thus, these code spans are highly relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue of data loss in the described scenario.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
