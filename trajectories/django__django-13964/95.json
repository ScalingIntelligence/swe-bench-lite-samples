The problem seems to arise when the primary key is set after the instance is assigned to the parent model. The transaction Atomicity is also a critical factor here, as the transaction fails on commit, indicating a potential issue with how the primary key and foreign key are managed during the save process. To address this issue, we should focus on the foreign key handling and transaction management in the Django models, specifically in the modules `base.py`, `related.py`, `fields/__init__.py`, and `deletion.py`, and possibly others involved in these processes.",

The main problem occurs when the primary key is set after the relation is initialized, leading to data loss. This issue is closely related to how the foreign key value is assigned and updated in the database, especially when the primary key is set after the initial assignment. Based on the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'django/db/models/base.py' file, specifically within the Model class definition. The identified spans include methods and properties that handle the setting and getting of the primary key value, the save method which manages the persistence of the model instance, and the method that prepares related fields for save. These spans are directly relevant to the reported issue because they involve the core logic that handles primary key assignment, foreign key relation handling, and model save operations. The identified code spans should be sufficient to understand and address the issue of data loss when saving parent objects after setting on child with a non-numeric primary key.",

The issue description suggests problems when handling related objects with non-auto primary keys during the save process, and the provided file context seems to directly address these concerns. Notably, the method `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` includes checks and operations that would be crucial for preventing data loss related to unsaved related objects, which is a key concern in the issue.
