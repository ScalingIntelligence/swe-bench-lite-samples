The problem arises when setting the foreign key relationship between the parent and child models and not handling the primary key correctly. The search should focus on the handling of foreign key relationships, primary key assignments, and deferred field management in Django's model and field classes. The relevant files from the context also suggest a focus on how models are saved, how primary keys are managed, and how related fields are handled during the save process.",

The relevant code spans in the search results are those that handle the ForeignKey relationships, particularly how the primary key value of the related instance is managed and assigned. The spans that are particularly relevant include the initialization of the ForeignKey in 'ForeignKey.__init__', the method 'ForeignKey.get_attname', which determines the attribute name for the foreign key, and 'ForeignObject.get_instance_value_for_fields', which fetches the value of the primary key from the related instance. Additionally, the 'Model.__init__' method is important as it initializes the instance and could be where the primary key assignment issue might occur if not handled correctly. The 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' method is also relevant as it checks and prepares related fields before saving, which might involve ensuring the foreign key is set correctly.",

The key elements in the issue are the models `Product` and `Order` with a foreign key relation, and the handling of the foreign key (specifically `Order.product_id`) when the related `Product` instance has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The issue occurs when the `Product` instance is saved without a primary key initially, and then its primary key is set and saved, but the `Order` instance does not reflect this change. This involves understanding how the foreign key value is set and how the transaction is managed.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in both `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. These files contain crucial methods related to model instance initialization, foreign key handling, and transaction management. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.__init__` method is relevant for understanding how model instances are initialized and how related objects are set. The `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` method is also crucial as it prepares related fields for saving. In `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey` class and its methods `validate`, `get_attname`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `get_prep_value` are relevant for understanding how foreign key values are handled and validated. These spans provide a comprehensive view of how foreign keys are managed and how related objects are saved, which is essential for addressing the reported issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
