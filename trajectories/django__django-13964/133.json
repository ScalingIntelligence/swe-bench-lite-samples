Specifically, this occurs when the primary key of the related object is set after the relationship has been established. The issue involves the handling of the ForeignKey field and the Deferred fields in Django's ORM. To resolve this, we need to look into how the ForeignKey and Deferred fields are managed in the context of saving related models with non-auto primary keys. We should focus on files that deal with model saving, ForeignKey management, and Deferred fields.",

This includes the initialization of ForeignKey, its handling of related fields, and how it interacts with the database during save operations. Additionally, the handling of primary keys and their values in the Model class, particularly during save operations, may also be relevant. The code spans 'ForeignKey.__init__', 'ForeignKey.get_attname', 'ForeignKey.get_attname_column', 'ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class', 'Model._save_parents', and 'Model._save_table' are thus identified as relevant based on their potential to affect how foreign key relationships and primary keys interact during the save process.",

This is demonstrated in the provided code snippet where an Order instance is being created and assigned a Product instance that has its primary key set after initialization. The issue arises because the foreign key constraint is not properly enforced when the primary key is set after object initialization. To address this issue, we need to review code related to the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes, as well as the Model class's save methods. Given the existing context and search results, we can identify relevant spans of code that handle related fields, foreign key constraints, and model saving logic. By analyzing these sections, we can pinpoint where adjustments might be necessary to ensure that foreign key constraints are correctly applied even when the related object's primary key is set after initial assignment.",

Specifically, it mentions that initializing the relation on the parent with an empty instance and then setting the primary key causes the parent to not 'see' the primary key's change, leading to data loss. This suggests a need to review how foreign key relations, particularly with non-auto CharField primary keys, are handled during the save process.\n\nThe provided file context and search results contain several relevant code spans. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the '__init__' method of the 'Model' class handles initialization of model instances and the populating of fields. The '_save_parents' method is responsible for saving parent models in a hierarchical structure, and '_save_table' handles saving the table data itself. These methods could potentially contain logic related to how foreign keys are managed and saved.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', several code spans relate to the 'ForeignKey' class which defines fields that are foreign keys to other models. The '__init__', 'get_attname', 'get_attname_column', and 'contribute_to_related_class' methods of 'ForeignKey' are particularly relevant as they initialize the foreign key field, define the attribute name for the foreign key, and contribute to the related class, respectively. These methods could contain logic related to how foreign key values are set and managed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans in 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' are likely the most relevant to the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
