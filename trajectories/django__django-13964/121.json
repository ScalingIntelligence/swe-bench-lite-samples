Specifically, when a related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly. However, if the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not 'see' the primary key's change, leading to data loss. From the search results, the relevant code spans are within the '__init__' method of the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py'. This method handles the initialization of model instances and the assignment of field values, including related objects. The '_save_parents' method is also relevant as it deals with saving parent models, which could be related to the issue if the parent model's primary key is not correctly saved before the child model.",

This context provides insight into how Django handles model initialization with keyword arguments and the saving process of related models, which are central to the issue described.

The issue arises when the primary key of the parent object is not correctly propagated to the child object, leading to an unexpected foreign key value ('') in the child object. This issue is relevant to understanding how the foreign key relationship is handled in Django ORM, particularly when assigning unsaved related instances.\n\nThe provided `django/db/models/base.py` file contains the `Model` class, which is central to Django's ORM. Specifically, the `Model.__init__` method initializes instances of models and sets their attributes based on the provided kwargs. The code snippet handling the assignment of related objects (`is_related_object` section) is of particular interest as it deals with assigning related models before they are saved.\n\nThe `Model._save_parents` method is also relevant as it handles the saving of parent objects in a recursive manner, ensuring that related objects are saved correctly. The `Model._save_table` method is responsible for saving the actual table rows for the model instances, taking into account whether the instance is being inserted or updated.\n\nThe `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file contains the `ForeignKey` class, which defines the behavior of foreign key fields in Django. This includes the `ForeignKey.__init__` method for initializing foreign key fields and the `ForeignKey.validate` method, which checks if the referenced object exists, crucial for preventing data integrity issues referred to in the reported issue.\n\nGiven these code spans and their roles in handling model initialization, saving, and foreign key relationships in Django, they are relevant for addressing the reported issue of data loss during parent-child relationship management with non-auto primary keys.",
