Specifically, it seems that the problem arises when the primary key is not set at the time the foreign key relationship is established. The transaction atomicity and how foreign keys are assigned and saved need to be investigated in detail. Focus should be on the methods and classes involved in saving and handling foreign keys, particularly those handling deferred fields and saving related objects. Additionally, the handling of primary keys (especially non-auto primary keys) should be reviewed.",

The '_save_parents' and '_save_table' methods are crucial for understanding the process of saving related objects and ensuring that foreign keys are correctly set. These methods handle the saving of parent objects, the synchronization of link fields between parent and self, and the determination of insert and update operations based on the presence of a primary key.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the 'ForeignKey' class and its methods such as 'validate', 'get_db_prep_save', and 'contribute_to_related_class' are relevant for understanding how foreign key values are validated and prepared for saving. These methods handle the validation of foreign key values, conversion of these values for database storage, and the contribution to the related class, ensuring that the foreign key relation is correctly established.\n\nThese code spans provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles the saving of related models and the management of foreign key relations, particularly in relation to models with non-auto primary keys.

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
