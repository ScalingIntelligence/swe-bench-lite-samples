The problem arises when saving an Order after setting its Product and defining the Product's primary key. The foreign key field in Order (product_id) remains empty instead of being populated with the Product's sku. This needs investigation into the handling of foreign keys and primary keys, especially how the Order.product_id field is handled during assignment and saving. It might be related to how primary keys are processed in Django's model saving and related fields mechanism.",

The problem arises when the parent's primary key is not updated correctly upon saving the child, leading to unexpected behavior such as the parent's foreign key being set to an empty string instead of the child's actual primary key value. To address this, we need to identify code spans that deal with saving parent-child relationships, particularly those involving non-auto primary key fields. In the provided search results, we find several relevant sections in the `django/db/models/base.py` file, such as `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, and `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`, which handle saving instances and related fields. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` contains methods like `get_attname`, `get_attname_column`, and `contribute_to_related_class`, which are closely related to how foreign keys are handled and might be relevant to the issue. These sections are likely to contain the necessary code to understand and potentially fix the issue with saving parent objects after setting child objects with non-numeric primary keys.",
