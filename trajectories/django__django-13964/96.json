Specifically, when a parent object (Order) is saved after setting a child object (Product) with an unsaved instance that later gets its primary key defined, the foreign key in the parent does not reflect the updated primary key of the child. This results in the parent object having an incorrect foreign key value. The search results provided include relevant classes and methods from Django's model fields and base model classes that deal with foreign key relationships, primary keys, and object saving. The `ForeignKey` class and its initialization method `__init__` are particularly relevant as they define the behavior of foreign key fields. Additionally, the `Model` class and its methods `__init__`, `_save_parents`, and `_save_table` are important as they handle how models are initialized and saved, including the handling of related fields. These sections of code are likely where the issue of foreign key not updating correctly when the primary key changes can be addressed.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
