Specifically, there is an issue with the Order model having a ForeignKey to the Product model, where the Product model has a CharField as its primary key. The problem arises when the related Product instance is saved before the Order instance, and the Order instance does not correctly reference the Product's primary key.\n\nAfter examining the code in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, it's clear that the `ForeignKey` class, which extends `ForeignObject`, is relevant to the issue. The `ForeignKey.__init__` method initializes the foreign key relationship and ensures the related field is properly set. This method would logically be part of the solution or mitigation of the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is inspected. The `Model.__init__` method initializes the model instance, setting related objects. The `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods are also relevant as they deal with saving related models and handling the primary keys. These methods may need to be assessed or modified to properly handle instances where the parent model's primary key is non-numeric and not automatically generated.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans are the initialization and saving methods from both `ForeignKey` and `Model` classes, which deal with setting and saving related model instances.",
