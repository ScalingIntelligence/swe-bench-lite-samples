Specifically, it describes a scenario where initializing a foreign key relationship on the parent model with an empty instance that subsequently gets its primary key defined leads to data loss. This suggests a need to investigate the handling of primary keys and foreign key relationships, particularly in the context of deferred fields and the process of saving related models. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in the related.py file, as well as on the Model class in base.py, seems appropriate.",

The issue involves the handling of the foreign key relationship during the save operation, particularly when the related instance is initialized with an empty primary key and later updated. The analysis of the provided code reveals key functions and methods that are crucial to understanding how the foreign key relationships are managed and saved. The Model class's __init__ method handles the initialization of fields, including foreign key relationships, setting attributes based on provided kwargs. The _save_parents and _save_table methods are responsible for saving parent objects and saving the model instance to the database, respectively. These methods handle the synchronization of primary keys and ensure the proper saving of related objects. In the ForeignKey class within related.py, the __init__ and contribute_to_related_class methods are particularly relevant as they set up the foreign key relationship and contribute to the related class's attributes, ensuring the relationship is properly defined.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
