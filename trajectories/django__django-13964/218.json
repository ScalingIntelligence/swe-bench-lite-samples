The problem arises when the primary key is set after the instance is assigned to the parent model, leading to data loss. The first step is to investigate how Django handles foreign key relationships in general and specifically when the related model has a non-auto primary key. Looking at the provided context, there are several key files related to model handling, field definitions, and serialization that could contain relevant code. Focusing initially on the ForeignKey class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and related methods such as 'contribute_to_related_class' and 'get_db_prep_save' should help understand how Django initializes and saves related model instances, including handling of primary keys.",

The issue occurs when the primary key is set after initialization, leading to incorrect foreign key assignment ('') on the child. This suggests a problem with how the ForeignKey field handles updates when the related object's primary key changes after initialization. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are those that deal with the ForeignKey class and its interactions with related objects, particularly during the initialization and saving processes. These include the ForeignKey and ForeignObject classes, their initialization methods (__init__), and methods related to saving objects (_save_parents and _save_table).

            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyzing the reported issue: The issue pertains to a data loss scenario when saving a parent object after setting it on a child object, specifically when the parent model has a non-numeric primary key. There is a focus on ensuring that the foreign key relation between the 'Order' and 'Product' models updates correctly when the primary key (sku) of the 'Product' is set after initialization. 2. Reviewing Current Context: The current context provides insights into Django's related fields, specifically the ForeignKey and ForeignObject classes. These classes handle the mechanics of foreign key relationships in Django models, which are central to the issue reported. 3. Processing New Search Results: The new search results include further details on the ForeignKey class, particularly how it handles the initialization and saving of related instances. This includes the methods `__init__`, `get_attname`, `get_attname_column`, `get_default`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `get_prep_value`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the foreign key values are managed and saved in the database. Additionally, the Model class is also detailed, focusing on the `__init__`, `save_base`, `_save_parents`, and `_save_table` methods, which are central to the lifecycle of Django model instances and their persistence in the database. Finally, the Field class is discussed, particularly the `_check_null_allowed_for_primary_keys` method, which is relevant to ensuring that primary keys do not allow null values. This directly relates to the issue, as it is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the primary key, especially when dealing with non-numeric keys. 4. Identifying Relevant Code Spans: Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans include: ForeignKey's `__init__` and `get_db_prep_save`, Model's `__init__` and `_save_table`, and Field's `_check_null_allowed_for_primary_keys`. These spans are selected because they provide a comprehensive understanding of how the foreign key relationships are initiated, how the associated primary keys are managed and validated, and how the model instances are saved in the database. This information is crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the data loss issue reported.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
