The scenario involves saving a parent object after setting a foreign key relationship on a child object, which leads to data loss if the primary key is not explicitly set or updated correctly. Critical areas to investigate include the methods and logic in the Model class for saving parents and tables, the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes, and how related fields are handled in the context of saving and assignment. To address this, we should focus on the specific methods and logic that deal with saving models, handling foreign key assignments, and ensuring the integrity of related fields. We will perform a detailed search on the Model, ForeignKey, and OneToOneField classes and their associated methods.",

The issue specifically occurs when the primary key of the related child object is set after it has been assigned to the parent object. This discrepancy arises due to the handling of the foreign key assignment and the timing of saving the objects. The search results include relevant code spans from Django's model classes, particularly focusing on how the primary key and foreign key relationships are managed. The spans involve 'Model.save', 'Model.save_base', 'Model._save_parents', 'Model._save_table', 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save', and 'ForeignKey' class methods. These spans are crucial for understanding how changes to primary keys and foreign key assignments are processed and saved in the database. By examining these code spans, we can identify the potential areas where the handling of non-auto primary keys and foreign key assignments could be improved to prevent data loss scenarios as described in the issue.",

The code snippets provided include parts of the `Model` class, `ForeignKey` class, and the `Field` class. These components are directly relevant to the problem described. The `Model` class contains methods for saving objects and handling related fields, which is a critical part of the issue. The `ForeignKey` class is directly involved in defining how foreign key relationships work in Django models, and it includes checks and validation processes that could relate to the data loss problem when dealing with non-auto primary keys. Lastly, the `Field` class, from which `ForeignKey` inherits, includes core functionalities shared across different types of fields. Given the in-depth nature of the issue and the scope of Django's codebase, the provided context seems sufficient to understand the core mechanics that could lead to the data loss issue and how to address it. However, detailed testing of the suggested solutions would need to be conducted in a real-world scenario to ensure all potential edge cases are addressed.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
