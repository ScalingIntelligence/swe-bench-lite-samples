Specifically, it involves understanding how foreign keys are handled when the primary key is a CharField and not an auto-incrementing field. The main concern is that if the related unsaved instance (Product) is initialized without its primary key and later assigned to the parent (Order), the foreign key constraint might not be enforced correctly. This can lead to data inconsistencies and loss. The primary focus should be on the 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' files, as these are likely where the core logic for saving models and handling related fields resides.",

It specifically mentions problems when the primary key is not auto-generated and is a CharField. The issue seems to stem from how the foreign key relationship is handled when the related instance is assigned but not yet saved, and then the primary key of the related instance is set and saved. This can lead to the foreign key field being set to an empty string, causing the assertion to fail. From the search results, the relevant code spans seem to be those that deal with the initialization and saving of model instances. 'Model.__init__' deals with the initialization of model instances and their attributes. 'Model._save_parents' and 'Model._save_table' are relevant as they handle the saving process of model instances and their related parents. 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' is also relevant as it prepares related fields before saving them, which could potentially handle the issue of unsaved related objects. These code spans appear to be relevant to the reported issue, as they deal with the primary key handling, the saving process, and the related fields in Django models.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
