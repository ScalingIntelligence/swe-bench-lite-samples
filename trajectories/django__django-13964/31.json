Specifically, it seems to miss detecting changes to the primary key when the related instance is saved before assignment. This suggests a need to examine how Django handles primary key assignment and changes in related models, particularly in the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes. The focus should be on methods that manage saving related objects and handling primary keys during these operations.",

When the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not 'see' the primary key's change, leading to data loss.\n\nThe search results include code related to the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes, which are relevant to the issue described. The ForeignKey class is responsible for handling foreign key relations, and the OneToOneField class inherits from ForeignKey and is designed for one-to-one relationships. The code spans cover initialization, target field handling, and database preparation functions, which could all be related to the issue described.\n\nSpecifically, the code spans 'ForeignKey.__init__', 'ForeignKey.target_field', 'ForeignKey.get_attname', 'ForeignKey.get_attname_column', 'ForeignKey.get_default', 'ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save', 'ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value', 'ForeignKey.get_prep_value', and 'ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class' are relevant as they involve handling of foreign key attributes, database interactions, and contributing to related classes. Additionally, the OneToOneField class spans are also relevant as they provide insight into how one-to-one relationships are managed in Django.\n\nBased on the code spans provided, it appears that the search results cover the necessary areas of the codebase that would be relevant to addressing the reported issue. Thus, the search task can be considered complete.",
