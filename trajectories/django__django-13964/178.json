The issue specifically arises when the related foreign key is set with an empty instance of the parent model and the primary key is subsequently defined. This leads to the parent object not seeing the primary key's change and thus resulting in data loss.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the initialization, saving, and updating of model instances, especially concerning the handling of primary keys and foreign keys. The search results provide several key spans that are potentially relevant:\n\n1. `Model.__init__` in `django/db/models/base.py`: This method initializes the model instance and sets attributes based on the provided arguments. This could be crucial for understanding how the `product_id` is initially set.\n2. `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` in `django/db/models/base.py`: These methods handle the saving of parent objects and their tables, which is relevant to the issue of foreign key handling and data validation.\n3. `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value` and `ForeignKey.get_prep_value` in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: These methods handle the preparation of foreign key values for database insertion or update, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n4. `CASCADE` in `django/db/models/deletion.py`: This function handles cascading deletions and could be relevant if the issue involves relations being incorrectly deleted or set to null.\n\nGiven these spans, the identified relevant code spans focus on the initialization, saving, and foreign key handling within the Django ORM. These sections are likely to contain the logic that could either cause or resolve the data loss issue described.",
