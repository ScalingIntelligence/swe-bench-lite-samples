This seems to be related to how Django handles saving related fields, particularly ForeignKey fields. The problem is that the primary key of the related instance is not properly propagated during the save process, leading to potential data inconsistencies. To address this, we need to locate the relevant parts of Django's ORM code where related field handling is implemented, especially focusing on methods like _save_parents, _save_table, and _prepare_related_fields_for_save in the Model class, as well as the ForeignKey class within related fields handling.",
