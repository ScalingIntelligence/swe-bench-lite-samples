Specifically, it seems the problem lies in how foreign key values are managed when saving related instances. To investigate this, we should focus on the sections of Django's code that deal with saving related objects, particularly in the `base.py` and `related.py` files where model saving and foreign key implementations are defined. Additionally, checking how primary keys are handled in the `fields/__init__.py` file might provide insights into the problem, especially focusing on the `ForeignKey` class and its interactions with non-numeric primary keys.",

The file context provided gives insights into the `Model` class's `__init__`, `save`, `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, and `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` methods in `base.py`, and the `ForeignKey` class in `related.py`. These sections of the code are crucial as they manage the instantiation, saving, and relationship handling of model instances. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class's methods like `get_attname`, `get_default`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `get_prep_value` are relevant for understanding how foreign key values are processed and stored. Overall, the provided file context seems to cover the core functionalities needed to understand and potentially address the issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
