The problem arises when the primary key is set after initializing a related instance on the parent object. To debug this, we need to focus on the methods responsible for saving related objects and handling foreign key relationships. Class names like 'ForeignKey', 'Deferred', and 'QuerySet' should be particularly relevant, as well as function names like '_save_parents', '_save_table', and 'get_db_prep_value'. We should also search for patterns where foreign key values are prepared or checked before saving to identify whether the non-auto primary key's changes are correctly reflected in the related object's fields.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it seems to revolve around the behavior of ForeignKey fields when the related model has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The issue arises when trying to save a parent object after setting a child object that hasn't had its primary key defined yet. This leads to data inconsistency because the parent object's foreign key field is not properly updated to reflect the child object's primary key once it's defined. \n\nReviewing the search results, I notice several relevant sections. The `RelatedField` class might be a good place to start as it is a base class for fields that have relationships to other models. The `ForeignObject` class is also relevant, particularly where it subclasses `RelatedField`. This class is the base class for fields that define relationships like foreign keys. The `ForeignKey` class implementation has methods that directly deal with how foreign keys are managed, including `__init__` and `get_db_prep_value`. These are key to understanding how the foreign key is handled and could potentially hold the root cause of the issue, or provide insights into where a fix might be applied. Therefore, I believe it's necessary to carefully inspect the code in these specific spans to fully understand and propose a solution to the reported issue.",

The key aspects of the issue involve how the primary key is managed when related objects are saved and how foreign keys are updated accordingly. From the provided file context and search results, it's evident that the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` contains critical code for defining and managing foreign key relationships, including the `ForeignKey` class and its methods like `__init__` and `get_db_prep_value`. The `django/db/models/base.py` also contains relevant code for model instance creation and saving, particularly the `Model.__init__` and `Model.save_base` methods, which handle the initialization and saving process, including the handling of related objects. These sections of code are directly relevant to the issue as they involve the logic for setting and updating foreign keys and saving model instances. The `django/db/backends/base/base.py` provides the base implementation for database connections and transaction management, which, while important for context, is less directly related to the specifics of the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
