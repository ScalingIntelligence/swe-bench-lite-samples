Specifically, when initializing the relation with an empty instance of the related model and subsequently defining its primary key, the parent model does not correctly update its foreign key value, leading to potential data loss. \n\nThe provided search results contain several key sections of Django's codebase that are relevant to this issue. They include the ForeignKey class definition in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and the Model class methods in 'django/db/models/base.py'. \n\nThe ForeignKey class includes methods like 'get_attname', 'get_attname_column', 'get_default', 'get_db_prep_save', 'get_db_prep_value', and 'get_prep_value', which are crucial for handling the assignment and retrieval of foreign key values. These methods could be where the issue arises when dealing with non-auto primary keys.\n\nIn the 'django/db/models/base.py' file, the Model class contains the '__init__', '_save_parents', '_save_table', and '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' methods. These methods handle the initialization, saving, and preparation of related fields for save operations. The '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' method in particular is of interest as it ensures that related objects have been saved before setting their primary keys. This could be a potential point of failure or correction for the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem described in the issue, these sections of code are directly related to the handling of foreign key relations and the saving of parent objects. They should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue.",

The imports are correctly set up, and the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method has been updated to handle non-auto CharField primary keys properly. The lint error has been resolved by importing the 'models' module. The issue has been fully addressed, and the task is complete.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
