The issue arises when the primary key of the parent is not correctly propagated to the child's foreign key field. The provided search results include sections of code from Django's ORM that deal with model initialization, saving, and handling foreign keys. These sections might be relevant to the issue. Specifically, the code spans related to the `Model.__init__`, `Model.save_base`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, and `ForeignKey` class are likely candidates for investigation, as they handle model instantiation, saving processes, and foreign key relations.\n\n1. **Model.__init__**: This method initializes the model instance and sets attributes based on constructor arguments. It might be relevant to see how foreign key relations are initialized.\n2. **Model.save_base**: Responsible for saving the model instance to the database, including handling transactions and atomicity.\n3. **Model._save_parents** and **Model._save_table**: These methods handle the saving of related parent models and the model's own table respectively, which could be where the foreign key relationship is managed or mismanaged leading to the issue.\n4. **ForeignKey**: This class defines the behavior of foreign key fields and includes methods like `get_attname`, `get_db_prep_save`, and `get_prep_value`, which might influence how foreign key values are processed and saved.\n\nGiven these potential points of interest, further analysis of these code spans should help determine if they indeed contribute to the reported issue.",
