The problem occurs when the parent object is saved after setting the relation on the child, resulting in data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys. There are several areas of concern including how the foreign key relation is handled at assignment, the saving of parent models, and the behavior of deferred fields. We need to search for the relevant code in the Model, ForeignKey, and related classes, focusing on their save and assignment methods. Additionally, we should look into the handling of primary keys to understand how they are handled differently from auto-increment keys.",

The issue highlights two scenarios: one where the primary key is assigned after initialization and another where it's assigned before. The key parts of the codebase related to this issue are found in the `Model` class methods such as `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, and `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` in `django/db/models/base.py`, and in the `ForeignKey` class methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, specifically focusing on how foreign keys are handled, particularly `ForeignKey._check_unique`, `ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields`, and `ForeignKey.get_attname`.\n\nI identified these spans as relevant because they deal directly with the saving and handling of parent-child relationships in Django models, particularly when the primary key is a non-auto CharField. The `_save_parents` and `_save_table` methods are crucial for understanding how parent objects are saved and how primary keys are handled during save operations. The `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method is also relevant as it prepares related fields for save operations, which might help in understanding how foreign keys are managed in relation to unsaved objects. In `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey` class methods detail how foreign keys are checked for uniqueness, resolved, and how their attributes are retrieved, which are critical for understanding how foreign keys relate to the primary key values of other models.",
