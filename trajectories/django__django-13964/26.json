            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a problem with saving parent objects after setting on child objects when the parent has a non-numeric primary key. This issue is concerned with the behavior of foreign key relationships in Django models, specifically when the related model has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. Several key areas in the provided codebase are relevant to understanding and addressing this issue. The first file 'django/db/models/base.py' contains important methods of the Model class that are instrumental in object initialization, primary key handling, and saving operations. The methods '_init__', '_get_pk_val', '_set_pk_val', '_save_table', and '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' are particularly relevant as they deal directly with model initialization, primary key retrieval and setting, and save operations, which are central to the issue at hand. These methods control how fields, including foreign keys, are handled in relation to the model's primary key and how changes are persisted to the database. The second file 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' contains the implementation of the ForeignKey field, specifically the 'get_db_prep_value' method, which is responsible for preparing values for database insertion, relevant to how foreign key values are managed. The third file 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' contains the base Field class and its methods such as 'get_filter_kwargs_for_object', 'pre_save', 'get_prep_value', etc., which are crucial for understanding field-level operations during model saving and initialization. These methods are significant for the integrity of data between models with foreign key relations. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to the issue as they directly pertain to the management and persistence of model data with respect to primary key and foreign key relationships.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
