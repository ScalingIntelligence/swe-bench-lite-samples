The issue arises when a related object is initialized with an empty primary key and then later assigned a value, leading to the foreign key not being updated correctly. The search results provide several code spans that are relevant to this issue, particularly in the handling of foreign keys in the Django models. The 'ForeignKey.validate' method checks the existence of the related object before saving, which is closely related to the issue described. Additionally, the 'ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class' method ensures that the related field name is correctly set, which is also relevant. The 'Model._save_table' method is involved in the actual saving process and could potentially be related to the issue if the foreign key value is not updated correctly during this process. The 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' method is also relevant as it prepares related fields for saving, which could be where the problem occurs when handling non-numeric primary keys. Overall, these code spans provide a good basis to understand and potentially fix the issue reported.",
