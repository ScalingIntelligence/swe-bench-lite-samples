Specifically, when initializing the foreign key on the parent with an empty instance and subsequently defining the primary key, the parent model fails to recognize the change. This leads to data loss as the foreign key is not correctly populated. The search should focus on the handling of primary keys and foreign key relations within the Django ORM, particularly in the `ForeignKey` and `Model` classes within `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. Additionally, attention should be given to the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` and `_save_table` methods in the `Model` class, as these are key to understanding how related fields are saved and handled.",

From the search results, the files 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py' contain relevant code spans that deal with these issues. The 'ForeignKey' class in 'related.py' and the 'Model' class in 'base.py' are particularly relevant as they handle the initialization, assignment, and saving of related fields and model instances respectively. The 'ForeignKey.__init__', 'ForeignKey.get_attname', 'ForeignKey.get_attname_column', and 'ForeignKey.get_default' methods in 'related.py' are likely involved in how foreign key values are handled and assigned. In 'base.py', the 'Model.save', 'Model._save_parents', and 'Model._save_table' methods are crucial as they control the saving of model instances and their related fields.

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
