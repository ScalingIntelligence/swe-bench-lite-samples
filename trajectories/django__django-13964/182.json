Specifically, if the primary key is not defined at the time of assignment and is subsequently defined before saving, the foreign key is not updated to reflect the correct primary key value. This leads to data inconsistencies. The search should focus on the Django model handling and specifically the handling of foreign key relationships and primary keys.",

The issue is that if the foreign key relation is initialized with an empty instance and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent object does not register the change of the primary key, leading to potential data loss. The search results contain relevant code spans that handle model preparation for saving, foreign key handling, and primary key management. Particularly, the method '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' in 'django/db/models/base.py' seems to manage related field preparation for save operations, which could be critical in addressing the issue described. Also, the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' is relevant as it likely deals with the foreign key setup and management. These sections of code should be analyzed closely to understand how the primary key assignment and foreign key relation are handled during the save process.",

The provided code segments handle the initialization, assignment, and saving processes of related models, including checks for related objects and their primary keys. This context is sufficient to understand the mechanisms that might lead to the described issue. The provided code does not directly address the issue with deferring foreign key constraints until transaction commit, but it covers the core operations relevant to the issue.

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
