This is relevant to the `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods in `django/db/models/base.py`, as these methods handle the saving of parent models and the management of primary keys. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is pertinent, as it defines the behavior of foreign key fields, which are central to the issue's context. Specifically, the `ForeignKey.__init__` and `ForeignKey.validate` methods are of interest, as they set up the foreign key relationship and validate the related object, respectively. The `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` method is also relevant as it prepares related fields for saving, which could impact how the primary key is handled in this scenario.\n\nThe identified code spans are crucial for understanding the mechanisms involved in saving related models and the handling of foreign key relationships. The `Model._save_parents` method is particularly important for the issue, as it deals with saving parents and setting primary keys. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class and its methods help understand the setup and validation of foreign key relationships, which are directly related to the issue. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles related models and foreign key fields, which is necessary for addressing the reported issue of data loss due to primary key handling in parent-child relationships.",
