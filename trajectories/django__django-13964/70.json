After analyzing the search results, the identified spans focus on the Model's initialization (__init__), saving (save, save_base, _save_parents, _save_table), and handling of related fields (_prepare_related_fields_for_save).

These methods handle the saving of objects and the preparation of related fields before save, which could affect the handling of foreign keys and primary keys, especially those that are non-auto. Given this, and considering the specific error related to non-iterable NoneType objects when dealing with primary keys, it's crucial to deeply explore these methods and how they interact with transactions and constraint checking. This includes examining how primary key values are assigned, especially when dealing with unsaved related objects, and how constraints are enforced at the transaction level.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
