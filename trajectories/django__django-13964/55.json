The problem occurs when the primary key of the parent instance is set after the instance is assigned to the child. This leads to data loss as the foreign key in the child instance is not updated correctly. The focus should be on the `Model` class methods related to saving and updating fields, especially those handling related objects and deferred fields. Similarly, the `ForeignKey` class methods should be reviewed, particularly those involved in field validation, preparation for database save, and contributing to related classes.",

The issue arises when the primary key of the related parent model is not properly set or recognized by the child model during the save process.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, the focus should be on the ForeignKey field handling and the Model class's save and initialization logic. The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` files. These spans include the `Model.__init__`, `Model.save_base`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`, `ForeignKey.validate`, and other related methods. These methods are critical for understanding how the foreign key relationship is handled during the initialization and saving of model instances.\n\nSpecifically, the `Model.__init__` method initializes the model instance, setting attributes based on the provided arguments or defaults. The `Model.save_base` and related methods handle the actual saving process, including saving related objects and handling the primary key values. The `ForeignKey.validate` method ensures the foreign key value is valid and exists in the related model.\n\nThese code spans collectively provide insight into how Django handles model initialization, foreign key relationships, and the saving process, which are directly related to the reported issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
