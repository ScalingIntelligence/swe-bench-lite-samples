The issue arises because the foreign key field in the parent object does not update correctly when the primary key of the related object is set after initialization.\n\nTo address this, the relevant code spans should include methods and properties related to getting and setting primary keys, handling foreign key relations, and managing object saving in Django models. The search results provide several relevant code spans, including:\n\n1. `Model._get_pk_val` and `Model._set_pk_val`: These methods handle getting and setting the primary key value of a model instance.\n2. `Model.save`: This method is responsible for saving the model instance to the database and includes logic for handling related fields and deferred fields.\n3. `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table`: These methods handle saving parent models and updating tables, respectively.\n4. `ForeignKey.get_attname`, `ForeignKey.get_attname_column`, `ForeignKey.get_default`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value`, `ForeignKey.get_prep_value`, and `ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class`: These methods are related to the `ForeignKey` field and handle various aspects of its behavior.\n\nThese code spans are relevant to the reported issue because they cover the necessary parts of Django's model handling and foreign key relations that would need to be inspected or potentially modified to resolve the issue of data loss with non-numeric primary keys.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
