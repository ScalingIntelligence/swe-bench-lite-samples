The primary key issue arises when initializing a parent object with an empty related instance and then setting the primary key on the related instance.

The search should focus on the '_save_parents', '_save_table', '_prepare_related_fields_for_save', 'ForeignKey', and 'OneToOneField' methods and classes, as they are pivotal in managing related objects and foreign keys.",

Specifically, when initializing and saving a model with a foreign key relation, the primary key's change might not be correctly propagated to the parent model, leading to potential data loss or integrity issues. To address this, examining the Django model code and related foreign key handling is crucial. From the provided code snippets, several key methods stand out as relevant:\n\n1. **Model.__init__**: This method initializes the model instance, setting attributes and dealing with related objects. It's important for how foreign keys are initially set up.\n2. **Model._save_parents**: This method handles saving parent models in a hierarchy. It's relevant because issues could arise if the primary key changes before or after saving the parent.\n3. **Model._save_table**: This method handles the actual saving of model instances to the database. It's critical for understanding how primary keys are managed during the save process.\n4. **ForeignKey.get_attname**, **ForeignKey.get_attname_column**, and **ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class**: These methods are part of the ForeignKey class and deal with attribute naming and related class contributions. They are relevant for how foreign keys are named and how they interact with related models.\n\nThese methods and classes are initial candidates for inspection based on the reported issue. Further analysis is needed within these spans to pinpoint the exact cause and potential fixes or adjustments needed to handle non-numeric primary keys correctly in foreign key relations.",
