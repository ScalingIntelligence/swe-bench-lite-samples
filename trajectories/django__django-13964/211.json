The issue is that when a related object is initialized with an empty instance and later assigned a primary key, the parent object does not recognize the change, leading to data loss. This can be related to how Django handles the initialization and saving of model instances, especially with foreign keys having non-auto primary keys. The search results provide relevant code spans that handle model initialization, saving, and foreign key relationships in Django's models. Specifically, the code spans related to `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, and `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` are closely related to the issue. Additionally, the spans from `ForeignKey` and its initialization process in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are also relevant as they deal with the foreign key relationship itself. These code spans provide insights into how Django handles foreign keys and model saving, which are crucial for addressing the reported issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
