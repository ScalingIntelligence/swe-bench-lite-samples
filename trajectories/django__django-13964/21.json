The main concern is that the foreign key field (product_id in the Order model) is not being correctly updated with the primary key of the related Product instance. This leads to data loss as the Order instance ends up with an incorrect or empty product_id. The issue seems to be centered around how the ForeignKey field handles the assignment and saving of related instances, especially when the primary key is a non-auto CharField. Potential areas to investigate include the ForeignKey class in django/db/models/fields/related.py and Model class methods responsible for saving related objects and handling deferred fields in django/db/models/base.py.",

This typically happens when the primary key is defined after the relationship is initialized on the parent object. The issue highlights the need to examine how foreign key relationships are handled in Django's model saving mechanism, particularly with non-auto primary keys. By analyzing the code spans provided in 'django/db/models/base.py', we can see several key areas that might be relevant to this issue: the initialization of the Model class, the handling of related fields during save operations, and the way primary keys are managed and updated. Specifically, the methods 'Model.__init__', 'Model._save_parents', 'Model._save_table', and 'Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save' appear to be directly involved with managing object initialization, saving related objects, and preparing related fields for save operations, all of which could impact how foreign key relationships with non-numeric primary keys are handled. These methods are thus identified as relevant spans of code to investigate further and potentially modify to address the reported issue.",

The _prepare_related_fields_for_save method also touches on aspects related to ensuring related fields are correctly handled before saving. Although the file context does not contain the entire codebase and specific parts like ForeignKey class handling (located in django/db/models/fields/related.py) are not included, the parts provided seem sufficient to understand and address the issue reported.

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
