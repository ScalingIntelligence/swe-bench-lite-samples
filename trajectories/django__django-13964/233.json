The problem arises when the primary key is set after initializing the related object, leading to data loss as the primary key change is not reflected in the parent object. This suggests an investigation into how Django handles primary keys and foreign key relations, particularly when the primary key is manually set post-initialization. Specific areas to focus on include the models' base handling, fields related to primary keys and foreign keys, and how fields' values are prepared for saving.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
