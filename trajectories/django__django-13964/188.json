The key elements in the issue are the foreign key relation, handling of primary keys (specifically non-auto CharField), and the order of operations in saving related objects. The provided search results contain several relevant sections of code from Django's Model class and ForeignKey field implementation. The relevant code spans include how Model instances are initialized (__init__), how primary keys are handled (_get_pk_val and _set_pk_val), and how related fields are prepared for save (_prepare_related_fields_for_save). Additionally, the ForeignKey class's initialization and how it handles related fields are pertinent. These sections provide insight into how Django handles foreign key relationships and primary key assignments, which is crucial for understanding and addressing the reported issue.",
