This leads to data loss, as the parent object's primary key changes are not reflected in the child's foreign key field. To address this, we need to explore how Django handles the saving and updating of related objects, particularly focusing on foreign key relationships and how changes in primary keys are managed. We should look into the `Model` class methods related to saving, especially `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, and `_prepare_related_fields_for_save`. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `related.py` and the `Field` class in `__init__.py` should be examined to understand how foreign key values are assigned and validated during save operations.",

This issue is related to how Django handles saving of models with foreign key relationships and the assignment of primary keys. The relevant sections of code from the search results that are particularly pertinent include the handling of primary key values in `Model._get_pk_val` and `Model._set_pk_val`, the saving process in `Model.save` and `Model.save_base`, and the preparation of related fields for save in `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is crucial as it defines how foreign keys are managed, including methods like `resolve_related_fields`, `get_attname`, and `contribute_to_related_class`. These sections efficiently address the core of the issue by detailing how primary keys and foreign keys are handled, saved, and related fields are prepared for saving, which directly relate to the problem described in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Charlie DeTar)\n\t \nGiven a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\tsku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)\nclass Order(models.Model):\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\nIf the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not \"see\" the primary key's change:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product()\n\torder.product.sku = \"foo\"\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product_id=\"\").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails\nInstead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
