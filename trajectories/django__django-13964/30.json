Specifically, the problem arises when assigning a related instance without a primary key to a parent object, and then subsequently defining the primary key. When the transaction is committed, the foreign key in the parent object is not updated with the correct primary key of the related instance, leading to data loss or invalid states. This issue seems to be related to how Django's ORM handles the assignment and saving of fields with non-auto primary keys. The relevant files identified from the context share common concerns with model field handling, particularly in the base, related fields, and the query functionalities.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
