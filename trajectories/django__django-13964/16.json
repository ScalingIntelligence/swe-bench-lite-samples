The problem arises when the child instance is saved before the parent, leading to data loss or incorrect FK assignments. To resolve this, we need to look into how the fields are handled during assignment, particularly focusing on how auto vs non-auto primary keys are processed, and how FKs are set and updated. Given the context, we should search in files handling model base, related fields, and field initializations.",

The key elements identified in the issue are the handling of foreign key relations, particularly when the related object's primary key is a non-auto CharField. The analysis of the search results reveals relevant code spans that address these concerns. The `Model._get_pk_val` and `Model._set_pk_val` methods manage the primary key value of the model instances. The `ForeignKey` class's methods such as `get_attname`, `get_attname_column`, `get_default`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, `get_prep_value`, and `contribute_to_related_class` handle various aspects of managing foreign key relationships, including the assignment and handling of primary keys. These code spans are relevant as they directly deal with the primary key and foreign key management issues described in the reported issue. Additionally, the `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods are crucial as they manage the saving process of parent objects, which is central to the issue at hand.",
