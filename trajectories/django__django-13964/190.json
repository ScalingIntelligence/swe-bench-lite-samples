The `__init__` method is of particular interest as it deals with setting attributes based on provided arguments and keyword arguments, potentially handling how foreign keys are assigned and managed.

The main focus is on how the foreign key (product_id) in the Order model is handled when the related Product model instance is saved. The `Model.__init__` method and `Model._save_parents` method in the codebase are particularly relevant as they handle the initialization and saving of related objects respectively.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the `Model.__init__` method is found to set attributes of the model's related fields, including handling whether the field is a related object. This method checks if the passed field is a related object and sets it accordingly. This is directly related to creating and setting the relation between the Order and Product models as per the issue description.\n\nThe `Model._save_table` method is also relevant as it manages saving the model data to the database, including handling primary keys and whether an insert or update operation is required. This method's handling of primary key values, including conditions around whether updates are forced or primary keys are already set, presents a likely location to troubleshoot or adjust behavior related to the issue's scenario where the parent's primary key (non-auto) is not correctly set in the child model's foreign key field after being updated.\n\nThus, both `Model.__init__` in handling the setting of related objects and `Model._save_table` in managing save operations could be involved in the problem's root cause or offer potential solutions, indicating sufficient relevance to the reported issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
