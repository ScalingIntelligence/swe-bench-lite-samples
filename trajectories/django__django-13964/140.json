Specifically, when a related instance is initialized and assigned to a parent object with an empty primary key, and then the primary key is defined and saved, the changes are not reflected properly in the parent object. This seems to be related to how the primary key is handled during the save process and how the foreign key is updated. To investigate this, we should focus on the areas where model saving, foreign key handling, and primary key management are implemented. This includes the Model class and its related methods, ForeignKey and ForeignObject classes, and related descriptors.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported involves a data loss scenario when saving a parent object after setting a foreign key relation on a child object with a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The key steps involve initializing the related instance on the parent without specifying its primary key, saving the related instance, and then saving the parent. The problem arises when the foreign key value is not updated correctly, leading to an empty string being set as the foreign key value, which does not exist in the related table. The search results contain relevant code spans that can help address this issue:\n1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model._save_parents` method checks and synchronizes parent and self fields related to foreign keys before saving, which could be relevant.\n2. The `Model._save_table` method also checks the primary key value and updates it if necessary, which might handle the correct propagation of the primary key value.\n3. In `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, the `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save` method and other related methods like `get_db_prep_value` and `get_prep_value` handle the preparation of the value before saving to the database, which could be crucial for correctly handling the foreign key value.\n4. The `ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class` method helps in setting the correct field name for the related class, which might impact how the foreign key values are interpreted and saved.\nConsidering the above, these code spans are likely relevant to the issue, especially those dealing with saving related objects and preparing foreign key values for saving in the database.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
