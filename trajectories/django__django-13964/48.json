This problem is evident in the scenarios described where the foreign key relation between 'Order' and 'Product' does not handle correctly when the 'Product' instance is saved after being assigned to 'Order', especially when the 'sku' attribute (primary key of 'Product') is set after the initial assignment. From the search results, there are several critical sections in the code that handle model initialization, saving parents, and the saving of tables with relation to primary keys and foreign keys. The 'Model.__init__' method is responsible for initializing instances of the model, where it handles the assignment of related objects. The '_save_parents' method is crucial as it recursively saves parent models and sets foreign keys. The '_save_table' method is also significant in managing how tables are saved with checks on primary key values and conditions for force_insert or force_update. These sections are likely to contain the root cause of the data loss issue described, particularly where handling of the foreign key and its related primary key values occur in these methods.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
