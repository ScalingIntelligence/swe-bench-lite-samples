Specifically, there seems to be an issue when saving parent objects after setting foreign key relationships on child objects where the primary key is not automatically generated. The focus should be on the methods and classes responsible for saving models, handling foreign key relationships, and managing primary keys. Given the context, it's important to search for methods and classes involved in these processes within the Django ORM and model definition files.",

Specifically, the `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, and `Model._save_table` methods in `base.py` handle the initialization and saving of model instances, including the handling of related objects.
