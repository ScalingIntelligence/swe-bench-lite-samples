This results in the foreign key field on the parent not being updated correctly. The search should focus on the `ForeignKey` class and its methods as well as the `Model` class methods that handle saving related fields. Additionally, we should look for any methods or logic in the `ForeignKey` class related to handling primary key assignment.",

This leads to data loss as the child does not correctly reflect the primary key changes in the parent. The provided code snippets from `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are crucial for understanding the mechanism of model instantiation and the handling of foreign keys. Key elements to focus on include the `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, and `Model._save_table` methods in `base.py`, as well as the `ForeignKey` class and its methods in `related.py`. These methods manage the setting and saving of attributes, including foreign keys, and ensure data integrity. The reported issue seems to stem from how the `Order.product_id` field is handled upon assignment and saving, particularly with respect to non-auto primary keys. The relevant code spans include the handling of related objects in `Model.__init__` and the preparation for saving related fields in `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`, as well as the `ForeignKey` class methods that manage the database preparation for saving foreign key values.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
