The problem arises when assigning an unsaved related model instance to a parent model, and subsequently saving them. The foreign key field in the parent model does not correctly update to reflect the primary key of the saved related instance. This can lead to data loss or transaction failures. To address this, we need to focus on the fields and methods involved in handling foreign keys, saving instances, and managing related fields. We should search for the class and methods in the provided files that are responsible for handling these operations.",

The issue arises when the foreign key field (Order.product_id) is not correctly populated with the child's primary key (Product.sku). This is likely due to the parent object not recognizing the primary key change in the child object after it has been saved. The provided code spans include methods from the `Model` class in Django's models base file, specifically handling the saving of objects and the management of primary keys. Relevant spans include `Model.save`, `Model.save_base`, `Model._save_parents`, and `Model._save_table`, which deal with saving objects and handling primary keys. These methods are crucial for understanding how the foreign key relation is managed and how primary keys are handled during save operations. The issue may be related to how the foreign key value is set or updated during the save process, particularly in `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`. These code spans provide a foundation for further investigation into how Django handles foreign key relations and primary key updates during model saving.",

These methods handle the logic for saving related objects, managing primary keys, and enforcing constraints, which are key to resolving the reported issue. Specifically, the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method is crucial as it ensures related fields are properly prepared before saving, which could handle scenarios where unsaved related instances are assigned to parent objects. The methods dealing with saving and updating instances, such as `_save_table`, also play a critical role in how foreign keys are managed and updated, which is directly related to the issue of data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys.
