The primary key is initially empty but gets updated later, yet the parent object doesn't reflect this change. To address this, we should focus on the methods and classes that handle model instance saving, especially those related to saving related fields and handling foreign keys. The provided code snippets suggest several key points of interest: the Model class's _save_table method, ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in the related.py file, and the Field class's handling of primary keys. We should search for these specific functionalities to understand how primary keys and foreign keys are managed during save operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around saving a parent object after setting it on a child, which leads to data loss if the parent has a non-numeric primary key. The key points from the reported issue include:\n1. The `Product` model has a `CharField` as its primary key.\n2. The `Order` model has a foreign key relation to `Product`.\n3. When the primary key of the `Product` instance is not set at the time of assignment to the `Order`, the foreign key in `Order` is incorrectly set to an empty string, leading to data loss.\n4. The issue is related to how Django handles foreign key assignment and the primary key values in this scenario.\n\nGiven these points, the relevant code spans should focus on the handling of primary key values and foreign key assignments in the Django ORM.\n\nIn the provided search results, several spans in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are relevant:\n\n1. `Model._get_pk_val`, `Model._set_pk_val`, and the `pk` property in `django/db/models/base.py` are directly involved in managing primary key values.\n2. `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` in `django/db/models/base.py` are relevant as they deal with saving related objects and tables, likely where the actual saving logic including the handling of foreign keys resides.\n3. `ForeignKey.get_attname`, `ForeignKey.get_attname_column`, `ForeignKey.get_default`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value`, and `ForeignKey.get_prep_value` in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are related to the ForeignKey field's behavior, which is crucial for understanding how foreign keys are managed and saved.\n\nThese code spans cover the areas of primary key management, saving related objects, and the ForeignKey field's behavior, which are central to solving the reported issue.",
