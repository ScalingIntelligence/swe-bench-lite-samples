            "scratch_pad": "1. The reported issue pertains to how Django handles foreign key relationships when the primary key of the related model is a non-numeric, non-autoincremented CharField. The issue arises when trying to save a parent object after setting a foreign key to a child object that has not yet been saved. The primary key of the child is not properly propagated to the parent, leading to data loss.\n2. The search results provide several key sections of Django's Model class implementation. These sections include methods for initializing a model instance (__init__), saving a model instance (save and _save_table), and preparing related fields for save (_prepare_related_fields_for_save). These methods are critical for understanding how Django handles model creation and updates, particularly in relation to foreign key fields.\n3. The __init__ method shows how model instance attributes are set based on arguments and keyword arguments. The save method details the conditions under which a model instance is inserted or updated in the database. The _save_table method contains logic for actually performing the insert or update operation.\n4. The _prepare_related_fields_for_save method is particularly relevant as it ensures that related objects are saved before the parent object and that their primary keys are correctly set. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of foreign key relationships.\n5. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans include the __init__ method, which sets the related object's primary key, the save method, which orchestrates the saving process, and the _prepare_related_fields_for_save method, which ensures related objects are properly saved before the parent. These sections provide a complete picture of how Django models handle saving operations and related fields.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
