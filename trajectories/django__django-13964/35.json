            "scratch_pad": "In the reported issue, the main concern is about how the foreign key relationship between the Order and Product models is handled when the Product model has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. Specifically, when the foreign key is set on the parent (Order) before the primary key (sku) is defined in the child (Product), the parent does not correctly see the primary key's change, leading to data loss or inconsistencies. The relevant code spans should focus on the ForeignKey class and its methods, as well as the Model class where the save and related operations are handled.\n\nFrom the search results, several key spans are identified as relevant:\n- ForeignKey class initialization (__init__ method), especially how it handles the 'to' parameter which refers to the related model.\n- The validate method of ForeignKey, which checks the existence of the related instance.\n- The db_type and db_parameters methods of ForeignKey; although not directly linked to the issue description, understanding how the field type is determined for database operations could be significant.\n- The _save_parents and _save_table methods in the Model class are particularly relevant as they handle saving logic and managing primary keys.\n- The _prepare_related_fields_for_save method in the Model class, which is likely to handle the scenario described in the issue about preparing related fields before saving.\n- The get_prep_value method in the CharField class might also be indirectly relevant if data processing before saving involves this method.\n\nThese spans cover the initialization, validation, and saving aspects of the ForeignKey relationship, and the overall model saving process, which align with the details given in the issue. It is likely that further analysis or adjustments in these areas may resolve the issues described.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
