This is particularly problematic when the related instance is created with an empty primary key and later modified. Understanding how ForeignKey and OneToOneField manage relations and primary keys is crucial. The code spans that are most relevant to this issue are those that deal with the initialization and saving of objects, especially in the context of ForeignKey and OneToOneField relations. In the search results, we find several key spans that are relevant to the issue:\n\n1. ForeignKey.__init__: This section initializes the ForeignKey field and its relationship, setting necessary parameters like on_delete, related_name, etc. Understanding how the initialization of ForeignKey interacts with model instances and their primary keys is vital.\n\n2. Model.__init__: This span covers the model's initialization method, which is essential as it sets attributes for instances, including those managed by ForeignKey and OneToOneField. How arguments are passed and attributes are set during instance creation can influence the behavior of related fields.\n\n3. Model._save_parents and Model._save_table: These sections handle the saving mechanism of the model, including how related parent objects are handled. The behavior of these methods is critical in understanding how changes to instances, such as the primary key settings, are persisted or not during the save operation.\n\nBy focusing on these sections, we can understand how ForeignKey and OneToOneField interact with model instances, how primary keys are managed, and how data is saved or might be lost during saving operations.",

To address this, it's important to look at how the ForeignKey and Model classes handle primary key assignments and saves, especially the `__init__`, `save`, and `_save_table` methods. In the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans: \n1. The `ForeignKey.__init__` method, which initializes the foreign key relation and sets the primary key field. \n2. The `Model.__init__` method, which initializes model instances and assigns fields, including foreign key relations. \n3. The `Model.save` and `Model.save_base` methods, which handle saving model instances to the database, including saving related objects. \n4. The `Model._save_table` method, which is responsible for saving the model's table to the database and handling updates and inserts. \nThese code spans collectively show how model instances are created, how related objects (like foreign keys with non-numeric primary keys) are handled, and how the save process works. The identified code spans are relevant because they directly deal with the assignment and saving of foreign key relations and primary keys, which are central to the reported issue. Including these spans provides a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be examined or modified to address the issue.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
