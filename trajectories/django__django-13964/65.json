The analysis of the search results reveals relevant code spans in `ForeignKey` and `Model` classes. `ForeignKey.__init__` handles the initialization of the ForeignKey relation, which is crucial for understanding how the relation is set. Similarly, `Model.__init__` and `Model._save_table` are important as they involve the actual saving of the model instances and the handling of related fields. These code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they demonstrate how the foreign key is managed and how related objects are saved, aligning with the concern over data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys. Additionally, the `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save` method is relevant as it ensures related fields are properly handled during save operations, further emphasizing the connection to the reported issue of unsaved related objects potentially causing data loss.",

The `Product` model has a non-auto `CharField` as its primary key (`sku`), while the `Order` model has a foreign key relation to `Product`. The issue arises when initializing the foreign key relation on the parent with an empty instance and subsequently defining its primary key.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\n   The current context provided in the <file_context> tag shows the `Model` and `ForeignKey` class definitions from `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n   3.1. Identify Relevant Spans in `django/db/models/base.py`:\n      - `Model._save_table`: This method handles saving the model instance to the database, which could be relevant for understanding how the foreign key is handled during save operations.\n      - `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`: This method checks and prepares related fields for saving, which might handle the scenario of an unsaved related instance being assigned to the parent model.\n   3.2. Identify Relevant Spans in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`:\n      - `ForeignKey.get_attname`, `ForeignKey.get_attname_column`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save`, `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value`, `ForeignKey.get_prep_value`: These methods are related to attribute name generation and database preparation for foreign key fields, which could be relevant for understanding how the foreign key values are processed.\n      - `ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class`: This method contributes properties to the related class which could be relevant for understanding how the foreign key relationship is initialized.\n\n4. Decide if Search Task is Complete:\n   Based on the identified spans, the provided search results seem to cover key areas relevant to the reported issue, including model saving, foreign key initialization, and database preparation. However, additional context or deeper analysis of the identified code spans may be required to fully understand and address the issue.",

Specifically, the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file includes the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes which are directly related to handling foreign key relationships and primary keys in models. The 'django/db/models/base.py' file covers the Model initialization, related field handling during save, and concrete field handling which could address the issues of saving related objects and managing primary keys. These files appear to cover the relevant areas to address the reported issue regarding data loss with non-numeric primary keys on saving related objects.",
