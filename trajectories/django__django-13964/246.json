The issue involves handling the primary key of a related model when it's not an auto-increment field and ensuring that the foreign key in the parent model is correctly updated upon saving the child model. Here's the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py**:\n   - The `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.__set__` method is relevant as it handles the assignment of related objects and ensures that the foreign key fields are correctly set.\n   - The `ForwardOneToOneDescriptor.__set__` method, which inherits from `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor`, is also relevant, especially due to its handling of primary key assignments in one-to-one relationships.\n\n2. **django/db/models/base.py**:\n   - The `Model._get_pk_val` and `Model._set_pk_val` methods are crucial for getting and setting the primary key value, respectively. This is directly related to the handling of non-auto primary keys.\n   - The `Model._save_parents` and `Model._save_table` methods involve saving models and their related parents, which could impact how the primary key of the related model is handled when saving.\n\n3. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**:\n   - The `ForeignKey` class contains methods like `get_attname`, `get_attname_column`, `get_default`, `get_db_prep_save`, `get_db_prep_value`, `get_prep_value`, and `contribute_to_related_class`, all of which manage the foreign key and its relation to the related model. This includes how the foreign key is stored and prepared for the database.\n   - The `OneToOneField` class, which extends `ForeignKey`, is particularly relevant due to its one-to-one relationship nature and how it might handle primary key propagation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant spans of code are those that handle the setting and getting of primary keys, the assignment and storage of foreign keys, and the saving of related model instances. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue of data loss when the parent model does not immediately 'see' changes to the primary key upon saving the child model.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
