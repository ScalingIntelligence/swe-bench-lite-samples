The problem arises when the related instance is initialized with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined. This leads to the parent object not 'seeing' the primary key's change, causing data loss. The issue seems to be related to how the foreign key is handled at assignment, particularly in relation to auto vs non-auto primary keys. The relevant code spans identified are those which deal with model initialization and saving, specifically in the handling of primary keys and foreign keys. These spans include the '__init__' method in the 'Model' class from 'django/db/models/base.py' which deals with initializing model instances, the '_save_parents' method which handles saving related instances, and the 'ForeignKey' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' which defines and validates foreign keys. Additionally, the related methods '_save_table' and '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' in 'django/db/models/base.py' are relevant as they handle saving and preparing related fields, which could contribute to understanding how foreign key fields are processed when merging webschemas.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
