            "scratch_pad": "The issue concerns the handling of foreign key relations in Django models when the parent model has a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The problem occurs when setting the foreign key on an unsaved instance of the parent model, which leads to data loss as the foreign key field is not updated with the primary key of the parent model once it is saved. This behavior is likely related to how Django handles the assignment and saving of foreign key fields, particularly when dealing with non-auto primary keys. To address this, it's important to focus on the methods responsible for saving model instances, handling foreign key relationships, and the specific behavior of non-auto primary keys during these operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is related to the handling of foreign keys and primary keys in Django's ORM, particularly when dealing with non-auto CharField primary keys. The issue describes a scenario where setting a foreign key on a parent object with an unsaved child object leads to data loss due to the parent object not 'seeing' the primary key's change. This can result in the foreign key being set to an empty string instead of the correct primary key value, leading to inconsistencies and potential data loss.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code from `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. Specifically, I identified the following spans of code as relevant:\n\n1. `ForeignKey.__init__`: This method initializes the ForeignKey field and sets up the related model and field. It is crucial for understanding how foreign keys are constructed.\n2. `ForeignKey.get_attname_column`: This method returns the attribute name and column name for the foreign key field. This is relevant in understanding how the foreign key is stored and referenced in the database.\n3. `ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class`: This method contributes to the related class, setting up the reverse relation. Understanding this can help in identifying how changes in one model propagate to the related model.\n4. `Model._save_parents`: This method handles saving of parent objects. This is crucial for understanding how changes to parent objects are handled during save operations.\n5. `Model._save_table`: This method handles the actual saving of the table. Understanding this can help in identifying how the foreign key values are processed and stored during save operations.\n6. `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`: This method prepares related fields for save, ensuring that related objects are properly handled before saving. This is particularly relevant to the issue, as it deals with the handling of related objects and their primary keys.\n\nThese code spans provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the reported issue. Further analysis and possibly modifications to these methods might be necessary to ensure that foreign key fields correctly reference related objects with non-auto primary keys.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
