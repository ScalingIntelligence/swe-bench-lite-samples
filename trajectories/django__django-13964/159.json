            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around how Django handles foreign key relations when the primary key is a non-auto CharField. Specifically, it seems that the foreign key field (`product_id`) in the `Order` model is not being correctly updated with the primary key (`sku`) of the related `Product` model when the `Product` instance is saved after being assigned to the `Order` instance. This leads to data loss or incorrect data persistence. The focus should be on understanding how foreign key fields are managed when the related instance is saved, and how auto vs non-auto primary keys are handled. Given the provided context, the search should focus on methods and classes from `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, and potentially `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` that deal with saving related objects, handling foreign keys, and managing primary keys.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a data loss scenario when dealing with a foreign key relation to a model that uses a non-auto CharField as its primary key. The issue occurs when a parent object (Order) is saved after setting a related child object (Product) which has an unsaved state initially and then has its primary key set and saved. The problem lies in how the primary key value of the related child object is handled during the save process, leading to data loss or incorrect foreign key values.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans, several relevant sections can be identified:\n1. The `Model._get_pk_val` and `Model._set_pk_val` methods in `django/db/models/base.py` are crucial for accessing and setting the primary key value of a model instance. These methods are used in the save process and could be where the primary key handling logic is defined.\n2. The `Model.save` method, also in `django/db/models/base.py`, outlines the save process for a model instance. This includes checking and setting deferred fields and handling the save operation on related objects.\n3. The `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` contains methods related to the validation and handling of foreign key relations, including `ForeignKey.validate`, `ForeignKey.get_attname`, and `ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save`. These methods are essential for ensuring the integrity of foreign key relations.\n4. The `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` includes checks for field configurations such as `Field._check_null_allowed_for_primary_keys`, which ensures that primary keys do not allow null values unless the backend interprets empty strings as nulls.\n\nThese identified code spans provide a foundation for understanding and potentially addressing the issue related to handling non-auto primary keys and foreign key relations during the save process.",

These segments are pertinent to understanding how Django handles model initialization, foreign key relationships, and field management, which are central to the reported issue concerning the handling of non-auto primary keys in related models. The code related to saving related objects, managing foreign keys, and handling primary keys is well-represented in these excerpts.
