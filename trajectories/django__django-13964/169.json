The primary focus is on understanding how the ForeignKey field in Django handles the assignment of primary keys and ensures the integrity of the relationship when primary keys are assigned after the relation is initialized. The search results provide insights into the ForeignKey class and its methods, which are directly related to the issue reported. Specifically, the ForeignKey.__init__ method, ForeignKey.get_attname, ForeignKey.get_attname_column, ForeignKey.get_default, ForeignKey.get_db_prep_save, ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value, ForeignKey.get_prep_value, and ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class methods are all relevant as they deal with how the ForeignKey field processes and saves related objects, which aligns with the core of the reported issue. Additionally, the CASCADE function in the deletion module is also relevant as it handles the cascading deletion behavior, which could be related to the transaction behavior mentioned in the issue. Therefore, these code spans can help in diagnosing and potentially addressing the issue related to data loss when dealing with non-numeric primary keys.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
