The problem arises when the parent object is saved after setting it on the child object, leading to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key. The key areas to investigate are how foreign key relations are handled, specifically in the context of non-auto primary keys. The relevant files are likely in the `django/db/models` directory, focusing on `base.py`, `fields/related.py`, and `fields/__init__.py`.",

This leads to data loss because the foreign key is incorrectly set to an empty string instead of the actual primary key value of the parent object.\n\nThe search results provide insight into the Django ORM's handling of model relationships and foreign keys. The 'base.py' file contains the core `Model` class with methods such as `__init__`, `_save_parents`, `_save_table`, and `_prepare_related_fields_for_save`, which are directly related to saving and updating models and their related fields.\n\nSpecifically, the `Model._save_parents` method deals with saving parent models in a hierarchy and updating their fields. The `Model._save_table` method handles the saving of the model's table, which includes updating fields. These methods are crucial for understanding how Django handles the saving and updating of related models.\n\nIn the 'related.py' file, the `ForeignKey` class is defined with methods such as `__init__`, `contribute_to_related_class`, and `get_attname`. These methods are essential for understanding how foreign keys are handled in Django, including their initialization and contribution to related classes.\n\nBased on the search results, the identified code spans should include those methods from the `Model` class and the `ForeignKey` class that directly involve handling model saving, updating, and related fields. This includes `Model.__init__`, `Model._save_parents`, `Model._save_table`, `Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save`, and from the `ForeignKey` class: `ForeignKey.__init__`, `ForeignKey.contribute_to_related_class`, and `ForeignKey.get_attname`.",

The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku=\"\" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.\nOn the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:\nwith transaction.atomic():\n\torder = Order()\n\torder.product = Product(sku=\"foo\")\n\torder.product.save()\n\torder.save()\n\tassert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds\nCommitting the transaction also succeeds.\nThis may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.\n"
