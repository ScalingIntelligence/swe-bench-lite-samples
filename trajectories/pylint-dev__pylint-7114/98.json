The issue specifically mentions the failure to find an `__init__.py` file, which leads to the linting process failing. The main focus seems to be on the handling of module paths and the detection of modules or packages.\n\nIn the search results, there are several key functions that could be relevant to this issue. The `_modpath_from_file` function deals with determining the module path from a file, which is crucial for understanding if a file should be treated as a module or package. The `get_python_path` function also seems relevant as it determines the Python path and checks for the existence of `__init__.py` files.\n\nAnother important function is `expand_modules`, which expands the list of files or modules into a more detailed description, including paths and module names. This process includes handling the existence of files and directories, which could be directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nIn the `PyLinter` class, the `check_single_file` method is relevant as it deals with checking individual files, which could potentially fail due to the module naming issue described. Even though this method is deprecated, it still gives insight into how files are processed by the linter.\n\nGiven these functions and methods, it seems that the search results contain relevant code that could help understand and potentially fix the issue described. The functions handling module path detection and file existence checks are particularly important.",

For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
