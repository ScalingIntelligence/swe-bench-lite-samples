Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
