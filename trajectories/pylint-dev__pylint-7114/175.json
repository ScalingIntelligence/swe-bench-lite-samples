Specifically, the function `modpath_from_file` in `modutils` is used in `expand_modules` to derive module paths from files. If a file has the same name as its containing module directory, it could potentially confuse the function, leading it to incorrectly assume the presence of a package and thus search for an `__init__.py` file. This hypothesis is supported by the `modpath_from_file` function's dependency on `_is_package_cb`, which checks for the presence of `__init__.py` or if the directory is a namespace package. Further examination of these functions could reveal if the logic for distinguishing between files and packages is failing under these specific conditions.",
