The search results provided contain several code spans that are potentially relevant to the issue.

Additionally, the `expand_modules` function in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` deals with expanding module paths, which could be related to how the modules are found and processed. These methods involve functionalities such as file path handling, module name resolution, and error handling during the linting process, all of which are directly related to the described issue. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

This confusion is apparent in the code's behavior where it expects an __init__.py file in the directory of the same name as the module. To fix this, we need to ensure that the module name and directory name do not conflict in a way that leads to the erroneous search for an __init__.py file when it's not necessary.
