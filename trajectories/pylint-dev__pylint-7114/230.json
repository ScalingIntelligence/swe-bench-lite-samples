The desired behavior is for `pylint a` to succeed regardless of the file name conflict.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the most relevant file appears to be `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`. This file contains multiple spans that are likely relevant:\n1. `PyLinter._discover_files`: This method is responsible for discovering and yielding files to be checked. It checks if directories contain an `__init__.py` file, which is crucial for handling modules and packages.\n2. `PyLinter._expand_files`: This method expands the list of modules to be checked. It might be involved in handling module resolution issues.\n3. `PyLinter.get_ast`: This method gets the AST for a given file, which is fundamental for subsequent linting steps. Any issues in AST generation could contribute to linting failures.\n\nThese spans are the key functionalities related to file discovery, module expansion, and AST generation, all of which are critical for understanding and resolving the reported issue.\n\nNo other files in the search results appear as directly relevant to the module resolution problem described in the issue.

To address this, we need to modify the `_discover_files` method to handle this specific case. The current implementation of `_discover_files` does not account for this edge case where the directory name and the file name are the same. We should adjust the method to ensure that it correctly identifies Python files even when their names match the directory name they are in.",
