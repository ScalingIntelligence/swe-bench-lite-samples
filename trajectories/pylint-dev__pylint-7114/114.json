The problem seems to be related to how pylint handles module paths and file discovery, especially when there's a conflict between module and file names. The relevant functions to investigate are likely those involved in module path discovery and file parsing, such as '_modpath_from_file', 'get_python_path', 'expand_modules', and possibly the '_discover_files' method in the PyLinter class. Additionally, the '_get_namespace_for_file' method might also be relevant for understanding how namespaces are handled. Lastly, the '_parse_error_mode' method could be examined to see how errors are managed during parsing.",

This is a critical issue as it affects module resolution and the overall linting process. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily from the `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` and `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` files. These spans focus on module expansion and file discovery functions, which are directly related to the reported issue. Specifically, the `expand_modules` function and its subsidiary functions (`_modpath_from_file` and `get_python_path`) play a crucial role in determining the correct module paths and handling package/module structures. Additionally, the `_discover_files` function in `pylinter.py` is relevant as it helps in discovering and iterating over files, which is also part of the module resolution process. The identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the module discovery and expansion mechanisms within pylint, which are essential for addressing the issue reported.",

The provided search results contain several spans of code, but the key portion that should be examined is the `_modpath_from_file` function in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py`, which is crucial for determining the module path from a file and checking if it's a package. This function uses `modutils.modpath_from_file_with_callback`, which might be causing the erroneous assumption that an `__init__.py` file should exist because the directory and module share the same name. Furthermore, examining the `get_python_path` function in the same file could provide insights into how directory paths are determined for linting, which could also be contributing to the issue if it incorrectly enforces the existence of an `__init__.py` file in directories with a module of the same name. The `expand_modules` function is also relevant, as it orchestrates the expansion of files and modules to be linted, and could contain the logic mistakenly expecting an `__init__.py` file. In the `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` file, the `_discover_files` and `_expand_files` methods are involved in identifying files to be linted, including how directories are treated as potential packages. These methods could either be the source of the problem or illustrate how linting expects certain directory structures (like needing an `__init__.py`).",
