            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about a specific scenario where a module named `a` containing a file named `a.py` causes `pylint` to fail. The failure is due to a parsing error indicating that it's trying to find an `__init__.py` file with no success. Renaming `a.py` to something else (like `c.py`) resolves the issue, which suggests a conflict or confusion in how `pylint` processes modules and files with similar names. From the current context, we already have identified messages related to parsing errors (F0010) in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`. New search results show additional methods in `PyLinter` class that handle file discovery and module expansion, which are closely related to the issue of resolving file paths and understanding the module structure. These methods like `_discover_files`, `check`, `_iterate_file_descrs`, and `_expand_files` appear relevant for understanding how files and modules are processed. The `expand_modules` function in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` also seems to play a crucial role in this process, as it expands and filters the files to be checked. These sections of the code directly touch on the action of determining what files to process and how to handle their names, which is central to the reported issue. Therefore, these additional pieces of code should be examined to identify where the confusion might be occurring and to understand what checks or steps might be missing to correctly handle or differentiate between modules and files. By understanding these functions and methods, we can deduce how `pylint` tries to resolve modules and file paths, and make targeted adjustments to prevent mixing up modules with similarly named files. The additional context and code provide a clearer picture of where in the process such errors might emerge, ensuring the right area is checked or modified for a potential fix.",

The key aspect of the issue involves how Pylint handles directories and files, particularly the presence of an `__init__.py` file. This file is crucial as it indicates that the directory should be treated as a package, and its absence is causing the linting to fail. Both sets of provided code are relevant to this issue. The first set includes the `PyLinter` class which is central to the linting process, and its methods such as `_expand_files` which processes modules. The second set includes functions and logic related to module expansion and handling, such as `expand_modules` and `_modpath_from_file`. These functions play a role in identifying and managing modules and packages, which is directly related to the issue described. The code spans provided align with the issue of module and package handling, particularly with respect to the presence or absence of `__init__.py` files.

The 'expand_modules' function carefully handles paths and module names, including checks for packages and resolving module paths. Given this context, it appears that the issue might arise from the logic within 'expand_modules', particularly how it deals with module paths and file existence checks, especially when a module and a file have the same name.

  "initial_message": "Linting fails if module contains module of the same name\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven multiple files:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n`-- a/\r\n    |-- a.py\r\n    `-- b.py\r\n```\r\nWhich are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint a\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv a/a.py a/c.py\r\n$ pylint a\r\n$\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 3.0.0a3\r\nastroid 2.5.6\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15) \r\n[GCC 9.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThis also has some side-effects in module resolution. For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
