Specifically, having an `a.py` inside a directory `a` causes pylint to fail when it searches for an `__init__.py` file. This issue might be related to how pylint discovers and expands files, particularly how it handles directories and the presence of files like `__init__.py`. In the provided search results, there are two methods of interest: `PyLinter._discover_files` and `PyLinter._expand_files`. The `_discover_files` method is responsible for discovering files based on the input, whether they are modules or files, and seems to handle the logic of walking through directories and considering `__init__.py` files, which is relevant to the issue. The `_expand_files` method expands modules and handles errors during this process, suggesting it could also be related to the issue if module expansion fails due to the presence of files with the same name. Given these observations, both methods seem relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
