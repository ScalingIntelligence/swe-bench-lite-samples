Specifically, the presence of a module named `a.py` within a directory named `a` leads to a failure in pylint execution due to the expected presence of an `__init__.py` file that isn't found. This issue affects the module resolution and file discovery processes in pylint. The provided code snippets, particularly from `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, contain methods responsible for file discovery and module initialization, such as `_discover_files` and `_expand_files`. These methods are crucial for identifying and handling module files, including checking for directories and potential `__init__.py` files. The method `should_analyze_file` in `PyLinter` also plays a role in determining whether a particular file should be analyzed, which might be relevant for this issue. Additionally, the `expand_modules` function in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` is responsible for expanding module paths and handling exceptions, which could be where the resolution of the `No such file or directory` error begins. To address the issue, these areas of code could be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that the presence of a module file with the same name as its directory does not lead to such errors. Furthermore, there might be a need to adjust how directory initialization and module loading are handled to prevent these kinds of failures in the future.",

These sections handle file discovery, module expansion, and error management during the linting process, which are directly related to the reported issue regarding module resolution and file naming conflicts. By analyzing these sections, one can understand how Pylint handles modules and files, and why naming a file the same as its containing directory might cause issues. Furthermore, the `should_analyze_file` method in `PyLinter` and the `_modpath_from_file` function in `expand_modules` are particularly relevant as they deal with file analysis and module path resolution, respectively.

  "initial_message": "Linting fails if module contains module of the same name\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven multiple files:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n`-- a/\r\n    |-- a.py\r\n    `-- b.py\r\n```\r\nWhich are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint a\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv a/a.py a/c.py\r\n$ pylint a\r\n$\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 3.0.0a3\r\nastroid 2.5.6\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15) \r\n[GCC 9.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThis also has some side-effects in module resolution. For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
