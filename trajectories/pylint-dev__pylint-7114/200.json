Specifically, the functions _modpath_from_file, get_python_path, and expand_modules in pylint/lint/expand_modules.py handle module path resolution, checking for __init__.py files, and expanding module lists, which could be directly related to the issue. Additionally, the method _discover_files in pylint/lint/pylinter.py also deals with file discovery in directories, which could be relevant due to the issue involving directory-based modules.

In `_modpath_from_file`, the function `modutils.modpath_from_file_with_callback` is used with a callback function `_is_package_cb` that determines if a module path has an `__init__.py` file using `modutils.check_modpath_has_init`. This mechanism might be what leads to the issue when a file shares its name with its parent directory, as it could mistakenly expect an `__init__.py` file where there isn't one. Additionally, `get_python_path` checks for the presence of an `__init__.py` file in the directory hierarchy. If it doesn't find one and determines the current directory doesn't contain a Python package, it returns the directory's path. This function might also play a role in the issue by incorrectly interpreting the directory structure when a file's name matches its parent directory's name, leading to erroneous expectations about there being an `__init__.py` file.",

  "initial_message": "Linting fails if module contains module of the same name\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven multiple files:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n`-- a/\r\n    |-- a.py\r\n    `-- b.py\r\n```\r\nWhich are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint a\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv a/a.py a/c.py\r\n$ pylint a\r\n$\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 3.0.0a3\r\nastroid 2.5.6\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15) \r\n[GCC 9.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThis also has some side-effects in module resolution. For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
