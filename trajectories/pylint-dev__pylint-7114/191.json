The search results provide relevant code spans in `pylinter.py` that handle file discovery and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) creation. Specifically, the `PyLinter._discover_files` method is responsible for discovering files and directories, which is crucial for identifying the correct modules to lint. Additionally, the `PyLinter.get_ast` method is responsible for generating the AST representation of the module, which is directly related to the parsing error mentioned in the issue.

This suggests a problem in how pylint handles module discovery and file paths, potentially in methods like `_discover_files` and `get_ast`. The provided file context includes the `_discover_files` method which iterates over files and treats directories with '__init__.py' files as Python packages. Additionally, the `get_ast` method is responsible for creating an abstract syntax tree from Python files. Given the description of the issue, these methods are central to the problem's resolution. Specifically, investigating any checks or assumptions made within these functions regarding the presence of '__init__.py' files or how module names and file names are handled in relation to each other could provide insights into why pylint is failing in these scenarios. Based on the provided context, it seems that the key parts of the codebase related to this issue have been identified, and further investigation specifically into these methods should help resolve the issue.",

For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
