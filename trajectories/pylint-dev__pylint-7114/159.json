The search results show relevant code spans in the initialization and file discovery process of the PyLinter class. Specifically, the initialization (span id='PyLinter.__init__') sets up the linter, and methods like '_discover_files' and '_expand_files' (span id='PyLinter._discover_files' and span id='PyLinter._expand_files') are vital for file and module discovery. These methods could influence how the linter handles files named similarly to their parent modules. Additionally, the 'get_ast' method (span id='PyLinter.get_ast') is important for the actual parsing of the code, which could fail if there are issues with module resolution or file existence checks. In 'expand_modules.py', the 'expand_modules' function (span id='expand_modules') is crucial for expanding module paths and handling ignored files, which could be related to the issue if the module name and file name conflict is not managed correctly. This analysis suggests that the identified code spans are relevant to the issue, as they deal with module and file handling during the linting process, which is central to the reported problem.",
