This leads to a failure in finding the '__init__.py' file, which is necessary for module initialization. The relevant code spans should focus on the logic related to module loading, file path resolution, and handling of module names. The provided search results include several key functions and methods in the Pylint codebase that handle these aspects: `PyLinter._expand_files`, `PyLinter.set_current_module`, and `PyLinter._get_namespace_for_file` in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, and `_modpath_from_file`, `get_python_path`, and `expand_modules` in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py`. These functions and methods are directly involved in expanding module paths, setting the current module context, and resolving file paths for module loading.

The failure occurs due to a conflict where the module name 'a' is both a directory and a Python file. The relevant code spans provided in the search results and file context primarily focus on the module expansion and the Pylint initialization processes, which are key to understanding how Pylint handles file and module paths during its execution. Specifically, the `expand_modules` function in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` and the `PyLinter` class in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` are central to this issue. The `expand_modules` function is responsible for determining the module paths and handling errors during module expansion, while the `PyLinter` class initializes the Pylint process and manages the current module settings. Parsing the code reveals that the current logic in module expansion and particularly the handling of directories and files like 'a/a.py' does not account for the case where a file's name conflicts with its parent directory's name. This discrepancy leads to the described failures in linting. The search results, therefore, are relevant and provide a basis for identifying the parts of the code that need to be adjusted to handle such name conflicts more gracefully. Adjusting the logic in `_expand_files` and `expand_modules` could be a potential solution. After analyzing the provided code and the issue, it is clear that the identified span in 'pylint/lint/expand_modules.py' (span id 'expand_modules') and the associated module expansion logic can be crucial in resolving this issue.",

  "initial_message": "Linting fails if module contains module of the same name\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven multiple files:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n`-- a/\r\n    |-- a.py\r\n    `-- b.py\r\n```\r\nWhich are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint a\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv a/a.py a/c.py\r\n$ pylint a\r\n$\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 3.0.0a3\r\nastroid 2.5.6\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15) \r\n[GCC 9.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThis also has some side-effects in module resolution. For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
