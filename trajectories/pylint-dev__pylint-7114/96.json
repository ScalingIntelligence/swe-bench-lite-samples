This can cause confusion and lead to errors such as failing to locate an `__init__.py` file. The search results provide insights into how pylint handles module and file paths, particularly in the `expand_modules` function and the `PyLinter` class. The `expand_modules` function is responsible for converting files or modules into detailed descriptions, while the `PyLinter` class manages the linting process, including file discovery and expansion. Relevant code spans include the `_modpath_from_file` function, which calculates module paths from file paths, and the `expand_modules` function, which processes input files or modules. Additionally, the `PyLinter._discover_files` and `PyLinter._expand_files` methods handle the discovery and expansion of files involved in the linting process. These spans are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to module name conflicts. Therefore, the search task is not complete, but significant progress has been made by identifying these key areas.",
