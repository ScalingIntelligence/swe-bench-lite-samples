This results in Pylint attempting to load an '__init__.py' file, which does not exist, causing the linting process to fail. The task is to identify relevant code spans within the provided search results that might be responsible for this behavior or can be modified to handle this scenario.\n\nThe search results include several spans within the `PyLinter` class in the 'pylint/lint/pylinter.py' file. Important spans to consider include:\n- 'PyLinter': The main class definition for the Pylint linter.\n- 'PyLinter.__init__': The initializer method where many setup and configuration actions are performed.\n- 'PyLinter._discover_files': A method responsible for discovering and listing files to be linted. This method might be the one attempting to load the '__init__.py' file.\n- 'PyLinter.check_single_file': A method used for checking a single file, which is deprecated but might still influence the behavior.\n\nConsidering the issue, the method '_discover_files' appears to be directly related, as it is where the discovery and handling of module files take place. Specifically, this method checks for the presence of an '__init__.py' file within directories. Any modifications or checks to handle cases where such a file does not exist, such as when a module contains a file with the same name, would likely need to be implemented here.\n\nThus, the relevant code span to focus on is 'PyLinter._discover_files', as it directly handles the file and directory discovery, which is where the reported issue manifests.",

However, the file context does not include the entire codebase, particularly the part where the conflict between the module name and directory name is specifically handled or logged as an error. It's also important to note that while `_discover_files` hints at potential issues in file discovery, the exact validation or error handling for this specific conflict is not detailed in the provided context.

Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
