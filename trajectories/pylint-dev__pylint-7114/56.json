Additionally, the `expand_modules` function in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` is relevant as it expands the given files or modules into a list of module descriptions, which might help in understanding how Pylint handles module names and paths.

This scenario triggers an erroneous search for an __init__.py file. The provided file context includes the PyLinter class from pylint/lint/pylinter.py, which is primarily responsible for handling the linting process and defining message definitions related to linting errors, including those related to module parsing. Significantly, the _expand_files, _discover_files, and related methods within the PyLinter class handle the discovery of files for linting, which is directly related to the issue described. In pylint/lint/expand_modules.py, the expand_modules function and associated methods, such as get_python_path and _modpath_from_file, play key roles in determining the module's path and file discovery. These methods initialize module paths, check for file existence, and handle imports and potential exceptions during the module expansion process. Given these observations, the relevant sections within the file context directly relate to the reported issue, and they provide a comprehensive set of functionality needed to address the core handling of file and module discovery within the pylint utility. This suggests that the file context is not only relevant to fixing the reported issue but it is also complete, enabling one to trace the file and module discovery process accurately and modify the relevant parts of the code to prevent errors from occurring under these specific conditions.",

  "initial_message": "Linting fails if module contains module of the same name\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven multiple files:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n`-- a/\r\n    |-- a.py\r\n    `-- b.py\r\n```\r\nWhich are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint a\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv a/a.py a/c.py\r\n$ pylint a\r\n$\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 3.0.0a3\r\nastroid 2.5.6\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15) \r\n[GCC 9.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThis also has some side-effects in module resolution. For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
