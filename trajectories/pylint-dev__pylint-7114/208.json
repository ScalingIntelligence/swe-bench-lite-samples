This issue affects module resolution and linting outcomes when certain file structures are present. The search results include several functions and methods that deal with module expansion, file path handling, and module detection, which are likely relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, the functions `_modpath_from_file`, `get_python_path`, and `expand_modules` from `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` are of interest as they handle module path resolution and file existence checks, which are central to the issue. Additionally, methods in the `PyLinter` class from `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, such as `_discover_files`, `_expand_files`, and `get_ast`, are relevant as they involve file discovery and AST generation, processes that could be impacted by the file naming conflict. These spans of code are likely to contain the necessary logic to address or at least understand the cause of the reported issue. Further analysis or modification of these functions and methods could lead to a resolution or workaround for the problem described.",
