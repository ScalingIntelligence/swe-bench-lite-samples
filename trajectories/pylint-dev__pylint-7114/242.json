This issue affects the module resolution and linting process when such a naming conflict exists.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results from `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, we find two significant code spans:\n1. The `PyLinter` class definition, which is central to the Pylint operation.\n2. The `PyLinter._discover_files` method, which is responsible for discovering files and modules during the linting process.\n\nIn the `PyLinter._discover_files` method, there is a check for the presence of `__init__.py` within directories. This method is likely where the error is being triggered, as it incorrectly identifies directories without an `__init__.py` file as non-packages, leading to the erroneous search and subsequent failure. This part of the code should be closely examined and potentially modified to handle such naming conflicts correctly.\n\nTo address the reported issue, the code related to file and module discovery in the `PyLinter._discover_files` method is highlighted as relevant.

The current behavior is that pylint looks for and fails to find an '__init__.py' file in such scenarios, leading to a parse error. To address this, it's important to examine the way pylint handles directory traversal and file parsing, particularly focusing on the condition that checks for the presence of an '__init__.py' file. The provided search results include several relevant spans from the `PyLinter` class in `pylinter.py`, which are primarily focused on file discovery and parsing. Notably, the `_discover_files` method is directly relevant as it contains logic for checking the existence of '__init__.py' files within directories. This method and its logic seem to be at the core of the issue reported. Additional spans like `option_groups`, `load_default_plugins`, and others provide context but are not directly addressing the core issue of file traversal and detection.",

This method assumes the presence of an `__init__.py` file when encountering directories, which could explain the reported behavior. The logic in `_discover_files` appears to be the focal point for addressing the issue, as it directly affects how files and directories are processed and might need to be adjusted to better handle cases where a module and a directory share the same name without expecting an `__init__.py` file. Given the specificity of the issue and the presence of the relevant method within the provided code, it seems that all relevant file context to understand the problem and potentially implement a fix is provided.",
