The provided search results include a class PyLinter which is the main class in Pylint that handles the linting process. This class includes methods and attributes that are crucial for understanding how pylint processes files and directories, and how it handles module discovery. The method _discover_files is particularly relevant as it deals with the discovery and traversal of files and directories. The code shows how pylint checks for the presence of an __init__.py file when discovering files, which aligns with the issue described. This suggests that the problem might stem from how pylint handles directories without an __init__.py file, especially when there's a module with a conflicting name within the directory. Given this context, the identified code spans are relevant to investigating and possibly resolving the issue. There might be a logic flaw in the file discovery mechanism that needs to be addressed.",

For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
