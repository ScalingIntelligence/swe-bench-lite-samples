The failure is due to searching for an `__init__.py` file, which shouldn't be necessary. To address this, we need to look at how Pylint handles file discovery, module expansion, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) creation. The relevant spans in the provided search results are the methods `_discover_files`, `_expand_files`, and `get_ast` within the `PyLinter` class. These methods are responsible for identifying files to lint, expanding directories into individual module paths, and generating the AST for each file. By examining these methods in detail, we can determine if they correctly handle the scenario where a module and a file have the same name.",
