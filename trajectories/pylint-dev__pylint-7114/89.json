The search results provide insights into the PyLinter class and its methods, particularly '_discover_files', '_expand_files', and 'get_ast', which are directly involved in file discovery, module expansion, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) creation. These methods are critical for understanding how Pylint processes modules and files, which is central to the reported issue. For instance, '_discover_files' is responsible for discovering and iterating over files and directories, and it checks for the presence of '__init__.py' files to determine if a directory is a package. The '_expand_files' method expands the provided modules into their respective paths, which is crucial for resolving module paths correctly. Lastly, 'get_ast' is responsible for creating the AST of the module, which is where any syntax errors would be caught and reported. Given these analyses, it appears that the provided code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly address aspects of module discovery, expansion, and the creation of ASTs, which are critical processes in the context of the issue at hand. Thus, further investigation into these methods and their interactions could potentially uncover the root cause of the issue.",
