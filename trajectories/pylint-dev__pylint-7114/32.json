To address this, I need to identify code spans that handle the file and module expansion process where a decision might be made to search for or treat a file differently based on its name. The provided search results include functions '_modpath_from_file', 'get_python_path', and 'expand_modules'. The 'expand_modules' function directly addresses the issue, managing module expansion with handling for directories and files, including an '__init__.py' check. It also associates specific errors like 'fatal' with modules that cannot be parsed. The 'get_python_path' function appears relevant for determining the Python path without an '__init__.py' check, which could affect module resolution.

This behavior is not observed when the module is renamed or when an `__init__.py` file is introduced. The analysis should focus on the module loading and file expansion logic within the `pylint` codebase.\n\nGiven the context, the relevant parts of the codebase are found in the `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` and `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` files. These files contain methods responsible for expanding files and handling the loading of modules. The `span_ids` related to module expansion and error handling are identified as particularly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nIn module expansion (`_expand_files`), the method `expand_modules` from `expand_modules.py` is used, which includes logic for handling module paths and errors. The `F0010` message definition in `pylinter.py` is relevant as it pertains to parse errors, which may be triggered by the described scenario.\n\nIn the new search results, the `check_single_file` method in `pylinter.py` is deprecated, suggesting that the `check_single_file_item` method should be the focus for file checking. This method invokes `_check_file`, which is likely central to the file-checking process and should be scrutinized for potential improvements related to the reported issue to ensure proper handling of modules without `__init__.py`.\n\nGiven these analyses, the identified spans that are most relevant to the reported issue are those related to module expansion and error handling, particularly within the `expand_modules` function and `F0010` error message definition. The specific spans to focus on are the ones addressing how module paths are determined and how errors at the parsing stage are managed.",

  "initial_message": "Linting fails if module contains module of the same name\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven multiple files:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n`-- a/\r\n    |-- a.py\r\n    `-- b.py\r\n```\r\nWhich are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint a\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv a/a.py a/c.py\r\n$ pylint a\r\n$\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 3.0.0a3\r\nastroid 2.5.6\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15) \r\n[GCC 9.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThis also has some side-effects in module resolution. For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
