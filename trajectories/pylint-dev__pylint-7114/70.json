It appears that when a module directory contains a Python file with the same name as the directory, Pylint fails to handle this situation gracefully. This could be due to confusion over whether 'a' is a module or a package when a module 'a.py' is present in a directory named 'a'. Investigating the logic in module expansion and file discovery, particularly in the '_discover_files' and '_expand_files' methods in the PyLinter class, as well as the '_modpath_from_file' function in 'expand_modules.py', might provide insights into how to resolve this.",

The provided search results include code spans that are relevant to these issues. The `PyLinter._discover_files` method is particularly relevant as it handles the discovery of files and directories, which could be where the failure to find an `__init__.py` occurs. The `_expand_files` method is also relevant as it deals with expanding module paths and handling errors, which could lead to the reported issue if not handled correctly. Additionally, the `expand_modules` function from `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` is directly related to the expansion of modules, which is central to the reported issue. These methods and functions are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue of pylint failing due to module name conflicts. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

This could involve adding a condition to check for the existence of a file with the same name as the directory and treating it appropriately without attempting to pass an invalid argument to other functions.\n\nModification is needed around lines 89-91 where the `include_implicit_namespace_packages` argument is used in `modutils.modpath_from_file`. This should be refactored to handle the file-directory conflict specifically by checking if there's a file with the same name as the directory before passing the argument.",
