The pytlinter.py file contains the primary class, PyLinter, which handles the linting process and could be a central part of the behavior reported. The __init__ method of PyLinter initializes the object and sets up various configurations, but it doesn't directly address the issue of handling same-named files. The _discover_files method iterates over files and modules, checking for presence of __init__.py, which is relevant to the issue as it is related to module recognition and parsing. This method not only checks for presence of __init__.py in directories but also handles ignoring some files and directories. Therefore, these two methods likely play a key role in the process that breaks when a module and a file within it share the same name. This relevance can help identify the implementation that is causing the linting issues when a module has a file with the same name.",

The Pylint command fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file in such scenarios. The current behavior is that Pylint fails when `a/a.py` is present, but it succeeds if `a.py` is renamed or if `__init__.py` is created. The expected behavior is that Pylint should succeed without requiring such modifications.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, I identified several key parts of the code that are relevant to this issue:\n1. `PyLinter._discover_files` in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`: This method is responsible for discovering files to be linted. It checks if directories have an `__init__.py` file, which is crucial for the reported issue because the absence of this file in the directory containing `a/a.py` might be causing the failure.\n2. `expand_modules` in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py`: This function is responsible for expanding modules to be linted. It handles the logic for determining if a file is part of a package by checking for `__init__.py` files. This is directly related to the issue as the failure to properly identify packages might trigger the error.\n3. `_modpath_from_file`, `get_python_path`, and related functions in `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py`: These functions are involved in translating file paths to module paths and determining the Python path. Misbehavior in these areas could lead to the erroneous handling of modules and package structures.\n\nThese code spans are identified as relevant based on their involvement in managing file and module discovery, which is central to understanding and resolving the issue with Pylint failing on modules with the same name.",
