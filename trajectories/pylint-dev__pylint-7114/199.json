This causes pylint to fail while searching for an `__init__.py` file, leading to errors and side effects in module resolution. The main focus should be on the `get_python_path`, `expand_modules`, `_discover_files`, and `check_single_file` functions as these are likely responsible for handling module paths and linting individual files. Additionally, the `imports` module is relevant for understanding how imports are handled and may influence the resolution of modules. Therefore, specifying these functions and the imports module as search parameters should help in pinpointing the source of the issue.",
