I then examined the new search results to ensure coverage of relevant code spans. The new search results included the same methods from the `PyLinter` class, confirming my earlier findings that these parts of the code are highly relevant to the reported issue. I identified the spans `impl:5` and the `_discover_files` method as pertinent to the issue as they handle how modules and files are parsed and discovered by pylint.
