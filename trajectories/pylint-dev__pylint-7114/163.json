This behavior is due to how `pylint` processes directories and modules. By analyzing the `PyLinter` class and its methods, particularly `PyLinter._discover_files`, it's evident that this method is responsible for discovering files and directories to be linted. The method checks if a directory contains an `__init__.py` file to determine if it's a package. If such a file is not found, it skips deeper into the directory tree. Given the issue description, the failure seems to be related to how `pylint` handles the discovery and loading of modules and packages, specifically when there's a module with the same name as a directory. The code spans related to `PyLinter._discover_files` are highly relevant as they directly deal with file and directory discovery, which is central to the issue at hand.
