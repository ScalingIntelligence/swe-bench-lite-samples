The error indicates that pylint is expecting an `__init__.py` file even when it shouldn't be necessary. The relevant files seem to be those handling module expansion and file discovery, such as `expand_modules.py`, `pylinter.py`, and `utils.py`. Focus should be on the functions and methods responsible for file and module discovery, and how they handle or expect `__init__.py` files.",

The search results reveal several relevant code spans in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, notably the `PyLinter` class and its methods such as `should_analyze_file`, `_discover_files`, and `get_ast`. These methods handle file and module discovery, analysis, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) retrieval, which are directly related to the problem of module resolution and linting. The issue likely arises due to the way file paths and module names are handled in these methods, potentially causing conflicts or errors when a module name matches its parent directory name. Other parts of the codebase, such as `_expand_files` and `_check_files`, also seem relevant for understanding how files are processed and errors are managed. Therefore, these parts of the codebase are directly involved in the linting process and could contain the specific logic that leads to the reported issue when modules have the same name as their parent directories.",

Given the existing context, it is clear that the `PyLinter` class in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` is responsible for the linting process. The new search results primarily focus on the `PyLinter` class, particularly on methods like `_discover_files` and `_expand_files`, which involve file discovery and expansion.

For example, if I create another file `r.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- a\r\n|   |-- a.py\r\n|   `-- b.py\r\n`-- r.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom a import b\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pylint -E r` will run fine, but `pylint -E r a` will fail. Not just for module a, but for module r as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module r\r\nr.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'b' in module 'a' (no-name-in-module)\r\n************* Module a\r\na/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:\r\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, if I rename `a.py` to `c.py`, `pylint -E r a` will work perfectly.\n"
