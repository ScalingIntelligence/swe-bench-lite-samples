This aligns with the focus on the method_decorator and related utility functions defined in django/utils/decorators.py. Upon analyzing the code within the context provided, it is clear that the issue at hand revolves around the correct handling of attributes when a partial function is used in the context of method decoration. The code sections related to _multi_decorate and _update_method_wrapper are directly relevant to addressing this issue, as they handle the application and updating of decorators to methods. Thus, the file context provided is complete and directly addresses the reported issue. The logic for handling attribute preservation when converting methods into partial functions during decoration is present and requires careful inspection and possible modification to ensure attributes like __name__ and __module__ are correctly preserved, which is the essence of the reported issue.",
