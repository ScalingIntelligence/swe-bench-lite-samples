Specifically, the problem arises when the function passed to the decorator is a partial object, lacking attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`. This is evidenced by an `AttributeError` in the provided example.\n\nThe relevant code can be found within `django/utils/decorators.py`. Key spans include `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator`, where the partial object handling and decorator application are managed. Notably, `_multi_decorate` uses `functools.partial` in its method binding process. This directly addresses the issue of the partial object not having expected attributes.\n\nAdditionally, `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` contains the `FunctoolsPartialSerializer` and its `serialize` method, but these seem unrelated to the issue at hand, focusing more on serialization rather than decorator handling. Thus, they are not directly relevant to resolving the `method_decorator` preservation issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the focus should remain on the `django/utils/decorators.py` file and specifically on the `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator` functions, which are directly implicated in the described problem.",

This issue is directly related to the `_multi_decorate` function and the `method_decorator` function in the `django/utils/decorators.py` file. The `_multi_decorate` function uses `functools.partial` which does not inherently carry over the attributes like `__name__` from the original function. This discrepancy is what leads to the `AttributeError`. The provided search results include the `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator` functions, which are exactly the relevant sections that need to be addressed to solve the reported issue. The `update_wrapper` function is used to try to preserve the attributes, but it seems insufficient in the case of partial objects. Therefore, the identified code spans are directly tied to the problem and provide the context needed to understand and fix the issue.",
