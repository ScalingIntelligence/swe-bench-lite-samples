Upon reviewing the code, I can see the implementation of `method_decorator`, including the `_multi_decorate` function used to apply multiple decorators and handle partial methods. The `_update_method_wrapper` function is used to update the wrapper with the wrapper of a dummy function, which should preserve the attributes. However, the specific handling of partial objects does not directly address the preservation of attributes in a way that would solve the reported issue.
