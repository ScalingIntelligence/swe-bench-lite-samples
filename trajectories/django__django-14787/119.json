This object lacks some expected attributes such as `__name__` and `__module__`. The critical component to focus on is the `method_decorator` function within Django's `django/utils/decorators.py` module, as it is likely responsible for handling such decorators. Additionally, the `_update_method_wrapper` function within the same module might also be involved in maintaining these attributes. To resolve the issue, it's essential to ensure that these functions correctly handle `functools.partial` objects. Therefore, both of these functions need a detailed review to ensure they correctly propagate or restore these attributes.",

The key elements to look for in the search results are the implementation details of `method_decorator`, `_multi_decorate`, and `_update_method_wrapper`. These functions handle the application of decorators and updating of wrapper attributes. In the provided code, `_multi_decorate` applies multiple decorators and uses `_update_method_wrapper` to update the wrapper's attributes. The `method_decorator` function itself is responsible for applying the decorator to the method. All these sections of code are directly relevant to the issue because they deal with how decorators are applied and their attributes preserved. Evaluating the entire sections of code shows that they cover the necessary logic to address the reported issue, indicating that the search results are complete.",
