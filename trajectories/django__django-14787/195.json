The primary focus is on identifying the section of code within the method_decorator that handles the partial object to ensure proper attribute preservation. Upon reviewing the search results in 'django/utils/decorators.py', the function _multi_decorate is where the partial object of the method is created and subsequently decorated. There is a clear match here with the issue, as this is the part of the code responsible for applying the decorators to the method, potentially causing the reported AttributeError. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the definition of _multi_decorate and the specific lines where the partial object is created and decorated within this function.",

The file context appears sufficient to deduce that the functionality related to applying and handling decorators, including potential partial object handling, is covered in the provided code. Further examination of the code in `_multi_decorate` and `_update_method_wrapper` confirms they attempt to manage partial objects or possibly update attributes of wrapped functions.
