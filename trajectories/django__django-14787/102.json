Specifically, it mentions that the method passed to the decorator is a partial object and lacks attributes like __name__ and __module__. The example provided includes a `logger` function being used as a method decorator, which results in an AttributeError because the partial object does not have the expected attributes.\n\nIn the provided search results, the `django/utils/decorators.py` file contains two key functions: `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator`. The `_multi_decorate` function processes a list of decorators and applies them to a method, using `functools.partial` to bind the method to the instance. This is particularly relevant because it shows how the method is transformed into a partial object, which is likely causing the issue described.\n\nThe `method_decorator` function is used to apply a decorator to a method. It checks if the decorator is iterable and handles the method accordingly, including a call to `_multi_decorate`. This function is central to the expected usage of decorators in the context of the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator` functions are directly related to the reported issue: they reveal how the method is transformed into a partial object and how decorators are applied, respectively. Therefore, these sections of code should be identified as relevant.",
