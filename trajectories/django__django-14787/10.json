Specifically, the issue arises when the function passed to the decorator is a partial object and lacks attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`. The provided search results include code from `django/utils/decorators.py`, which contains the definitions of `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator`. These functions are central to how decorators are applied to methods in Django. The `_multi_decorate` function applies a list of decorators and uses `partial` to bind the method, which could be the source of the issue described. The `method_decorator` function wraps this process and handles the application of the decorator to the method. Both of these functions are likely relevant to addressing the issue, as they deal directly with the application and management of decorators.\n\nTo address the reported issue, it would be important to ensure that the `partial` object created in `_multi_decorate` retains the necessary function attributes. This could be achieved by using `update_wrapper` or `wraps` from the `functools` module to ensure that metadata from the original function is preserved when creating the partial object. The provided code spans in `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator` are directly related to this issue and should be considered for further investigation and potential modification.",
