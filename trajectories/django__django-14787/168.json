This issue can be traced to the `_multi_decorate` function, where the `bound_method` is wrapped using `functools.partial`. To address this, the decorator should ensure that these attributes are correctly updated or propagated. The `_update_method_wrapper` function is likely responsible for ensuring these attributes are correctly updated, but it appears to be insufficient in handling partial objects correctly. Thus, relevant code spans include the definition of `_multi_decorate` and `method_decorator`, as they are central to the implementation of the decorator mechanism. Additionally, the `_update_method_wrapper` function is key to updating the method wrapper, and modifications here would likely be necessary to fix the issue.",
