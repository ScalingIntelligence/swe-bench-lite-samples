This leads to an AttributeError since partial objects lack certain attributes like __name__ and __module__. The provided search results include code from django/utils/decorators.py which contains the implementation of method_decorator and its helper function _multi_decorate. These functions handle the decoration of methods and seem to be directly related to the issue as they involve processing decorators and potentially encountering partial objects. Specifically, the _multi_decorate function uses functools.partial to create a bound method, which could be the source of the problem. However, the current implementation does not seem to handle the preservation of attributes from the original function to the partial object, suggesting this part of the code needs attention. Therefore, these spans are likely relevant to addressing the issue.",
