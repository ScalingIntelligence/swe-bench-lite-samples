Specifically, the `method_decorator` function and its helper functions `_multi_decorate` and `_update_method_wrapper` are likely places where the issue could be addressed. These functions handle the decoration of methods and use `functools.partial` to bind methods to instances, which could be where the attributes are not being preserved correctly. The code spans provided in the search results match the context given in the file context and directly address the issue by showing how the decorators are applied and how attributes are updated.
