The 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' file contains a FunctoolsPartialSerializer class which directly deals with serializing functools.partial objects, suggesting it might be relevant to how partial objects are handled in Django, potentially where the attribute preservation error occurs. The 'django/utils/inspect.py' file contains utility functions that examine functions and methods, which might also be relevant for understanding how method_decorator() should handle such partial objects to preserve their attributes. The span 'FunctoolsPartialSerializer.serialize' from 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py' seems particularly relevant as it deals with the serialization of partial functions, potentially linked to the reported issue.

The issue specifically mentions that the `method_decorator` is used with a partial object, which lacks the expected attributes such as `__name__` and `__module__`. The analysis should focus on code spans where `method_decorator` is defined and used, particularly with `functools.partial`. The search results provide several relevant sections:\n\n1. **django/utils/decorators.py**:\n   - This file contains the definition of `method_decorator` and its internal function `_multi_decorate`, which handles the application of decorators to methods. The use of `functools.partial` within `_multi_decorate` is particularly relevant, as it reflects the scenario described in the issue.\n   - The span `method_decorator` defines the decorator, and the span `_multi_decorate` contains the logic that applies decorators to the method, including the use of `functools.partial`.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/serializer.py**:\n   - This file contains a class `FunctoolsPartialSerializer` that specifically deals with serialization of `functools.partial` objects. Although this class doesn't directly address the issue with `method_decorator`, it provides context on how Django handles `functools.partial` in other parts of the application, possibly influencing how `method_decorator` should treat `functools.partial`.\n\n3. **django/urls/resolvers.py** and **django/db/backends/utils.py**:\n   - These files contain various uses of `functools.partial` and decorators, providing a general context on how partial functions and decorators are used in Django, but they are not directly related to the issue with `method_decorator`.\n\nFrom this analysis, the most relevant code spans to address the issue are found in `django/utils/decorators.py`, specifically the `method_decorator` and `_multi_decorate` spans, as they directly deal with the application of decorators to methods and the use of `functools.partial`.",
