This issue concerns preserving these attributes when using method_decorator(). In the provided search results, the function _multi_decorate is central to understanding and potentially resolving this issue. This function operates by creating a wrapper around the method that applies the decorator. It uses functools.partial to bind the method and then decorates it. The issue might be rooted in how _multi_decorate handles the binding and decoration process. For instance, it doesn't seem to preserve or propagate the attributes of the original method after using partial. The other key function, method_decorator, sets up and applies decorators to methods within a class. The fact that method_decorator leverages _multi_decorate further underscores the relevance of the latter to the issue at hand. Also significant is the line within _multi_decorate where it updates the wrapper using update_wrapper. This action is intended to preserve the metadata of the original method, suggesting a direct link to the issue. The presence of these functions in the code makes them highly relevant to the reported issue, as changes needed to resolve the AttributeError are likely to occur in these areas.",
