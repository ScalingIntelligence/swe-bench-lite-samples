The core functionality related to route registration and blueprint handling is spread across several files such as 'cli.py', 'blueprints.py', and 'app.py'. The initial scan suggests that the necessary modifications might involve changes to the 'routes_command' in 'cli.py' to include subdomain data, which can be derived from the 'Blueprint' objects registered in 'app.py'. Additional insights might be needed to fully understand how subdomains are managed within the Flask application, possibly through closer inspection of 'blueprints.py' and how subdomains are defined in 'app.py'.",

The reported issue specifically mentions the need to see which routes are assigned to which subdomains. This involves examining how routes are registered and how subdomains are specified when registering blueprints. The key elements to look for include methods related to adding URL rules, registering blueprints, and iterating over blueprints to gather route information. The search results provide several relevant spans that touch on these aspects:\n\n1. 'Flask.register_blueprint' and 'Flask.iter_blueprints' in 'src/flask/app.py' are crucial as they deal directly with blueprint registration and iteration, which are central to understanding route-subdomain association.\n2. 'BlueprintSetupState.add_url_rule' in 'src/flask/blueprints.py' is significant because it shows how URL rules are added with consideration for the subdomain.\n3. 'Blueprint.register' and 'Blueprint.add_url_rule' in 'src/flask/blueprints.py' further elaborate on the registration process and how rules are added, which is relevant for identifying subdomain configurations.\n4. The 'routes_command' in 'src/flask/cli.py' is interesting as it currently only sorts and displays routes but does not differentiate them by subdomains. This suggests a potential extension to include subdomain information in the command's output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the provided code spans do contain relevant segments for addressing the issue, particularly those involving blueprint registration and URL rule management in the context of subdomains.",
