The relevant code sections are likely to be found in files where routes and blueprints are defined and processed. The `routes_command` function in `cli.py` is a good starting point as it is responsible for displaying the routes. Additionally, the `Blueprint` and `Flask` classes in `blueprints.py` and `app.py` respectively, will likely have methods related to subdomain registration and handling. Searching for these specific parts of the codebase should help in understanding how subdomains are currently managed and where improvements can be made.",
