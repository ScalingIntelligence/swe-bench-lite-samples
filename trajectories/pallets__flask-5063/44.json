The search results provided include relevant code spans from `src/flask/cli.py` and `src/flask/blueprints.py` that could be used to address this issue. Specifically, the `cli.py` file contains the implementation of the `FlaskGroup`, `routes_command`, and `ScriptInfo` classes, which are crucial for the Flask CLI. The `routes_command` function iterates over the application's URL rules and displays them, but currently lacks the subdomain information. The `blueprints.py` file defines the `Blueprint` class and its registration process, which includes the `subdomain` attribute. This attribute could be used to include subdomain information in the route display. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on would be those in the `routes_command` function in `cli.py` and the `Blueprint` class in `blueprints.py` to integrate the subdomain attribute into the route display.",
