The current Flask routes command does not indicate which routes are assigned to which subdomains. The key elements to look for in the code are methods and classes related to route registration, specifically where subdomains are set and how routes are iterated and displayed. The search results provided include the Blueprint and BlueprintSetupState classes, which are relevant as they deal with the registration of blueprints and routes, including subdomains. The BlueprintSetupState.add_url_rule method is particularly important as it sets the subdomain for routes. Additionally, the routes_command method in the cli.py file is relevant for how routes are currently displayed, indicating that modifications here would be necessary to include subdomain information in the output. After analyzing the provided code and search results, it is evident that the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.

The provided context indicates that the `routes_command` in the `cli.py` file is central to the route listing functionality. However, this command currently lacks the capability to display subdomain information. Further examination of the `Blueprint` class in `blueprints.py` and its `register` method reveals that subdomain configurations are set during the initialization of a blueprint and passed during the registration process.
