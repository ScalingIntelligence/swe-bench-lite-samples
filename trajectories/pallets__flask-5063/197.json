Currently, the 'flask routes' command only shows endpoints, methods, and rules but lacks the ability to display which routes are assigned to which subdomains. The feature request is for the command to show a column indicating the domain for each route. To address this, we need to identify code spans related to the Flask application's routing system and the 'flask routes' command. The search results include several relevant code spans: 1. In 'src/flask/app.py', the 'Flask.iter_blueprints' method is relevant to iterate over blueprints, which can be used to find subdomains. 2. In 'src/flask/cli.py', the 'routes_command' function handles the 'flask routes' command and is where route details are formatted and displayed. 3. In 'src/flask/blueprints.py', the '__init__' method of the 'Blueprint' class initializes blueprints with subdomain information. Additionally, the 'register_blueprint' and 'register' methods handle the registration of blueprints, which involves setting up subdomains. These code spans are identified as relevant based on how they contribute to creating and managing routes within the Flask application and the CLI that display these routes. By focusing on these spans, it will be possible to update the 'flask routes' command or create a new method to retrieve and display the subdomain information for each route.",
