This requires modifying how routes are displayed or collected.\n\nCurrently, the 'flask routes' command identifies and lists all registered routes across the application, but it lacks the capability to show which subdomain each route is associated with. This functionality is essential for better understanding the routing configuration in a multi-subdomain environment.\n\nThe potential points of modification in the Flask codebase involve the 'routes_command' function in 'src/flask/cli.py', which is responsible for displaying the routes, and the 'add_url_rule' methods in 'src/flask/blueprints.py' and 'src/flask/app.py', which are used to register routes. These methods were identified for having logic that could associate routes with subdomains.\n\nTo implement the feature, it's necessary to modify the 'routes_command' to fetch subdomain information for each route. This could be achieved by extending the Rule class or the methods that add URL rules to also record subdomain information, making it available for the CLI command. Additionally, it might involve changes to how BlueprintSetupState handles the registration of routes with subdomains.\n\nIt's also noted that the current context includes significant code spans that handle the registration and definition of URL rules, which are foundational for the logic that will need updating. Specifically, the 'Blueprint.add_url_rule' and 'Flask.add_url_rule' methods should potentially be reviewed and possibly modified to include subdomain data in a way that it can be accessed later for display by the 'routes_command'. Understanding how subdomains are currently set (through 'subdomain' parameter in Blueprint creation and registration) will guide where new functionality could be integrated to track this data.\n\nOverall, the solution will likely require adding a new attribute or method to collect and store subdomain data for each route at the time of its registration, and then displaying this collected data within the 'routes_command'.",

The current implementation of `flask routes` only shows endpoint, methods, and rule, but does not include subdomain information. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the registration and storage of routes, particularly those related to subdomains. \n\nFrom the provided code spans, the following are relevant:\n1. `BlueprintSetupState.add_url_rule` in `blueprints.py` handles the addition of URL rules, including the setting of subdomains.\n2. `Flask.register_blueprint` in `app.py` is responsible for registering blueprints, which can have associated subdomains.\n3. `Flask.add_url_rule` in `app.py` adds URL rules to the application, potentially including subdomain information.\n4. `routes_command` in `cli.py` currently displays the routes but does not include subdomain information. This is where the enhancement needs to be made.\n\nThese spans are crucial for understanding how subdomains are incorporated into routes and how we can modify the `routes_command` to display them. The `Blueprint` class and its methods in `blueprints.py` also contain relevant code spans that could be useful for further understanding the registration and handling of blueprints and their subdomains.",
