This involves modifying the existing `routes_command` in `flask.cli` to include the subdomain information in the output. Additionally, it requires understanding how subdomains are managed within Flask, which is primarily done through the `Blueprint` class in `flask.blueprints` and the `Flask` class in `flask.app`. The current `routes_command` does not display subdomain information, and this is the main discrepancy that needs to be addressed. By examining the `Blueprint.register` method, it's evident how blueprints with subdomains are registered with the application. To implement the feature request, modifications to the `routes_command` are necessary to extract and display subdomain information from the `url_map`, which is managed by the `Flask` class and its associated blueprints. The `Flask.add_url_rule` method is key to understanding how routes are added to the application, including potential subdomain configurations. The identified spans provide the necessary context to start implementing this feature, but actual implementation would involve digging deeper into how subdomain information is stored and accessed within Flask's URL mapping and blueprint registration systems.",
