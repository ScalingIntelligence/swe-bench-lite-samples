The key points from the issue are:\n\n- Ability to view routes along with their subdomains.\n- The example provided shows a desired output format that includes the domain in the 'flask routes' command output.\n\nFrom the given file context, the focus is on the Blueprint and Flask classes which are central to defining and registering routes and subdomains. The key methods observed are:\n\n- `Blueprint.__init__`: Initializes a blueprint with parameters including `subdomain`.\n- `Blueprint.register`: Registers the blueprint to an app, which is crucial for the app to know about the subdomain.\n- `Blueprint.register_blueprint`: For registering nested blueprints, which might also handle subdomains.\n- `Flask.register_blueprint`: Registers a blueprint to the Flask app.\n\nFor the search results, the focus shifts to the CLI commands related to routes, specifically in `src/flask/cli.py` where the `routes_command` function is defined. This function currently lists the routes but does not display the subdomain information.\n\nRelevant code spans to consider for implementing the feature request based on the analysis:\n\n1. `Blueprint` class and its methods, especially those dealing with subdomain configuration and registration.\n2. `routes_command` function in `src/flask/cli.py` for potential modifications to display subdomain information.\n\nGiven these points, I will select the most relevant spans that could be directly modified or referenced to implement the feature.",
