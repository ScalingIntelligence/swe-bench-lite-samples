Currently, the command only shows the endpoint, methods, and rule but does not indicate which subdomain each route is associated with. The relevant code spans analyzed include the 'routes_command' function in 'cli.py', which is responsible for displaying the routes. The function iterates over the rules of the current app's URL map and prints each rule's endpoint, methods, and rule. To address the issue, modifications would be needed within this function to extract and display the subdomain for each rule. Additionally, the 'Blueprint' class in 'blueprints.py' is related, as it handles the registration of blueprints with subdomains, which are the concern of this issue. The 'register' method of the 'Blueprint' class would be relevant, particularly where the subdomain is set during the registration process. This would help in understanding how subdomains are associated with routes but does not directly contribute to the immediate display issue addressed in the 'routes_command'.",
