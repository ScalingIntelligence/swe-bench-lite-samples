The current implementation sorts and displays routes based on criteria like 'endpoint', 'methods', 'rule', or 'match'. The function `routes_command` iterates over the `url_map` of the current application to gather route information. Each route is represented as a `Rule` object, which contains attributes like `endpoint`, `methods`, and `rule`. To include subdomain information, we need to modify this function to extract and display the subdomain from each rule. The necessary subdomain information is available in the `Rule` objects, specifically in the `_options` dictionary, which is populated when a rule is added with a subdomain through blueprints. We will need to access this dictionary to retrieve and display the subdomain alongside other route details.",
