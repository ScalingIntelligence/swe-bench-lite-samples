This is crucial for understanding the mapping between routes and subdomains in a Flask application. The provided search results contain several relevant files and code spans that can guide in either fixing the current `routes` command or implementing a new method to achieve the desired functionality. \n\nFirstly, in `src/flask/cli.py`, the `routes_command` function clearly shows how the current `flask routes` output is generated. The function iterates over the rules in the application's URL map and prints out the endpoint, methods, and rule. This is where the enhancement would need to be made to also include the subdomain information. Additionally, the `FlaskGroup` class and its `__init__` method, which includes the `routes_command`, are relevant as any changes to how routes are displayed will likely need to update this command.\n\nSecondly, in `src/flask/blueprints.py`, the `Blueprint` class and its `__init__` method are crucial for understanding how subdomains are defined and registered within blueprints. The `register` method shows how blueprints are registered with an application, including handling of subdomains. This file will be important for ensuring any new functionality respects how blueprints, and thus subdomains, are implemented in Flask.\n\nBased on these findings, the identified code spans are relevant not only for understanding the current state of route and subdomain management in Flask but also for planning and implementing the feature request to enhance the `flask routes` command with subdomain information.",
