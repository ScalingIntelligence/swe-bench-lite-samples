Currently, the 'routes_command' function in 'src/flask/cli.py' handles the output of the routes, but it does not include subdomain information. The relevant code spans are those that define and implement the 'routes_command'. These spans define how routes are collected and displayed, but they need to be updated to incorporate subdomain information. The search results confirm the existence of the 'routes_command' and its implementation, which is essential for addressing the issue. Since the subdomain information is not directly available in the current implementation, additional code changes will be necessary to extract and display this information. The task is not complete as the current implementation does not address the feature request to include subdomain information in the 'flask routes' output.",

This function iterates over the rules of the current application's URL map and formats them for display in the CLI. To include subdomain information in the route listing, modifications are needed within this function to extract and display the subdomain from each rule. The subdomain information can be derived from the Blueprint registration, which is likely stored in the rule's blueprint attribute. Further, the Flask `Blueprint` class and its registration process should also be explored to understand how subdomains are associated with routes.",
