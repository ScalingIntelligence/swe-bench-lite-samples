'Flask.register_blueprint': This method registers a blueprint with the app, which includes options for setting the subdomain. This is crucial for understanding how subdomains are associated with routes.\n2. 'Flask.iter_blueprints': This method iterates over all registered blueprints, which could be useful for programmatically inspecting each blueprint's routes and subdomains.\n3. 'Flask.create_url_adapter': This method creates a URL adapter that binds the URL map to the request environment, handling subdomain matching. This is essential for understanding how subdomains are factored into URL routing.\n4. 'Request.blueprint': This property retrieves the blueprint of the current request, which might be used to infer the associated subdomain in a request context.\n\nThese spans provide a comprehensive view of how Flask handles blueprints, routes, and subdomains, and should be sufficient for addressing the feature request of displaying subdomains alongside routes.",
