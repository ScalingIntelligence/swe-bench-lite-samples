The task identifies relevant code spans related to managing routes and subdomains in the Flask framework, particularly focusing on how blueprints are registered and how routes are added with subdomain options.\n\n1. Analyzing User Instructions:\n   The issue demands a feature enhancement in the 'flask routes' command to include subdomain information. This requires understanding where and how subdomains and routes are configured and registered, especially in relation to blueprints.\n\n2. Reviewing Current Context:\n   The current context provides insights into how the Flask app and blueprints manage subdomains and routes. Key elements mentioned are the 'SERVER_NAME' configuration and the way blueprints are registered with subdomains.\n\n3. Processing New Search Results:\n   a. 'BlueprintSetupState.add_url_rule': This method sets the subdomain for a rule when adding it. It's crucial for understanding how subdomains get included in route definitions.\n   b. 'Blueprint' and 'Flask.register_blueprint': These methods are fundamental in handling how blueprints are registered with specific subdomains. They provide context on how subdomains and routes interact with each other.\n   c. 'Flask.add_url_rule': This method is responsible for adding routes to the Flask app. It will show how routes are defined without explicitly addressing subdomains, adding value in understanding the basics of route handling.\n   d. 'routes_command' in 'cli.py': This is directly related to the 'flask routes' command, showing how routes are currently displayed. It's useful for figuring out where and how to integrate subdomain information.\n\nConsidering these points, these code spans are relevant to the feature request as they touch on the core functionalities required for implementing subdomain display in route listings.",
