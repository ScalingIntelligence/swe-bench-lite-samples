Specifically, the BlueprintSetupState class and the add_url_rule method in the Blueprint class are places where subdomain information is accessible. However, this information currently isn't utilized in the 'routes_command' function in the Flask CLI module, which only gathers and displays the routes without subdomain information. The challenge lies in the need to enhance this function to access the subdomain data from each BlueprintSetupState instance and display it when listing endpoints. Given the current setup, it appears necessary to modify the 'routes_command' function or create either a new function or a helper function to handle route gathering, extending it with subdomain information. Following the search strategy in JSON, focus on altering or supplementing the 'routes_command' to integrate subdomain information.",

The issue specifically requests a feature where the `flask routes` command outputs not just the routes but also the subdomains they are assigned to. The search results include a significant portion of the `cli.py` file, which contains the implementation of the `routes_command` function. This function is responsible for displaying the registered routes of the Flask application and aligning closely with the feature request. \n\nThe function `routes_command` could potentially be enhanced to include subdomain information as part of its output. This involves accessing rule-related data that includes subdomains, possibly from the `url_map` maintained by the Flask application. Given that the current implementation already sorts and displays routes based on user input, it seems feasible to extend this functionality to incorporate subdomain details. Furthermore, the presence of blueprints and their registration in `blueprints.py` and `app.py` suggests that blueprints are indeed managed with subdomains. \n\nThese code spans seem to address the core of the reported issue by focusing on where subdomain information would be processed and displayed in a Flask application's context using the `routes_command`.
