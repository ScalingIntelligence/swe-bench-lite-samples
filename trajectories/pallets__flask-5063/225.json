This information is crucial for understanding which routes are assigned to which subdomains. The current implementation of 'flask routes' in 'cli.py' shows routes but lacks subdomain information. The 'Blueprint' class in 'blueprints.py' handles the registration of blueprints with subdomains, and the 'BlueprintSetupState' class has a method 'add_url_rule' that includes the 'subdomain' parameter when adding a URL rule. This method is likely where the subdomain information could be extracted and displayed in the 'flask routes' output. Additionally, the 'Flask' class in 'app.py' also has an 'add_url_rule' method that could be relevant for this feature. The 'routes_command' function in 'cli.py' iterates over the rules and prints out the endpoint, methods, and rule, but it lacks subdomain information. Thus, the relevant code spans to address this issue include the 'add_url_rule' method in both 'Blueprint' and 'Flask' classes and the 'routes_command' function in 'cli.py'.",
