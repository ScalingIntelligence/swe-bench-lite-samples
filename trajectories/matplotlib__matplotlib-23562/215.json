However, in the initial review, it appeared that these colors are assigned based on the depth sorting of the 3D segments. The code carefully sorts the segments by their depth and assigns colors to the 2D versions accordingly. Given this, an issue arises if there are segments with no depth (empty segments), leading to empty arrays for '_facecolors2d'. This zero-length edge case handling ensures that '_facecolors2d' and '_edgecolors2d' are always defined, even if the array is empty.",
