This error occurs in the 'art3d.py' file when calling the 'get_facecolors' method. To resolve this, we need to identify where in the codebase the '_facecolors2d' attribute should be set or referenced. \n\nFrom the search results, the 'art3d.py' file contains the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its '__init__' method, which initializes several attributes but does not directly initialize '_facecolors2d'. Additionally, the file includes a 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function that converts a 2D collection to 3D, but this function also does not directly address '_facecolors2d'. \n\nFurthermore, the 'axes3d.py' file contains the 'Axes3D' class, which includes the 'plot_surface' method used to create a 3D surface plot. This method uses 'Poly3DCollection' and potentially involves setting face colors. Since the error occurs in the context of creating a surface plot, this part of the code is highly relevant.\n\nGiven the information, the relevant code spans appear to be those involving the 'Poly3DCollection' class and the 'plot_surface' method, as they directly relate to the functionality where the error arises. Identifying these spans in the codebase is crucial for further debugging and resolving the reported issue.",
