This aligns with the error traceback that points specifically to 'Poly3DCollection' not having '_facecolors2d' within the 'get_facecolors' method in art3d.py. From the search results and existing context, significant portions of the code related to 'Poly3DCollection' are present across various methods and attributes. These include the constructor '__init__', methods for handling Z-sorting, vector properties, 3D projection, face and edge color management, and conversion from 2D to 3D collections. Notably, the 'Poly3DCollection' class defines methods like 'set_facecolor', 'set_edgecolor', and 'set_alpha', suggesting strong correlation with the handling of colors and transparency attributes. The relevant code spans should thus cover these methods. Additionally, since the issue involves missing 2D face colors in a 3D collection object, the 'get_facecolors' method within 'Poly3DCollection' should be further examined, along with its inherent attributes and dependencies. It's vital to ensure all sections of the code that might influence or be influenced by color management are taken into account, particularly focusing on potential discrepancies or omissions in the attributes '_facecolors2d' and '_facecolor3d'. This detailed scrutiny should help pinpoint the source of the attribute error, matching it against the reported issue.",
