The relevant code that initializes this class is found in the 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py' file, specifically in the 'Poly3DCollection.__init__' span. The 'plot_surface' method in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py', which utilizes 'Poly3DCollection', is also identified as relevant due to its responsibility of creating and managing 3D polygons.
