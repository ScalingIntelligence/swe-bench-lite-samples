Upon examining the code spans provided in the search results, it appears that the attribute '_facecolors2d' should be assigned during the 'do_3d_projection' method, where it is populated from '_facecolor3d' after sorting by depth. This suggests that the issue arises if 'do_3d_projection' has not been called or has not been able to complete its tasks for some reason, leading to the missing attribute. The identified spans include the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition and its methods, specifically focusing on 'do_3d_projection', 'set_facecolor', and 'get_facecolor' which are directly related to handling face colors in 3D space.
