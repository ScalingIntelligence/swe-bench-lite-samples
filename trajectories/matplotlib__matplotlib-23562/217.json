This suggests that the attribute might not be initialized or inherited correctly. The current context shows that 'Poly3DCollection' inherits from 'PolyCollection'. The search results show the 'PolyCollection' class definition which 'Poly3DCollection' should inherit from. By examining the 'PolyCollection' class, it can be seen that it does not explicitly initialize '_facecolors2d'. Therefore, the relevant code spans to investigate further would be those relating to the initialization and properties of 'PolyCollection' and how 'Poly3DCollection' inherits these properties.\n\nSince 'Poly3DCollection' is derived from 'PolyCollection', it's essential to inspect any overrides or additional setup in 'Poly3DCollection' that might affect the inheritance of '_facecolors2d'. This analysis suggests that the issue could be related to how 'Poly3DCollection' inherits or overrides the properties of 'PolyCollection'.
