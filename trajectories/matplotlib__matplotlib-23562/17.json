By examining the search results, it is clear that the 'Poly3DCollection' class is indeed present in the 'art3d.py' file, and it includes methods such as '__init__' and 'set_facecolor'. However, the specific error points to a missing attribute '_facecolors2d' which is likely related to how face colors are managed or retrieved in the class. The provided code spans do not directly address the '_facecolors2d' attribute or the 'get_facecolors' method. Therefore, based on the information available in the search results, it appears that the code spans provided are relevant to the class but do not directly resolve the issue of the missing attribute.
