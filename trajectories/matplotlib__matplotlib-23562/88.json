This indicates that the attribute might not be properly initialized or assigned within the class methods. \n\nReviewing the provided search results, I noticed that the 'Poly3DCollection' class does not explicitly assign a '_facecolors2d' attribute in its methods. However, the 'do_3d_projection' method contains logic that assigns to '_facecolors2d' based on the depth sorting of the faces. This suggests that the issue might be related to the order of operations or conditions under which '_facecolors2d' is set. \n\nGiven the traceback and the minimal example provided, it appears that the '_facecolors2d' attribute is accessed before it is assigned a value. This could happen if the 'do_3d_projection' method is not called, or if the conditions for setting '_facecolors2d' are not met. \n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code spans would include the initialization and setting of properties in the 'Poly3DCollection' class, particularly the 'do_3d_projection' method, which is where '_facecolors2d' is conditionally assigned. Additionally, the 'get_facecolor' method directly accesses '_facecolors2d' without checking if it exists, which might also need to be revised to handle cases where '_facecolors2d' is not yet assigned.",
