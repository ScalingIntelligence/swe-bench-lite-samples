This error is encountered when calling 'get_facecolors()' on a 'Poly3DCollection' object, suggesting that the attribute '_facecolors2d' might not be defined or has been removed in the versions being tested (mpl versions 1.3.1 and 1.4.2). To identify the relevant code spans, we need to focus on the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, particularly those related to face colors and attributes. Additionally, we should look at the 'Axes3D' class, especially the 'plot_surface' method, as this is where the 'Poly3DCollection' object is instantiated and manipulated. From the provided search results, the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition, its '__init__' method, and the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function are relevant as they deal with the initialization and transformation of 3D collections. The 'Axes3D.plot_surface' method is also relevant as it creates an instance of 'Poly3DCollection' and sets its attributes. These code spans provide the necessary context to understand how face colors are managed and where the '_facecolors2d' attribute might be missing.",
