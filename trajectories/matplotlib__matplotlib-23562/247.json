This class is a subclass of 'PolyCollection' and includes methods and attributes relevant to 3D polygon collections, which aligns with the context of the error. The relevant spans of code for investigating this issue are the class definition of 'Poly3DCollection' and its '__init__' method, as these define the object's attributes and behaviors. The method 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' is also noteworthy as it transforms a 2D collection into a 3D collection, possibly relevant to the attribute issue.

This issue is related to the handling of face colors in 3D plots in Matplotlib. Analyzing the provided context and search results, it's clear that the issue arises in the `do_3d_projection` method of the `Poly3DCollection` class, where the `_facecolors2d` attribute is expected to be set, but apparently isn't.\n\nFrom the search results, it appears that the `_facecolors2d` attribute is indeed used in the `do_3d_projection` method of `Poly3DCollection`. This method is crucial for sorting the 3D polygons by depth and mapping their colors appropriately into 2D space for rendering. The redefinition of the `get_facecolor` method within `Poly3DCollection` also seems to be at fault, as it directly accesses `_facecolors2d`. There seems to be a chain of attribute references and setups in the `Poly3DCollection.set_facecolor`, `Poly3DCollection.set_3d_properties`, and `Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection` that are critical for handling the face colors correctly.\n\nThe provided search results do not inherently indicate more configuration errors or additional types or classes that might relate further, but they do suggest that the issue's origin seems well-covered in the listed code spans. The presence of code that explicitly deals with initialization, re-projection, and depth sorting for objects like `Poly3DCollection` gives evidence of handling the issue at its core.\n\nTherefore, these code spans should suffice for tackling the reported issue since they include essential methods and properties related to managing 3D polygonal objects and their colors in Matplotlib.",
