The search results include the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition and its initialization method, as well as the 'Axes3D.plot_surface' method which creates a 'Poly3DCollection' object.

While the context provides the initialization of `Poly3DCollection` and its usage within the `Axes3D` class methods like `plot_surface`, it does not explicitly include the implementation of the `get_facecolors` method that is causing the issue. The actual line in the traceback points to this method's attempt to access a non-existing attribute `_facecolors2d`, which is a clear indicator that the method implementation is missing or possibly incorrect in the current version. The methods like `_shade_colors` that interact with face colors and might be involved in shading computations are provided, which could be indirectly related to the issue by affecting how face colors are managed or retrieved. Additionally, the `plot_surface` method shows how `Poly3DCollection` instances are created and managed, suggesting a place where modifications might be needed to either correct or add the missing functionality related to face colors. Despite not having a direct view of 'get_facecolors', the context provides enough information to deduce that this method and likely some form of initialization or updating of `_facecolors2d` is what's missing and needs to be investigated.",

This suggests that the class Poly3DCollection in the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d module is missing or incorrectly implemented the '_facecolors2d' attribute, which is likely needed for handling face colors in 3D plots. Both the current file context and the new search results show the definition of Poly3DCollection and its __init__ method, as well as the function poly_collection_2d_to_3d which might be relevant to converting 2D collections to 3D. The Axes3D class and its methods like plot_surface and _shade_colors are also present, which are likely used for rendering 3D surfaces. Given that the issue pertains to the missing attribute '_facecolors2d', the relevant code spans are those associated with the Poly3DCollection class and its methods, as these sections are directly related to the functionality where the error occurs. The search results and file context both provide the same sections of the Poly3DCollection class, indicating that we have a complete view of the potentially relevant code.
