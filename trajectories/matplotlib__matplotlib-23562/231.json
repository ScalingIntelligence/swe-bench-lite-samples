While this specific file is not included in the search results, the relevance of the 'Axes3D' class in 'axes3d.py' is apparent as it is directly related to 3D plotting and contains the 'plot_surface' method, which is used in the minimal example provided. This method is responsible for creating 'Poly3DCollection' objects, which aligns with the error context from the traceback. Examining the 'plot_surface' method within the 'Axes3D' class reveals that it handles the creation and manipulation of 'Poly3DCollection' objects, including setting face colors.
