By analyzing the provided search results from 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py', it's evident that the relevant class is 'Poly3DCollection'. This class inherits from 'PolyCollection' and is used to handle 3D polygons specifically. Notably, it redefines several methods critical for displaying 3D graphics, but it does not directly address the '_facecolors2d' attribute. The focus spans should be on 'Poly3DCollection' and its associated methods that might interface with face color attributes to find a resolution or further trace problematic code. Hence, 'Poly3DCollection' initialization and method handling are likely fruitful areas to investigate further.",

After analyzing the provided file context and search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans involve the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition and its methods. Specifically, the method 'get_facecolors()' is attempting to access the attribute '_facecolors2d', which it expects to exist based on its implementation. The provided search results include further methods within the 'Poly3DCollection' class that manage color attributes such as 'set_facecolor', 'set_edgecolor', and 'set_alpha'. These methods seem to handle various other color attributes but do not directly address the missing '_facecolors2d'. Additionally, the 'Axes3D' class methods 'plot_surface', 'plot_trisurf', and 'add_collection3d' have been provided which might be related to the use of 'Poly3DCollection' in a 3D plotting context. However, the direct cause appears rooted within 'Poly3DCollection'. It is recommended to focus on the 'Poly3DCollection' class to find where and why '_facecolors2d' should be defined or updated to avoid the reported AttributeError.",
