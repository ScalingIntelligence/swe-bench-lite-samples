This is likely due to the method 'get_facecolors' not being implemented or overridden correctly in the 'Poly3DCollection' class. The search results provide the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its '__init__' method. The class inherits from 'PolyCollection' but does not explicitly define the 'get_facecolors' method. Additionally, the method 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' is found, which transforms a 2D collection to a 3D collection. This method might be relevant if the issue is related to transforming collections. To address the issue, it would be important to check if 'get_facecolors' or '_facecolors2d' are defined in 'PolyCollection' and if they're being correctly accessed or overridden in 'Poly3DCollection'. Given the provided code spans, the most relevant part is within the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition, specifically where it might be missing the attribute '_facecolors2d' or where the 'get_facecolors' method should be defined or overridden.",
