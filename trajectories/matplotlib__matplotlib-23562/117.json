Notably, the 'set_facecolor' method updates '_facecolor3d' but does not mention '_facecolors2d'. This suggests that the absence of '_facecolors2d' might be related to how face colors are being managed in this class. To address the issue, it would be relevant to check how '_facecolors2d' should be initialized and used in 'Poly3DCollection', as well as whether any other part of the code assigns values to this attribute. The identified spans underscore the areas to look into for debugging or implementing a fix, including checking and enhancing how face colors are set and accessed.",

This issue is demonstrated by a minimal example and a traceback pointing to the specific line in the `art3d.py` file causing the problem. The provided file context and search results both include the `Poly3DCollection` class and its methods. Analyzing the new search results, particularly the extensive definition of `Poly3DCollection`, reveals that the `do_3d_projection` method attempts to sort and project 3D faces to 2D but may not be assigning the `_facecolors2d` attribute correctly. Additionally, the `set_3d_properties` method initializes `_facecolor3d` but overlooks initializing `_facecolors2d`. The identified spans include the `Poly3DCollection` definition and related methods that directly manage or should manage face colors and 3D properties. These findings suggest that the issue likely arises from incomplete or improper initialization of the `_facecolors2d` attribute. Therefore, the relevant code spans in the search results should include those methods within the `Poly3DCollection` class that deal with setting, getting, and projecting face colors, as well as methods responsible for initializing 3D properties.",
