The error suggests that the '_facecolors2d' attribute is missing, which is used in the 'get_facecolors' method. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the 'get_facecolors' method of the 'Poly3DCollection' class. To diagnose and fix this issue, we need to focus on the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, especially 'get_facecolors' and any related attribute assignments or initializations. Also, considering the versions of Matplotlib used (1.3.1 and 1.4.2), it might be helpful to look for any version-specific changes or bug fixes that could relate to this attribute.",

Upon reviewing the search results, it is clear that the issue most likely lies within the 'Poly3DCollection' class in the file 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py'. This class is defined in the provided code, but it does not contain the attribute '_facecolors2d' which is causing the error in the minimal example provided. In order to resolve this issue, one would need to modify or add the 'get_facecolors' method and potentially other related methods within the 'Poly3DCollection' class to include the missing attribute '_facecolors2d' or provide a different implementation to avoid the need for this attribute. Additionally, the method 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' should be reviewed as it directly interacts with a collection object that gets converted to 'Poly3DCollection', potentially affecting how face colors are handled. Further analysis is needed to determine the exact changes required, but the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

This suggests that the method 'get_facecolors' is relying on an attribute that hasn't been properly initialized or handled in the Poly3DCollection class. When analyzing the current context and new search results, key spans in Poly3DCollection involving color handling, specifically '_facecolors2d', '_facecolor3d', and 'get_facecolor', caught attention. By examining these spans, I identified the issue lies within the 'do_3D_projection' method, bounding on translations of vector transactions into a 2D-drawn environment, which likely leads to the AttributeError due to the sequence of these operations. So, spans relating to the construction, properties handling, and antiferromagnetic projection setting up of Poly3DCollection are marked relevant to better understand and fix this attribute issue.",
