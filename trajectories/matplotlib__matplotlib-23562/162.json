The search results provide the full class definition of 'Poly3DCollection' in 'art3d.py', which is relevant because it contains the method 'get_facecolor' that attempts to access '_facecolors2d'. This class definition is essential for understanding and resolving the issue. The spans 'Poly3DCollection.get_facecolor' and 'Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection' are particularly relevant as they directly deal with color and projection attributes that are likely to be involved in the error. Additionally, 'Poly3DCollection.set_facecolor' and 'Poly3DCollection.set_edgecolor' could be related to managing colors, which might be where '_facecolors2d' should be set or managed. Given the thorough review of the provided code, it seems clear that these spans are pertinent to the issue at hand, and further inspection of the entire section should help in diagnosing and possibly resolving the reported problem.",
