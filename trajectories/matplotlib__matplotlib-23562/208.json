The traceback shows that the error occurs in the `get_facecolors` method of `Poly3DCollection`. Upon analyzing the provided search results, it is evident that the source of the error lies within this class definition in the file 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py'. Specifically, the method `get_facecolors` directly accesses `self._facecolors2d`, which is not defined within the class, leading to the AttributeError. Additionally, the methods `set_facecolor` and `set_edgecolor` are relevant as they interact with the face and edge colors, respectively, which might be related to the `_facecolors2d` attribute. The function `do_3d_projection` is also significant as it handles the 3D projection and sorting of the polygons, which could impact how face colors are managed. Therefore, these spans of code are crucial for understanding and resolving the reported issue concerning the `_facecolors2d` attribute.",

The 'Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection' method handles the 3D projection, sorting by depth, and setting 2D face and edge colors.\n3. The 'Poly3DCollection.set_facecolor' and 'Poly3DCollection.set_edgecolor' methods update the face and edge colors respectively.\n4. The 'Poly3DCollection.get_facecolor' and 'Poly3DCollection.get_edgecolor' methods are supposed to return the 2D face and edge colors, but the error indicates these might not be set or accessed correctly.\n\nOther methods like 'set_zsort', 'get_vector', 'set_verts', 'set_verts_and_codes', 'set_3d_properties', 'set_sort_zpos', 'set_alpha' provide additional functionality related to how the 3D collection is handled but do not directly address the missing '_facecolors2d' attribute.\n\nGiven the context and search results, the relevant code spans are those that deal with initializing, projecting, setting, and getting face and edge colors.
