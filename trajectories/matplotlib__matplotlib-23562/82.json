The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the 'get_facecolors' method of the 'Poly3DCollection' class in the 'art3d.py' file. This suggests a problem in how the 'Poly3DCollection' class is handling face colors, particularly in 3D plots. The minimal example provided uses 'plot_surface' from the 'Axes3D' class in 'axes3d.py', indicating that the issue might be related to the interaction between these two classes when plotting surfaces. Given the detailed traceback and the minimal example, it seems that the key areas to investigate are the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods in 'art3d.py', as well as any methods in 'axes3d.py' that involve surface plotting and face color handling.",

This error occurs when trying to access `r.get_facecolors()` after creating a surface plot. The traceback points to the file lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py where the 'Poly3DCollection' class is defined. Additionally, there is a function 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' in the same file that might be relevant. In the search results, two main files are identified: 'art3d.py' contains the definition of 'Poly3DCollection' and the purported function 'get_facecolors', which raises the AttributeError due to the missing '_facecolors2d' attribute. The 'axes3d.py' file contains the definition of 'Axes3D', which is the class used to create the 3D axes and includes the 'plot_surface' method where the 'Poly3DCollection' object is instantiated. Given the nature of the error, it is likely that either the initialization of 'Poly3DCollection' is incomplete or that the '_facecolors2d' attribute was not appropriately set during the instantiation of the object created by the 'plot_surface' method. Thus, focusing on the code spans related to 'Poly3DCollection' and 'plot_surface' should be sufficient to piece together the necessary codes and identify potential issues in the codebase.",
