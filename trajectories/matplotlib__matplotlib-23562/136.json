The provided search results offer a detailed look into the `Poly3DCollection` class, including its `__init__` method and `do_3d_projection` method. The `do_3d_projection` method seems to be responsible for handling the transformation and sorting of 3D vertices and their colors, particularly setting `self._facecolors2d` and `self._edgecolors2d`. Since the issue involves the absence of `_facecolors2d`, focusing on this class and this method is essential. The analysis of the provided code confirms that `self._facecolors2d` is assigned within the `do_3d_projection` method under certain conditions, specifically after sorting by depth. This method is relevant to address the issue because it sets up the 2D face colors for the 3D collection, which aligns with the error message indicating the missing attribute '_facecolors2d'.

Examination of the 'Poly3DCollection' class in the provided file context shows that '_facecolors2d' is indeed a managed attribute, set during the execution of the 'do_3d_projection' method. This method handles the projection from 3D to 2D, and if the process fails to correctly assign '_facecolors2d' due to some unforeseen circumstances or specific inputs, it would result in the reported AttributeError. Additionally, the 'update_scalarmappable' method appears integral for updating color attributes, which are later used in the projection process. Given these findings, it appears that the file context does provide the relevant class and method definitions valid for debugging this issue, hinting at possible logical errors or exceptional cases within the 'do_3d_projection' method.",
