The issue could be that when the method 'get_facecolors' in 'Poly3DCollection' tries to access '_facecolors2d', it finds out it hasn't been set. However, more comprehensive code context around these methods would be necessary for a definitive solution.",

While it horizontally elevates properties for 3D like facecolors and edgecolors by referring to methods like 'set_3d_properties()', it does not explicitly mention '_facecolors2d'. This suggests that the '_facecolors2d' might have been intended to be a placeholder or intermediary state.
