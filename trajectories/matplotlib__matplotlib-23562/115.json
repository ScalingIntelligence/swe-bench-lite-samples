This directly points to the Poly3DCollection class in the provided search results. The initial assessment of the issue suggests that the 'Poly3DCollection' might not be properly initialized or that there's a missing method to handle facecolors in the 3D context. By examining the code spans, we can see that the Poly3DCollection class is indeed defined and inherits from PolyCollection. This class is related to the plot_surface method used in the minimal example, which is where the issue is originating. Furthermore, the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function indicates a conversion process that might be relevant since it involves transforming 2D collections into 3D, which could be related to missing attributes or properties like '_facecolors2d'. Based on this analysis, the relevant spans are those defining the Poly3DCollection class and the transformation function, as they are directly connected to the functionality behind the plot_surface method and the reported attribute error.",

This suggests that the error occurs in the method 'get_facecolor' of the 'Poly3DCollection' class, which is attempting to return '_facecolors2d'. According to the provided file context and search results, it appears that the relevant code spans are primarily in the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition. Notably, 'Poly3DCollection.get_facecolor' attempts to return '_facecolors2d', which is not available. This method and other related methods like 'set_3d_properties', 'do_3d_projection', and initialization ('__init__') should be reviewed to understand why '_facecolors2d' might be missing. It's crucial to ensure that '_facecolors2d' is properly set during the object's lifecycle. Considering the search results, there seems to be an effort to manage and use '_facecolors2d' in methods like 'do_3d_projection', where it's differentiated from '_facecolor3d' and possibly managed, but it's not directly assigned or set up in other methods. Integration of this critical attribute in setup or transformation methods makes the 'Poly3DCollection.set_3d_properties' and 'Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection' very relevant to fix or enhance with respect to '_facecolors2d' management. Thus, the identified spans are likely to help resolve the reported issue.",

This error occurs in the 'get_facecolors' method of the 'Poly3DCollection' class. The provided minimal example and traceback clearly indicate that the error is from an attempt to access '_facecolors2d' which is missing. In the search results, the 'Poly3DCollection' class is re-defined with several methods including 'do_3d_projection', 'set_facecolor', 'set_edgecolor', 'set_alpha', 'get_facecolor', and 'get_edgecolor'. Notably, 'get_facecolor' attempts to return '_facecolors2d' but this attribute is not initialized in any of the methods provided. It is crucial to identify where '_facecolors2d' should be initialized or derived from '_facecolor3d'. Given the extensive context provided, it seems likely that '_facecolors2d' is intended to be derived from '_facecolor3d' during the projection process, but this step appears to be missing in the provided context. I will mark the 'Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection' method as relevant since this is where depth sorting and 2D face color initialization likely should occur. However, this span does not explicitly initialize '_facecolors2d', suggesting a gap in implementation likely related to the reported issue.",

Upon reviewing the provided file context and search results, it is clear that the attribute '_facecolors2d' is indeed missing in the 'Poly3DCollection' class. The relevant sections of code that handle face colors in 'Poly3DCollection' include 'Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection', 'Poly3DCollection.set_facecolor', and 'Poly3DCollection.get_facecolor'. Notably, in the 'do_3d_projection' method, the '_facecolors2d' attribute is set but not initialized in the class's __init__ method or any other method. This omission is likely the cause of the AttributeError. Additionally, the search results provide a comprehensive overview of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, confirming the absence of an explicit initialization or declaration of '_facecolors2d' in the class definition. This analysis indicates that the search task is complete as the relevant code spans have been identified, focusing on the 'Poly3DCollection' class methods dealing with face colors and 3D projection, and the missing attribute '_facecolors2d' has been pinpointed.",
