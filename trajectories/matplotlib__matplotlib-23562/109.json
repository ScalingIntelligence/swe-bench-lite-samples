The traceback points to the function 'get_facecolors' in the 'art3d.py' file where the error occurs. The provided search results contain the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, including 'get_facecolors'. This method is intended to return 'self._facecolors2d', but it is clear from the error that this attribute is missing. Furthermore, the last line of the provided minimal example, 'r.get_facecolors()', is supposed to invoke this method, leading to the error. The analysis of the 'Poly3DCollection' class in the search results reveals that indeed, the attribute '_facecolors2d' is not directly initialized or set within the class methods. There is a method 'do_3d_projection' that sets 'self._facecolors2d' conditionally, but this seems to indicate that the attribute might not always be available depending on the conditions during execution. This analysis suggests that the issue could be due to 'self._facecolors2d' not being set under certain circumstances or that there might be an oversight in the initialization or processing of the 'Poly3DCollection' object. Given this context, the relevant spans of code to address or further investigate this issue would primarily be those within the 'Poly3DCollection' class, including the '__init__', 'do_3d_projection', and 'get_facecolor' methods, as these directly deal with the face colors and their handling in a 3D context.",
