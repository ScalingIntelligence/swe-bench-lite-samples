The provided search results, focused on 'Poly3DCollection' in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py', offer a thorough insight into the class's methods and attributes. Notably, the 'get_facecolor' method directly accesses '_facecolors2d'. This indicates that the relevant code spans to look into are those defining or manipulating '_facecolors2d'. The span 'Poly3DCollection.do_3d_projection' is crucial as it constructs '_facecolors2d' during the 3D projection process. This matches the circumstantial evidence from the error traceback showing the failure during a 3D projection attempt. The additional spans 'Poly3DCollection.set_facecolor' and 'Poly3DCollection.set_alpha' could potentially influence or affect the '_facecolors2d' attribute, making them relevant for understanding the full scope of the issue. The 'Poly3DCollection.__init__' span is also of interest as it sets up the class, though direct relevance to the issue may be indirect compared to the previously mentioned spans.
