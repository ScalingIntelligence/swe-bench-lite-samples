From the given minimal example and the traceback, it is clear that the error occurs in the 'get_facecolors' method of the Poly3DCollection class. The search results provide the code for the Poly3DCollection class, specifically the '__init__' method and a related function 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d'. The '__init__' method initializes the class and sets up the necessary attributes, but it does not set up the '_facecolors2d' attribute. It is plausible that the '_facecolors2d' attribute should be initialized in this method or in a related method. The 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function also interacts with the Poly3DCollection class and might be relevant in understanding how the attribute '_facecolors2d' should be handled.
