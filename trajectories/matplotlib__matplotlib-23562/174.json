This suggests a deficiency in the implementation or a potential bug within the Poly3DCollection class or its methods. To investigate further, the relevant files should include the class definition and methods that process face colors as these are likely places to find a missing attribute or a reference arrangement that leads to the error. Scanning through the provided 'art3d.py' context, a key observation is the presence of 'Poly3DCollection', indicative that this portion of the codebase is directly involved with handling 3D collection data in plots, potentially interacting with face color settings. Moreover, the error traceback suggests the missing attribute could be involved in how face colors are retrieved or set, thus the code span analysis centers around methods dealing with color and attribute management, or the pertinent initialization functions like '__init__' to find attributes directly related to managing face colors for Poly3DCollections. In the search results, the '__init__' method of 'Poly3DCollection' is analyzed to determine if the '_facecolors2d' attribute is set or intended to be set during the initialization of 'Poly3DCollection' objects, but it was not explicitly declared or initialized, suggesting an oversight or a missing implementation that might cause the reported AttributeError.",

The initial analysis of the issue involves checking the Poly3DCollection class definition and its methods, including the __init__ method, to see if the _facecolors2d attribute is being correctly initialized or referenced. In the provided file context and search results, the Poly3DCollection class is defined with a __init__ method that does not mention _facecolors2d, which might explain why the attribute is not found. Additionally, there's a function poly_collection_2d_to_3d that potentially modifies or sets properties of Poly3DCollection objects, but it does not directly address the _facecolors2d attribute either.
