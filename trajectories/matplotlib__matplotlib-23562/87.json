By examining the provided search results from 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py', it is clear that the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, including '__init__', are central to resolving this issue. The 'get_facecolors' method within this class should likely be the focus for debugging or adjustment, as it directly concerns the error referenced in the issue. Moreover, the file 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' shows the 'Axes3D' class and its 'plot_surface' method, which instantiates and utilizes 'Poly3DCollection', this method also should be reviewed to ensure proper color handling and to detect any abnormalities.

This attribute is present in the 'get_facecolors' method within the 'Poly3DCollection' class in 'art3d.py', as confirmed by the file context. However, its absence or the erroneous reference might suggest several courses of action: 1) Check the 'PolyCollection' parent class in 'collections.py' to see how facecolors are typically managed, assuring they align with 3D collection needs. 2) Verify the initialization and property settings during the creation of Poly3DCollection in 'axes3d.py' through methods like 'plot_surface'. 3) Create or adjust the method within 'Poly3DCollection' to correctly manage '_facecolors2d'. These steps aim to trace back how face and edge colors are handled in 2D collections to properly adapt them for 3D graphics.",
