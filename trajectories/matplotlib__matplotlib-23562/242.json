This points to a potential bug in the library's handling of face colors in 3D plots. The search results contain relevant code spans from the 'art3d.py' and 'axes3d.py' files. Specifically, the 'Poly3DCollection' class in 'art3d.py' is a key player in this context as it directly relates to the error in question. The class is responsible for handling 3D polygons and is likely where the '_facecolors2d' attribute should be managed. Additionally, the 'plot_surface' method in 'axes3d.py', which uses 'Poly3DCollection', could also be relevant as it is a common method used in plotting surfaces. The analysis of these code spans reveals that the '_facecolors2d' attribute is indeed missing from the 'Poly3DCollection' class, which aligns with the error reported.
