The new search results expand on this context by providing additional methods within the `Poly3DCollection` class, particularly the `do_3d_projection` method which interacts with `_facecolors2d`. This method appears crucial as it sorts and transforms the 3D face colors into the 2D representation and assigns them to `_facecolors2d`.
