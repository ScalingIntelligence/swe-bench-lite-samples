This suggests that there may be a problem in how the face colors are being managed or inherited within the Poly3DCollection class. From the search results, we can see the definition and initialization of the Poly3DCollection class, which inherits from PolyCollection. There is also a method 'set_facecolor' that adjusts the face colors, but it does not directly address the missing '_facecolors2d' attribute. This might indicate that the implementation of face color management in the Poly3DCollection class is either incomplete or differs from the expected behavior that supports the '_facecolors2d' attribute. Given the context and the provided code, the relevant code spans to investigate further are the initialization of the Poly3DCollection class and the set_facecolor method, as they are directly related to the attributes and methods involved in this error. Additionally, a deeper inspection of the PolyCollection class from which Poly3DCollection inherits might be necessary to understand the full scope of the issue.",

This attribute is referenced in the method 'get_facecolors' of the 'Poly3DCollection' class. To resolve this issue, we need to identify where '_facecolors2d' should be defined or assigned within the 'Poly3DCollection' class. Analysing the provided code, we see that '_facecolors2d' is mentioned in the 'do_3d_projection' method, which sorts the colors based on depth and assigns them to '_facecolors2d'. This suggests that the issue might be due to '_facecolors2d' not being properly initialized or assigned before the 'get_facecolors' method is called. Therefore, the relevant code spans include the 'do_3d_projection' method and the 'get_facecolors' method to understand how '_facecolors2d' is managed within the class. Additionally, the 'set_facecolor' method is relevant as it sets '_facecolor3d', which might influence how colors are handled in a 3D context. Looking at the search results, these methods are indeed present and cover the necessary parts of the code to identify the issue and potential solutions.",

This is identified in the traceback as occurring in the 'get_facecolors' method of the 'Poly3DCollection' class. The initial context and search results include various methods within the 'Poly3DCollection' class that handle attributes related to face and edge colors. Notably, the 'do_3d_projection' method and the 'set_3d_properties' method both interact with these color attributes, but the '_facecolors2d' attribute is not set anywhere in the provided code spans. The provided search results continue to show methods for setting and getting face and edge colors in 3D and 2D, but none that address initializing or setting '_facecolors2d'. This suggests that the issue stems from '_facecolors2d' not being properly initialized or assigned to the 'Poly3DCollection' object before being accessed. Thus, further investigation into how '_facecolors2d' should be set would be necessary to resolve this issue.",

It appears that during the 3D projection, the method `update_scalarmappable` is called, which is crucial for updating color mappings. Notably, `_facecolor3d` and `_edgecolor3d` are set based on whether face and edge colors are mapped. There's also a sorting mechanism in `do_3d_projection` that affects how `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` are set. It's crucial to ensure that these attributes are correctly managed across different methods. Additionally, the `set_facecolor` method updates `_facecolor3d` using `PolyCollection.get_facecolor(self)`, which might be a critical point to inspect further for potential discrepancies.",
