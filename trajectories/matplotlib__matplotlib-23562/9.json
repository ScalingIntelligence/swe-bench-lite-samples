This issue can be traced to the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class in the provided search results. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the 'get_facecolors' method, which internally refers to '_facecolors2d'. Therefore, the relevant part of the code that needs to be examined is the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods. The '__init__' method of 'Poly3DCollection' is also identified as relevant since it initializes the class and could potentially be related to the attribute's absence. Furthermore, the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function is connected because it directly involves converting collections to 3D collections, a process that might influence the attributes set on the 'Poly3DCollection' object. This function could provide clues about how '_facecolors2d' might not be properly set or inherited in 'Poly3DCollection'. Hence, both the class definition and the conversion function are primed for inspection.",

Hence, the most relevant code spans are those from 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py' that deal with 'Poly3DCollection', particularly the '__init__' method, which is important for understanding the class's initial setup and potentially, the lack of certain attribute definitions. Additionally, the 'collections.py' file containing the 'PolyCollection' parent class is slightly relevant as it may shed light on inherited methods used in the 'Poly3DCollection', specifically the 'set_verts' and 'set_verts_and_codes' methods could influence how colors or attributes like '_facecolors2d' are handled.

The minimal example provided uses the 'plot_surface' method from 'Axes3D', which presumably creates a 'Poly3DCollection' object. This object should have the '_facecolors2d' attribute for managing face colors in 3D plots.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, the code definitions for 'Poly3DCollection', 'PolyCollection', and 'Collection' classes are present. The '__init__' methods for 'Poly3DCollection' and 'PolyCollection' are also included, which help in understanding how these objects are instantiated and what attributes they might expect to have.\n\nThe search results provide a broader context by showing other class definitions in the 'collections.py' file, such as 'Collection', '_CollectionWithSizes', 'LineCollection', 'EllipseCollection', 'PatchCollection', 'TriMesh', and 'QuadMesh'. These classes help in understanding the inheritance hierarchy and shared attributes among various types of collections in Matplotlib.\n\nGiven the focus on the missing '_facecolors2d' attribute in 'Poly3DCollection', the relevant code spans in the search results could relate to any methods that handle or set face colors or similar attributes in associated classes. The 'Collection' class, from which 'Poly3DCollection' inherits, has methods for handling colors and styles which could be relevant.\n\nGiven the lack of a direct span for '_facecolors2d', the next step would be to look into the methods and attributes related to face colors in the 'Poly3DCollection', 'PolyCollection', and 'Collection' classes. The 'set_facecolor' and 'set_edgecolor' methods in the 'Collection' class, for instance, could be relevant since they deal with color attributes that 'Poly3DCollection' might need but currently lacks.\n\nTo resolve the issue, it might be necessary to investigate further into how face color attributes are managed across these classes and whether the 'Poly3DCollection' class appropriately inherits or manually sets these attributes. This might involve code changes in the '__init__' method of 'Poly3DCollection' or adjustments in its parent class methods to ensure the '_facecolors2d' attribute is either present or that there is an alternative handling for face colors in 3D collections.",
