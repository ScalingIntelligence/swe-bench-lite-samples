Given the minimal example provided, the focus is on the interaction and methods within the 'Poly3DCollection' class, particularly where face colors might be managed or accessed.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant sections include the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class, which initializes its properties, and the method 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d', which seems relevant for converting 2D collections to 3D. It's plausible that the face color management should be situated somewhere in these sections.\n\nSince the specific error relates to missing '_facecolors2d' attribute within the 'Poly3DCollection' class, attention should direct towards where this attribute might typically be set or accessed, which isn't clearly evident in the provided spans. However, understanding the purpose of 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' method, it's reasonable to assume a potential relationship with the reported error. Thus, bases on the identified spans ('Poly3DCollection' and 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d'), these are marked as relevant as they closely relate to the class and method expected to be involved in the reported issue.",

We need to dig deeper into the methods of 'Poly3DCollection' to see if there's any section of code defining or initializing '_facecolors2d'. Additionally, we should look at the 'PolyCollection' class as 'Poly3DCollection' inherits from it. From the provided context and search results, we can identify several spans related to the 'Poly3DCollection'. These include the class definition itself, its 'set_3d_properties' method, and the 'do_3d_projection' method. In 'do_3d_projection', there's a segment of code that assigns values to '_facecolors2d' and '_edgecolors2d', which might be related to the issue. Furthermore, since the error is happening on a call to 'get_facecolors', the method itself is worth noting, although it doesn't exist in the provided code. These sections of code will be invaluable in determining the cause and potential fix for the missing attribute.",
