This error occurs when attempting to retrieve face colors using the `get_facecolors()` method. The analysis of the provided file context and search results indicates that the Poly3DCollection class indeed lacks the attribute '_facecolors2d'. Furthermore, the method `get_facecolors()` is defined to return 'self._facecolors2d', which does not exist in the class. The search results show various methods and properties within the Poly3DCollection class, including `set_zsort`, `get_vector`, `set_verts`, `set_verts_and_codes`, `set_3d_properties`, `set_sort_zpos`, `do_3d_projection`, `set_facecolor`, `set_edgecolor`, `set_alpha`, `get_facecolor`, and `get_edgecolor`. The method `do_3d_projection` is particularly relevant as it involves sorting and handling color properties, including '_facecolors2d' and '_edgecolors2d'. The method `get_facecolor` is also notable as it directly relates to the attribute '_facecolors2d' where the error originates.
