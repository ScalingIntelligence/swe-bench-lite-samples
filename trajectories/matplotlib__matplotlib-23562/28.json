The reported issue occurs when calling `get_facecolors()` on an instance of `Poly3DCollection`, specifically with the `plot_surface` method in `axes3d.py`. This indicates that the attribute `_facecolors2d` might be missing or not properly initialized in the `Poly3DCollection` class. The search should focus on the `Poly3DCollection` class and its methods in the `art3d.py` file, as well as any related methods in the `axes3d.py` file, particularly `plot_surface`.",
