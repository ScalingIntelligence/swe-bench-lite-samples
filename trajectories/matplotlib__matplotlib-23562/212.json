The 'do_3d_projection' method seems particularly relevant as it handles the projection of 3D data to 2D, where '_facecolors2d' is assigned. Additionally, the 'Axes3D.plot_surface' method in 'axes3d.py' creates a 'Poly3DCollection' object, further linking this method to the issue at hand since it involves surface plotting which is where the error would occur based on the provided minimal example.\n\nBy examining these code spans, it is possible to understand the flow and properties related to 'Poly3DCollection', which directly aids in diagnosing why '_facecolors2d' might not be present in the 'Poly3DCollection' instance, leading to the reported error.
