Given this, the most relevant code to investigate is within the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, particularly those related to face color handling. The provided search results include the 'Poly3DCollection' class with its '__init__' method and a function 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' that transforms a 2D collection into a 3D one. These are highly relevant as they directly deal with the transformation and properties of 3D collections, which could be the source of the missing attribute.

The search results provide insight into the `Collection` class, particularly the `__init__` method, which sets up many of the properties, including face and edge colors. This is particularly useful because if the `_facecolors2d` attribute doesn't exist, it's possible it might not be initialized correctly. Additionally, the `update_scalarmappable` method updates the color mappings for the face and edges, which might also be related to the missing attribute, as it directly involves handling color data.
