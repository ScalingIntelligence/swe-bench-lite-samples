To address this, it's important to check the implementation of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its parent class 'PolyCollection'. The search results provided contain the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its initialization method '__init__'. Additionally, there is a function 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' which converts a 2D collection to a 3D collection, potentially relevant to the issue at hand. Given the context of the error and the related code snippets provided, these spans are likely relevant to the reported issue. In the '__init__' method, the attribute '_facecolors2d' should be initialized if it is indeed required. Additionally, the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function should be examined to ensure it correctly sets up the 3D properties. It appears that relevant code may have been identified that can be further investigated to resolve the issue.",

Examining the existing code, it is evident that the 'Poly3DCollection' class inherits from 'PolyCollection' but does not explicitly define or override '_facecolors2d', which explains why the attribute error occurs. The provided 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods are relevant to solving this issue, particularly the '__init__' method, which initializes the class.

The provided search results include the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and an init method that sets up the class instance. Additionally, there's a function 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' that converts a 2D collection to a 3D collection, which is also potentially relevant as the issue may arise from the conversion or initialization process. Given the specific error in the traceback pointing to 'art3d.py', the most relevant code spans appear to be those defining the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods.
