The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the 'get_facecolor' method of 'Poly3DCollection'. The search results provide a detailed look into the 'Poly3DCollection' class, including its '__init__', 'set_zsort', 'get_vector', and other methods. Notably, the 'get_facecolor' method is defined to return 'self._facecolors2d', which is likely the cause of the error. Further, the 'do_3d_projection' method is responsible for setting 'self._facecolors2d' based on the depth sorting, suggesting that this attribute might not be set or maintained correctly in some scenarios. The 'plot_surface' method in 'Axes3D' class is also identified as it directly interacts with 'Poly3DCollection' objects when rendering surfaces. These findings indicate that the issue likely resides in the 'Poly3DCollection' class, specifically in how '_facecolors2d' is managed or possibly in how 'plot_surface' interacts with it. This understanding suggests that the relevant code spans should include those parts of 'Poly3DCollection' dealing with facecolors and depth sorting, as well as the 'plot_surface' method in 'Axes3D'.",

However, the '_facecolors2d' attribute itself is not directly set within the class. Additionally, the 'plot_surface' method in 'axes3d.py' constructs a 'Poly3DCollection' object, which could be where the '_facecolors2d' attribute might be assigned, but this part of the code is not included in the provided context.
