The search results from 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py' include the entirety of the 'Poly3DCollection' class definition, which is essential for understanding the root cause and potential fixes. The class contains methods for initializing the class, setting z-sorting, fetching and setting various attributes like face color and edge color, and conducting 3D projections. Notably, the class indeed lacks the attribute '_facecolors2d' in its current form. This suggests a potential bug or oversight in the class implementation. The search results are comprehensive and directly address the needs to understand and potentially rectify the issue. Specifically, the method 'do_3d_projection' is crucial as it seems to manage colors and projections, which could be relevant to the facecolor attribute's behavior.

However, the attribute '_facecolors2d' is not directly defined within this class. It is mentioned in the 'get_facecolors' method, which is expected to return this attribute.
