A thorough examination of the codebase reveals that the 'Poly3DCollection' class is indeed involved and that its 'get_facecolors' method attempts to access '_facecolors2d', which is not defined in the class. The critical parts of the codebase that need inspection are those related to the 'Poly3DCollection' class, specifically the methods 'do_3d_projection', 'set_3d_properties', and the initialization '__init__' where attributes such as '_facecolor3d' and '_edgecolor3d' are set. The search results confirm the presence of these methods and provide valuable context about how colors are handled and projected in 3D space.
