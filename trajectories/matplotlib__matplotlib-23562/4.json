The search results include the class definition of 'Poly3DCollection' along with several methods that handle face and edge colors. Notably, the 'Poly3DCollection.get_facecolor' method attempts to return '_facecolors2d', which is the attribute causing the problem. Additionally, the 'Axes3D.plot_surface' method constructs and returns an instance of 'Poly3DCollection', suggesting that this method could be where the issue arises or where a fix could be implemented. The code spans related to 'Poly3DCollection' initialization, setting and getting facecolors, and the 3D projection handling are particularly relevant. Further, the context of how 'Poly3DCollection' instances are created within 'Axes3D' will be crucial for understanding the complete scope of the issue.",

This method attempts to return 'self._facecolors2d', suggesting that the attribute might not be initialized properly.
