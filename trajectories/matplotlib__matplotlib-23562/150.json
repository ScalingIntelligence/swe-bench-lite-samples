The error message indicates that the '_facecolors2d' attribute is missing from an instance of 'Poly3DCollection'. This suggests that the problem might be within the 'Poly3DCollection' class itself or its drawing/rendering logic. To pinpoint the exact location of the problem, I will search for the 'Poly3DCollection' class and the 'get_facecolors' method in the provided context. Additionally, I will look for any other methods or parts of the code that interact with or modify '_facecolors2d'.",

Two relevant code spans are found in the search results: the definition of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function. The 'Poly3DCollection' class is directly linked to the reported issue, and the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function involves conversion of 2D collections to 3D, which might affect the face color attributes. Understanding how these two elements interact, especially in the context of generating 3D plots and managing face colors, is crucial.

This suggests that the _facecolors2d attribute might be missing or not properly initialized in the Poly3DCollection class. The current file context already includes some relevant code spans related to Poly3DCollection. The new search results provide more context about the class, including methods like 'set_3d_properties', 'do_3d_projection', 'set_facecolor', 'set_edgecolor', and 'set_alpha', which are directly related to handling colors and projection of 3D objects. Specifically, the method 'do_3d_projection' involves sorting and projecting the 3D segments to 2D, which might be the place where _facecolors2d is supposed to be set or accessed. However, this method does not explicitly set _facecolors2d, which could be the cause of the reported issue. The 'get_facecolor' method returns _facecolors2d, which indicates this attribute is meant to be used. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue would be those directly involving color management and projection in the Poly3DCollection class.",
