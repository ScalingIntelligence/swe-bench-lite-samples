The provided minimal example demonstrates this error, occurring specifically in the `get_facecolors` method of the Poly3DCollection class. The analysis of the search results shows that the implementation of `get_facecolors` in the Poly3DCollection class directly references '_facecolors2d'. Given this direct linkage, it's clear that the issue arises from either a missing or improperly initialized '_facecolors2d' attribute within the Poly3DCollection class. Notably, the implementation of the class and its methods provided in the search results do not visibly handle or initialize '_facecolors2d' before its first use in `get_facecolors`. This oversight likely leads to the AttributeError when attempting to access '_facecolors2d'. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified.
