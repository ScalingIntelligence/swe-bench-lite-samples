This attribute is likely crucial for handling face colors in 3D plots. Given the traceback and the minimal example provided, it is essential to find the implementation of the `Poly3DCollection` class to understand how face colors are managed and why this attribute might be missing. Additionally, the `plot_surface` method in `Axes3D` is used in the minimal example, so it may also be relevant to investigate how it interacts with `Poly3DCollection`.",

The relevant code spans include the entire `Poly3DCollection` class definition, particularly focusing on the methods related to face colors and 3D properties. Additionally, the `poly_collection_2d_to_3d` function is also relevant as it modifies collections to be 3D aware and sets 3D properties. The search results for 'Poly3DCollection' in `art3d.py` provide comprehensive context for the issue, including initialization, setting and getting face colors, and handling 3D properties.

            "scratch_pad": "The provided file context contains the implementation of the `Poly3DCollection` class from `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d`. The class methods `set_facecolor`, `set_edgecolor`, and `set_alpha` update the 3D face colors, edge colors, and alpha respectively, storing them in `_facecolor3d`, `_edgecolor3d`, and updating the alpha property. The `do_3d_projection` method is responsible for sorting the 2D versions of face and edge colors (`_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d`) by depth. However, the script does not directly initialize `_facecolors2d`, and relies on the sorting process in `do_3d_projection` to set these attributes. As a result, if `do_3d_projection` is not called or does not execute as expected, `_facecolors2d` would not be set, leading to the reported issue. Given the provided code context, it appears that the relevant code that would need to be modified or checked is indeed present in the file context, focusing on ensuring `do_3d_projection` correctly initializes `_facecolors2d`. It's likely that this method is intended to be called before `get_facecolors` (which relies on `_facecolors2d`), ensuring the attribute is correctly set prior to accessing it. Therefore, the file context is relevant and seems complete for addressing the issue.",
