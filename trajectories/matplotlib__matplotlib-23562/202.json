The search results provide a detailed look into the `Poly3DCollection` class and its methods. Notably, the `do_3d_projection` method is where `_facecolors2d` is set based on the depth sorting of polygons. This suggests that the issue might be caused by a failure in the depth sorting process or an initialization issue where `_facecolors2d` is expected to be initialized but isn't. Given this context, the relevant code spans include the entire `do_3d_projection` method and the constructor (`__init__`), where initial properties are set. Additionally, the `set_3d_properties` method, which also touches upon face colors, should be considered. These spans provide a comprehensive view of where and how `_facecolors2d` is managed, which is crucial for diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported issue.",
