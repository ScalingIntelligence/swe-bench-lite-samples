This issue is likely located in the methods responsible for handling colors and attributes of 3D collections in the library. The search results show relevant code spans in two files: 'art3d.py' and 'axes3d.py'. In 'art3d.py', the 'Poly3DCollection' class is defined and includes methods for initialization and color handling. Specifically, the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function involves converting 2D collections to 3D, which might be related to the _facecolors2d attribute error. In 'axes3d.py', the 'Axes3D' class includes the 'plot_surface' method, used in the provided minimal example. This method constructs a 'Poly3DCollection' and sets face colors based on different parameters. Analyzing the code, it appears that the '_facecolors2d' attribute is not defined within the 'Poly3DCollection' class, suggesting that this might be the root cause of the error. The identified code spans are relevant to understanding how 3D collections manage colors and may offer insights into why the '_facecolors2d' attribute is missing.",

The minimal example provided showcases the issue when attempting to call 'get_facecolors' on a 'Poly3DCollection' object created via 'ax.plot_surface'. This suggests that the problem lies either in the initialization of 'Poly3DCollection' or in the method definitions related to handling face colors. Given the context in 'art3d.py', we see that 'Poly3DCollection' inherits from 'PolyCollection'. However, a close inspection in 'collections.py' reveals that 'PolyCollection' and its parent '_CollectionWithSizes' do not manage attributes like '_facecolors2d'. Therefore, the implementation of '_facecolors2d' should be in 'art3d.py'. Current spans in 'art3d.py' do not explicitly show where '_facecolors2d' is defined or manipulated, raising a need to inspect further for where this attribute should be managed. Given the current data, it's inconclusive where exactly '_facecolors2d' is meant to be defined or accessed, warranting further investigation in 'art3d.py'.

This suggests that the issue might be related to how `Poly3DCollection` is being instantiated within `plot_surface` in `Axes3D`.
