The minimal example provided fails on the line `r.get_facecolors()` and the traceback points to the method `get_facecolor` in the `Poly3DCollection` class. This method tries to return `self._facecolors2d`, which is the attribute that apparently does not exist. Given the file context and the new search results, it's clear that the `Poly3DCollection` class does not initialize or maintain the `_facecolors2d` attribute. The `do_3d_projection` method attempts to set `self._facecolors2d` but only under certain conditions. This likely means that the condition isn't met in every case, leading to the AttributeError. The relevant sections in the code to address this issue would be the `__init__` and `do_3d_projection` methods of the `Poly3DCollection` class to ensure `_facecolors2d` is always set appropriately under all conditions. Additionally, the `get_facecolor` method should be checked to see if it can provide a fallback or default value if `_facecolors2d` is not available.",
