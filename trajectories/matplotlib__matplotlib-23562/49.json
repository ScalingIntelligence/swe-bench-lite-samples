This indicates that the attribute _facecolors2d is expected but not found in the instance of Poly3DCollection. The traceback suggests that this problem occurs in the context of plotting 3D surfaces using Matplotlib, specifically when calling get_facecolors on a Poly3DCollection object. The search results provide a detailed look at the Poly3DCollection class and its methods. Notably, the class Poly3DCollection inherits from PolyCollection and extends it for 3D plotting. The method do_3d_projection is particularly relevant because it manually sets _facecolors2d during its operation. This can help in understanding how face colors are being handled and potentially where the _facecolors2d attribute might be missing or not initialized properly. Also, regarding the set_3d_properties method, it sets self._facecolor3d and self._edgecolor3d but does not explicitly mention _facecolors2d. This discrepancy might be the cause of the issue. Based on this analysis, identifying the relevant code spans involved in the initialization and use of _facecolors2d within the Poly3DCollection class is crucial. This includes the methods do_3d_projection, set_facecolor, and set_edgecolor. The search results seem comprehensive enough to cover the suspected areas, making it feasible to pinpoint the exact locations contributing to the reported issue.",
