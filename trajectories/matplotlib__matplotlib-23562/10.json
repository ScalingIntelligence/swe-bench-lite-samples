This suggests that the class is missing the attribute '_facecolors2d', which is used in the method 'get_facecolors'. The traceback points to the specific line in 'art3d.py' where the exception occurs. Given the context, it's clear that the relevant code spans should focus on the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its methods, particularly those related to face colors, like '__init__', 'set_3d_properties', 'do_3d_projection', and 'get_facecolors'. The search results confirm these expectations by providing detailed definitions and usages of the 'Poly3DCollection' class and its related methods, which is essential for debugging and potentially implementing a fix. The presence of 'set_facecolor', 'set_edgecolor', and 'set_alpha' methods in 'Poly3DCollection' further supports the need to review and potentially adjust how face colors are handled in this class to address the missing '_facecolors2d' attribute. Additionally, the 'poly_collection_2d_to_3d' function, which converts 2D collections to 3D, might also be relevant, as it involves the initialization and properties setting for 3D collections, potentially indicating where the '_facecolors2d' attribute might be missing during this conversion process.
