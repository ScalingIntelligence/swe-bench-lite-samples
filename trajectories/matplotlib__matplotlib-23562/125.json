To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the creation and manipulation of 'Poly3DCollection' objects and determine if this attribute or method is being correctly used or if there is an implementation oversight. The new search results include the 'Axes3D.plot_surface' method, which appears to be directly related to the creation of 'Poly3DCollection' objects as seen in the return statement of the method. This section of the code is likely where the issue originates, so it is crucial to carefully examine its implementation.
