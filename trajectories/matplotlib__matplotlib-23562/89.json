The minimal example provided from the user and the traceback message clearly show the error occurring in the 'art3d.py' file when attempting to access this attribute. Given the current context and the search results, there are two main files involved: 'art3d.py' and 'axes3d.py'. In 'art3d.py', 'Poly3DCollection' is defined along with its '__init__' method, but there's no explicit definition or handling of '_facecolors2d'. Conversely, the 'plot_surface' method in 'axes3d.py' utilizes 'Poly3DCollection' for rendering surfaces and manages face colors potentially through other attributes that seem to mimic the intended functionality of '_facecolors2d'. These file interactions, coupled with the method used for shading, appear critical since they all directly relate to how colors are assigned and managed for 3D objects. There seems to be a crucial link between shading and color assignment that might hint at a possible relocation or renaming of what '_facecolors2d' used to represent. It's consequential to not only pinpoint the specific code spans (like the aforementioned 'plot_surface' method) but also to interpret if the history or documentation provides any clues as to why '_facecolors2d' might have been altered or superseded by another existing attribute or method within these code blocks. For instance, 'set_facecolors' and 'set_edgecolors' are seen in implementing shading, which might be depositories for the previous role of '_facecolors2d'. Analysis further confirms that while '_facecolors2d' is not explicitly defined or present in the code spans, the logic aimed by '_facecolors2d' is retained and adapted in '_shade_colors' method and 'plot_surface' method. Thus, contrary to acknowledging the non-existence of '_facecolors2d', these found code segments corroborate an intentional or evolutionary shift where functionality was likely restructured under new method names that facilitate the shading and coloring similar to what '_facecolors2d' would do. Moreover, it seems beneficial to cross-reference these scenarios with any migration or version changes mentioned under the User's issue category. Additionally, since shade can be conditionally activated and dynamically altered based on certain attributes like 'cmap', it also highlights the pioneering approach wherein basically dynamic shading adjustments are part of this 3D plotting development strain.",
