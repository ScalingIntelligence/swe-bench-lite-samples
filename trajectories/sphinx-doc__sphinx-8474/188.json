This specifically affects the build process for 'singlehtml' and 'latex' outputs. To address this, it's crucial to identify code sections within the Sphinx codebase that handle table number assignments, particularly those influenced by configuration settings like 'numfig'. The search results include sections from sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py, sphinx/builders/singlehtml.py, and sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py. These files contain classes and methods that are pivotal for handling footnotes, table of contents, and numbering in the context of different Sphinx builders. Specifically, the methods 'assign_figure_numbers' in TocTreeCollector, 'assemble_toc_secnumbers', and 'assemble_toc_fignumbers' in SingleFileHTMLBuilder, and related footnote handling in LaTeXFootnoteTransform and LaTeXFootnoteVisitor seem relevant to identifying and possibly fixing the issue with table number assignments. These sections should be examined in more detail to understand how they manage and assign numbers to tables and other elements that might lead to the observed warning.",

Key elements from the issue include the warning itself, the Sphinx version (3.3), and the build formats (`singlehtml` and `latex`). The issue also mentions the `numref` logic, suggesting that changes in how numbers are assigned to tables might be the cause.\n\nIn the current file context, we have several files and spans that are related to the LaTeX and singlehtml builders, as well as transforms and environment collectors that handle table and figure numbering. Notably, the `TocTreeCollector` class in `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py` is responsible for assigning figure numbers, which could be related to the issue.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context in files like `sphinx/config.py` and `sphinx/domains/std.py`. The `Config` class in `sphinx/config.py` contains configurations for `numfig` and `numfig_format`, which are directly related to number references in the documentation. The `StandardDomain` class in `sphinx/domains/std.py` handles the resolution of number references, which is critical for understanding where the warnings might be originating.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the context provided, the relevant code spans should focus on configurations and logic related to number assignments for tables, especially in the `numfig` and `numref` contexts. The identified spans in `sphinx/config.py` and `sphinx/domains/std.py` are relevant as they involve the configuration and handling of number references.",

The functions 'assign_figure_numbers' and 'assemble_toc_fignumbers' in the 'toctree.py' and 'singlehtml.py' files respectively, seem to directly relate to the warning about no number being assigned for tables. Additionally, the 'numfig' configuration in 'config.py' affects how figure numbers are handled, which is crucial for tables as well. Although the exact line causing the warning is not pinpointed, these areas appear relevant. Further, the 'enumerable_nodes' attribute in 'std.py' is where nodes like 'table' are enumerated, influencing numbering.
