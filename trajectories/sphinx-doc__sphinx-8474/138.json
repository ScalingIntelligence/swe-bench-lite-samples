The search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the LaTeX writer and the TocTreeCollector. These spans deal with the LaTeX translator, section numbering, figure numbering, and the handling of tables in LaTeX and HTML builders. The specific sections to focus on are related to the LaTeXTranslator methods for handling tables and the StandardDomain method for resolving numref cross-references, which directly deals with the numref logic. Additionally, the TocTreeCollector methods for assigning section and figure numbers are crucial for understanding how numbering is handled in the documentation. The spans identified thus far cover the necessary parts of the code to investigate the issue further, including the LaTeXBuilder, SingleFileHTMLBuilder, and StandardDomain classes. The identified spans are in sphinx/writers/latex.py, sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py, sphinx/builders/singlehtml.py, and sphinx/domains/std.py.",

These methods handle aspects such as table column specifications, LaTeX message catalog writing, assembling table of contents section and figure numbers, resolving cross-references for numbered references, and assigning section and figure numbers.
