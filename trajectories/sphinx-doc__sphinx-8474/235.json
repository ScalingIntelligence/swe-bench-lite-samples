Given the nature of the issue, the search seeks to identify changes or relevant code sections related to 'numref' in the Sphinx codebase. Upon analyzing the provided search results, several code spans appear relevant. The LaTeXBuilder class and its associated setup function indicate the configuration and setup for the LaTeX builder, which is directly related to the 'latex' build mentioned in the issue. The LaTeXTranslator class and its generate_numfig_format method show handling of figure and table numbering, which is crucial for resolving the warning. The TocTreeCollector class, particularly the assign_section_numbers and assign_figure_numbers methods, handle the assignment of numbers to sections and figures, respectively. The StandardDomain class's _resolve_numref_xref method is responsible for resolving references with 'numref', aligning with the issue at hand. Lastly, the AutoNumbering class's apply method notes the automatic numbering of targets, which could influence the warning if not properly handled. These sections collectively address the issue by encompassing configuration, translation, and numbering logic within Sphinx, providing a comprehensive context to understand and resolve the 'no number is assigned for table' warning.",
