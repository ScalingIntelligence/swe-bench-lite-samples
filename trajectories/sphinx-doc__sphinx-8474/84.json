The TocTreeCollector class in toctree.py is particularly relevant as it manages section numbers and figure numbers, which could include tables. The methods assign_section_numbers and assign_figure_numbers within this class suggest that it handles the assignment of numbers to various elements in the documentation, which would include tables. Additionally, the StandardDomain class in std.py handles the resolution of cross-references including numref, which could be related to the warning if it involves tables without assigned numbers. The MathDomain class in math.py also includes handling for numbered equations, similar to how tables might be numbered. Overall, while specific table-numbering logic might be distributed across these files, the relevant code for addressing the warning appears to be present among this context, hinting at the possibility of issues with configuration or conditions where numbering logic doesn't apply as expected.",
