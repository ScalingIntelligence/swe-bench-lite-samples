Analyzing the search results, it's clear that the focus should be on the changes or behaviors in the numbering mechanisms, especially those related to tables or possibly figures that might share similar logic in numbering. The `TocTreeCollector` class in `toctree.py` appears highly relevant, particularly the methods `assign_section_numbers` and `assign_figure_numbers`. These methods handle the assignment of numbers to sections and figures, respectively. Given the warning's context, it suggests that there might be a scenario where a table reference (or potentially similar elements) is not being assigned a number properly. Reviewing these methods in detail, especially around conditions that could lead to a 'None' being assigned or not properly handled, could help pinpoint the source of the warning. The `SingleFileHTMLBuilder` in `singlehtml.py` is also relevant as it is directly involved in the build process for single HTML pages, which is one of the affected formats.",
