In particular, the 'HTML5Translator.visit_table' and 'LaTeXTranslator.table' functions seem relevant, as they deal with table handling in the HTML and LaTeX output, respectively. Additionally, the 'StandardDomain._resolve_numref_xref' function in 'sphinx/domains/std.py' handles numeration references, which might be related to the issue of missing table numbers. The 'TocTreeCollector.assign_section_numbers' and 'TocTreeCollector.assign_figure_numbers' functions in 'sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py' also seem relevant, as they handle the assignment of section and figure numbers, potentially including tables.

The `LaTeXTranslator` class in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and `HTML5Translator` in `sphinx/writers/html5.py` are also significant as they handle the translation of the document structure into LaTeX and HTML respectively, and any changes in their logic could affect how table numbers are processed and output.

Given the extensive context provided, it's clear that the `StandardDomain._resolve_numref_xref` method is responsible for resolving numref cross-references and that it logs a warning when no number is assigned. This could be due to the table not being properly enumerated in the first place, as handled by the `AutoNumbering` transform. Additionally, the `TocTreeCollector.assign_figure_numbers` method might be relevant, as it assigns numbers to figures and might need to be adapted to handle tables similarly. The `HTML5Translator.visit_table` and `LaTeXTranslator.visit_table` methods, which deal with the rendering of tables in their respective formats, could also be key to understanding the number assignment process for tables. Despite the depth of this analysis, there remains a possibility that not all relevant pieces of the codebase are included in the provided context, especially if the issue stems from configurations or external dependencies not covered here.",
