To identify the relevant code spans, I focused on sections that deal with table handling, numbering, and referencing. The search results provided code spans related to table classes, LaTeX translators, and transforms that handle auto-numbering and toctree assignments.\n\nRelevant spans include LaTeXTranslator.visit_table, which handles the initial visit to a table and the assignment of table properties. StandardDomain._resolve_numref_xref, which deals with resolving cross-references for numbered items like tables, is also relevant, especially where it logs warnings if no number is assigned. AutoNumbering.apply and TocTreeCollector.assign_figure_numbers deal with automatic numbering and assignment of figure numbers, which can be related to tables if tables are considered figures in the context of numbering.\n\nThese spans provide a clear indication that the codebase has logic dedicated to handling table numbering and cross-referencing, which is directly related to the reported issue of missing table numbers. By analyzing these sections, we can pinpoint where the logic for assigning numbers might have changed or where the warning is being triggered.",
