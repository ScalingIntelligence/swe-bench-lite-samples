The LaTeXTranslator in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and HTML5Translator in `sphinx/writers/html5.py` both handle table nodes, which are central to this issue. Additionally, the TocTreeCollector in `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py` is responsible for assigning figure numbers, including tables. The 'assign_figure_numbers' method in particular manages the numerical indexing of figures and could be the source of the issue if there are changes in how tables are detected or processed within it.

Key areas to focus on include the methods handling table visits and those related to figure numbering. Specifically, the visit_table methods in LaTeXTranslator and HTML5Translator need to be examined for how they handle table elements and potentially adjust or initialize numbering settings. Additionally, the assign_figure_numbers method in TocTreeCollector is crucial as it directly addresses the assignment of numbers to figures (including tables), which aligns with the reported issue.
