Likely areas to investigate include the logic for assigning section numbers, figure numbers, and table numbers in the TocTreeCollector class, and the LaTeX and HTML translators handling table nodes. Additionally, the StandardDomain class's handling of numref references might be relevant. Given the focus on table numbering, I'll search for classes and functions directly related to these tasks.",
