It's likely that this could be related to changes in how numbering is handled, potentially in transforms or builders that are responsible for assigning numbers to tables. The context provided includes various files related to different aspects of the Sphinx build process such as translators, directives, transforms, and builders. Specifically, files under the 'sphinx/builders/latex/' directory and related to transforms might contain the relevant logic for table numbering. The 'assign_section_numbers' and 'assign_figure_numbers' methods in 'sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py' are potential places to look as they might encompass table numbering as well. Additionally, the 'generate_numfig_format' method in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' could be pertinent due to its name suggesting direct involvement with number formatting. Focusing on these areas might help pinpoint the source of the warning.",

This warning suggests a potential issue with numbering mechanisms in Sphinx, particularly related to tables or other numbered elements. While the changelog doesn't indicate any changes to 'numref', the search results have several relevant sections that deal with numbering, particularly in the context of tables and figures. The 'TocTreeCollector.assign_figure_numbers' method in 'sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py' explicitly handles numbering of figures and might be a good starting point to trace the source of the warning. Additionally, the 'LaTeXTranslator.__init__' method in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' involves configurations for numeric figure formats which could be linked to the warning, especially if the LaTeX output is where the warning is manifesting.
