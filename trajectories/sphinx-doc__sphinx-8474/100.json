I located several relevant code spans in multiple files: sphinx/writers/latex.py and sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py. Specifically, I identified the Table class and the LaTeXTranslator class, which seem to handle the table numbering and LaTeX translation aspects. Additionally, the 'TocTreeCollector' class from the toctree.py file coordinates the numbering of different elements in the documentation, including figures with numbers. I found the 'generate_numfig_format' method in the LaTeXTranslator, which handles the format of figure and table numbers, suggesting that the issue resides in this formatting logic. I've identified and extracted these various code spans since they relate directly to the table numbering or potentially affected by the updated Sphinx version.",

This issue seems to be related to the management of 'numref' functionality in Sphinx, specifically concerning the numbering of tables. Given the content of the provided code snippets from both the latex writer and the toctree collector, it is clear that these parts of Sphinx handle the transformation and management of table structures and their respective numbering. The LaTeXTranslator class in the latex writer handles the translation of table nodes into LaTeX, while the TocTreeCollector in the toctree collector is responsible for managing the numbering of various document elements, including tables. Specifically, the methods within these classes that deal with table numbering and assignment of numbers to these elements seem to be relevant. The 'generate_numfig_format' method in LaTeXTranslator and 'assign_section_numbers' and 'assign_figure_numbers' in TocTreeCollector are of particular interest as they directly involve the assignment of numbers to figures, tables, and sections. Thus, these methods and related parts of the code are targets for further examination to understand how the numbering for tables is handled and potentially identify where the issue arises due to the v3.3 upgrade.",
