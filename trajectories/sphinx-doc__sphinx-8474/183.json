This could be related to changes in how section numbers are assigned or handled within the Sphinx environment. Given the context, the most relevant part of the codebase to investigate would be the section that deals with assigning section numbers, particularly within the `TocTreeCollector` class. This class is responsible for collecting and organizing table of contents data and assigning section numbers during the build process. The method `assign_section_numbers` within this class is especially pertinent as it directly handles the assignment of section numbers and could be where the warning originates. It's worth examining how this method processes and assigns numbers to sections, especially around tables, to determine if there are any changes or new conditions that might trigger the warning. This method also uses a nested function `_walk_toc` to traverse the table of contents nodes and assign numbers, which needs to be reviewed for any changes or issues post-upgrade.",

This issue likely involves the logic for assigning section numbers, which is handled by the `TocTreeCollector` class in the `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py` file. The key method in this context is `assign_section_numbers`, which is responsible for assigning section numbers to various elements in the documentation. In the provided search results, we see the `TocTreeCollector` class and its `assign_section_numbers` method again. This method iterates through various nodes and assigns section numbers, handling cases where no number is assigned appropriately. The presence of this method in both the file context and search results suggests that it is central to the issue. Additionally, the `get_updated_docs` method, which calls `assign_section_numbers`, is also significant as it indicates that section number assignment is part of the broader process of updating documentation. Given this context, the relevant code spans appear to be correctly identified, and further investigation should focus on enhancing this part of the code to handle the warnings effectively.",
