These files contain classes and methods related to the LaTeX and single HTML builders, as well as functions responsible for assigning section and figure numbers. Specifically, the LaTeXBuilder class in sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py and the methods assign_section_numbers and assign_figure_numbers in sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py appear to be directly involved in the process of assigning numbers to elements, which could be related to the reported warnings.
