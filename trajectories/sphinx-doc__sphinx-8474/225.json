Also, considering the nature of the issue, the 'numref' related functionality in the 'std.py' and 'latex.py' files are likely to be relevant. This could involve the '_resolve_numref_xref' method in 'std.py' or the 'visit_table' or 'depart_table' methods in 'latex.py'. Furthermore, the 'TocTreeCollector' class in 'toctree.py' might also be responsible for processing tables and assigning numbers.

The search results provide key insights into this: 1. The StandardDomain class in `sphinx/domains/std.py` handles numref resolving, specifically in the `_resolve_numref_xref` method. This method includes logic to log a warning if no number is assigned for a figure, which aligns with the reported issue. 2. The LaTeXTranslator class in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` manages table rendering in LaTeX format, but this class doesn't handle the numref logic directly. 3. The TocTreeCollector class in `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py` manages section and figure number assignments, which could influence numref number assignment. This class includes methods `assign_section_numbers` and `assign_figure_numbers` that could be relevant to the numref issue. These findings indicate that the resolution likely lies within adjusting the numref resolving logic in `sphinx/domains/std.py`, potentially in conjunction with adjustments in `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py`. Additional checks on how figure and section numbers are assigned or retrieved might also be necessary.",
