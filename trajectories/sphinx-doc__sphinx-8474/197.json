Upon analyzing the search results, the most relevant sections are found in 'sphinx/domains/std.py' and 'sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py'. In 'sphinx/domains/std.py', the method '_resolve_numref_xref' is responsible for resolving cross-references for numbered figures and handles the logic for displaying warnings if a number is not assigned.

Additionally, the 'TocTreeCollector' class in 'sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py' is responsible for collecting and processing tables of contents and numbers for sections and figures, making it a relevant part of the numref logic.

The search results provided include code spans from various Sphinx modules, notably 'sphinx/writers/latex.py', 'sphinx/writers/html5.py', and 'sphinx/domains/std.py'. These files include relevant classes and methods such as 'LaTeXTranslator.visit_table', 'LaTeXTranslator.generate_numfig_format', 'HTML5Translator.generate_targets_for_table', and 'StandardDomain._resolve_numref_xref'. Each of these spans addresses different aspects of the Sphinx build process, especially concerning table handling and numref functionality. The 'StandardDomain._resolve_numref_xref' method, in particular, is crucial as it directly resolves cross-references, checking for assigned numbers for tables and other elements, and generating warnings if no number is assigned. This method is highly relevant to the reported issue. Overall, the identified code spans are pertinent to understanding and resolving the issue, providing a comprehensive view of the numref logic in Sphinx.",

Additionally, the `TocTreeCollector` class includes methods `assign_section_numbers` and `assign_figure_numbers`, responsible for assigning numbers to sections and figures, respectively.
