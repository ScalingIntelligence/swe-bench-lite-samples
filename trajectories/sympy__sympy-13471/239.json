The error trace points to the 'numbers.py' file and the 'Float' class within sympy. Investigating this file further and looking for instances where float handling may differ between Python versions is crucial. Additionally, the 'evalf.py' file could be relevant as it deals with evaluation of expressions, potentially where float precision issues arise during cross-version compatibility.",

The error occurs during the unpickling process in Python 3, specifically in the 'sympy.core.numbers.Float' class. The traceback indicates that the error originates from the '__new__' method of the 'Number' class in 'sympy/core/numbers.py', where it tries to convert a float component that is represented differently in Python 3 compared to Python 2. This points to the need to handle the pickle serialization and deserialization of 'Float' objects in a Python 2-3 compatible way. The 'Float' class contains methods relevant to pickling, such as '__getnewargs__' and '__getstate__', which could be modified to ensure compatibility between Python versions. Additionally, the '_eval_evalf' method in the 'Float' class is responsible for numeric evaluation, which is a critical part of the pickling process if the object needs to be reconstructed numerically. Other files, such as 'sympy/core/evalf.py' and 'sympy/core/function.py', contain '_eval_evalf' methods that might also be involved in the pickling and numerical evaluation process. Therefore, these spans of code are relevant to the issue as they directly deal with the representation and handling of 'Float' objects.",
