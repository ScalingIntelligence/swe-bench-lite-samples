            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a problem with pickling a sympy expression containing a float in Python 2 and then trying to load it in Python 3. The error trace suggests that the issue is in the handling of the float conversion in the `Float` class's `__new__` method when loaded in Python 3. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to convert a string representation of a float from a hexadecimal format (likely from a pickle) back into an integer.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file contains several relevant code spans. The `Float.__new__` method's handling of different input types, including strings and floats, and its conversion to mpf representation are highly relevant. Also, the `mpf_norm` function, which normalizes the mpf representation, could be related to ensuring compatibility across different Python versions. Therefore, these spans are relevant to the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the `Float._new` class method, which creates a new Float instance after normalizing the mpf representation, is also relevant as it could be involved in the process of loading a pickled expression. The `Float` class's arithmetic methods (__add__, __sub__, __mod__, __rmod__) are less directly relevant but provide context on how Float instances interact with other numerical types.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the context provided in the search results, the identified relevant spans include the entire `Float.__new__` method, the `mpf_norm` function, and the `Float._new` class method. These spans address the core of the issue related to float handling and conversion in the sympy library.",

Specifically, the conversion and normalization of float representations, including handling special cases like 'inf' and 'nan', might not be consistent across versions. Additionally, the method `_new` involves normalizing mpf tuples which could be a source of discrepancies, especially with the representation of floats containing `1L`. It's crucial to ensure that all float representations are handled uniformly to maintain compatibility. Further investigation should focus on these areas particularly to see if adjustments or additional version-specific handling is necessary.",

The error message suggests a problem with the conversion of a float during unpickling in Python 3. Analyzing the search results, I see multiple relevant sections, notably the Float class, its __new__ method, and methods handling mathematical operations and conversions. The Float.__new__ method handles the creation of Float instances, which could be relevant for pickling and unpickling operations. Additionally, the Float._new method and the mpf_norm function are used for normalizing mpf representations, which might be involved in the error scenario. The Float.__getnewargs__ and __getstate__ methods are directly related to the pickling process, and their implementations could influence how Float objects are serialized and deserialized. These sections are crucial for understanding and resolving the pickle compatibility issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
