There is also a distinction made between Python 2's 'xrange' and Python 3's 'range', which could indirectly impact how floats are handled or serialized. However, the context does not directly address the exact line of code that fails when loading floats in Python 3 that were originally created in Python 2. The 'sympify.py' file deals with the conversion of different types and forms of input into SymPy expressions, which could also be relevant for the serialization process as it involves casting and transformation of expressions, potentially including floats. Given the complexity of the issue and the breadth of files and strategies SymPy might use for its operations, while the provided context is relevant, it may not cover all specific instances where floats could be failing during the pickling process across Python versions.

This involves understanding how Python 2 handles floats and how it affects their conversion when loaded in Python 3. The provided context and search results focus on Python version compatibility and conversion handling, which are directly relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `compatibility.py` file has code spans defining how integers, floats, and other types are handled across Python versions, such as the `integer_types` definition and the `PY3` flag. The `sympify.py` file also contains code related to type conversion and handling of different types, though not directly related to the float issue raised. Given these search results, I have identified relevant spans in `compatibility.py` including `integer_types`, `PY3`, and `long` type handling, which are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving cross-version numerical type handling issues.",

The inspection revealed that compatibility.py handles Python 2 to Python 3 compatibility, including type definitions such as floats and integers. However, direct handling of floats during the pickling process was not explicitly found in the provided context. Additionally, the sympify.py file handles type conversion for sympify, but the direct pickling of float-containing expressions was not explicitly addressed in the provided context.
