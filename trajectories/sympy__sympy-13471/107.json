The error traceback points to the __new__ method in the Float class within sympy/core/numbers.py, specifically the line where a hexadecimal value is being processed by `long`. This indicates a potential issue with how floats are handled in the pickle process, especially when crossing the Python version boundary. The search results provided include multiple spans of code from the Float class, which are relevant to the handling of float values and their serialization, thus aligning with the reported issue. Notably, the Float.__new__ span is of particular interest as it deals with the instantiation of Float objects, which is where the error is occurring. Additionally, the Float._new span, although not directly linked to the error, is relevant for handling the instantiation of Float objects under specific conditions. Other spans like Float.__add__, Float.__div__, Float.__mod__, and others are also relevant as they deal with arithmetic operations on Float objects, which could be affected by the pickle/unpickle process. The presence of these spans suggests that the search results are relevant to the reported issue, covering both the initialization and the arithmetic operations of Float objects, which are crucial for understanding and resolving the pickle/unpickle compatibility issue.",
