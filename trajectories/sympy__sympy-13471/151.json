The error traceback points to a specific line in `sympy/core/numbers.py` where a `ValueError` is triggered due to an invalid literal for `int()` with base 16. The search results include multiple spans from `sympy/core/numbers.py`, specifically focusing on the `Float` class and its methods. These methods are crucial for handling float operations, which could be related to the pickle issue since the error occurs during the handling of floats. Additionally, `sympy/core/compatibility.py` contains code related to Python version compatibility, which is also relevant as the issue involves cross-version incompatibilities. The `as_int` function in `compatibility.py` could be involved in the conversion that fails during the pickle operation. From the analysis, the spans related to the `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and the `as_int` function in `compatibility.py` are identified as highly relevant to the reported issue.",

The error occurs when trying to convert the hexadecimal value '1L' to an integer with base 16. The provided search results include the relevant sections of the `Float` class, specifically the `__new__` method and other related methods that handle the creation and internal representation of `Float` instances, including the conversion of various types of input to the internal mpf representation. Additionally, the `mpf_norm` function is included, which is used for normalizing the mpf representation of float numbers. These sections of code are directly relevant to the issue, as they involve the creation, internal representation, and conversion of `Float` instances, all of which are central to the reported issue.
