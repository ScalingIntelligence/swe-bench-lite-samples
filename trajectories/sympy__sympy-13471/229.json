Understanding the behavior of `mpf` values and how they are handled during these operations is crucial. The spans of code identified include the import statements, the `Float` class definition, the `__new__` method and the `_new` method within the `Float` class.

Specifically, the error message 'ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'' points to problematic code in the 'numbers.py' file. Upon examining the provided file context, I found multiple relevant sections in the 'Float' class that deal with float handling, including sections on initializing floats from different types, arithmetic operations involving floats, and power evaluations with floats. These sections are crucial for understanding and addressing the pickling compatibility issue.
