The error message suggests that the problem is occurring in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, specifically in the `Float.__new__` method where a hexadecimal value is being processed, leading to a `ValueError`. This indicates that the code responsible for handling the conversion and processing of float values in sympy, particularly in the `Float` class, is likely where the fix needs to be applied. Therefore, the relevant code spans would be those that deal with the initialization and handling of float values within this class, including the `__new__` constructor and any methods directly related to float processing. Identifying these spans will help in understanding how pickle operations might be failing across Python versions due to differences in how floats are serialized and deserialized between the versions.",
