The search results for sympy/core/numbers.py are relevant as they detail the Float class implementation and its methods for handling floats, including conversion from various types like strings, floats, decimals, and mpf tuples. Key spans identified include the constructor __new__, method _new for new float instances, and utility function mpf_norm for normalizing mpf tuples. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to float handling. It is also important to consider other methods like _eval_power which may indirectly address the issue by handling float powers and expressions.",
