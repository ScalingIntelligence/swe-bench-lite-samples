The error traceback points to the `numbers.py` file in the sympy/core directory, specifically referencing a `ValueError` in the `Float` class method `__new__`. This suggests that the problem might be related to how floats are handled in the context of pickling. Therefore, the primary focus should be on the `Float` class and its methods in the `numbers.py` file. Additionally, considering the nature of the error ('invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'), it might also be relevant to check for any code segments where integers are explicitly parsed or coerced, which could be found in `compatibility.py` or `expr.py`.",
