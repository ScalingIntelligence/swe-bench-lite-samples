The issue mentions the error occurring at 'File \"/Users/alex/git/VU/sympy/sympy/core/numbers.py\", line 1045, in __new__'. Examining the 'Float.__new__' function in the provided search results reveals that it handles the creation of Float instances, including conversion from various types and precision handling. The error occurred in the line that tries to convert the float component to a long with base 16 ('num[1] = long(num[1], 16)'), suggesting that this operation might not be compatible or necessary in Python 3. This diagnosis should guide the investigation and potential fix for the pickle compatibility issue.
