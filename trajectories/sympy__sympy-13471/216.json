The error occurs specifically in the Float class of the sympy library. Upon examining the search results, the most relevant code is found in 'sympy/core/numbers.py'. The 'Float' class and its methods such as '__getnewargs__', '__getstate__', '_hashable_content', '_as_mpf_op', and various '_eval_is_*' methods are directly related to handling float values and their serialization. These methods are likely involved in the pickling process and could be the source of the compatibility issue. Other parts of the search results do not directly relate to float handling or pickling in the context of sympy expressions. Therefore, the focus should be on the 'Float' class and its associated methods in 'sympy/core/numbers.py'.",

The key elements identified from the issue include: pickling a SymPy expression with a float in Python 2, unpickling it in Python 3, and the specific error related to handling floats. The error traceback indicates a problem in the '__new__' method of the 'Float' class in 'sympy/core/numbers.py'. Given this context, the relevant code spans should include those that handle float operations and conversion, especially those related to pickling and unpickling.\n\nThe search results show several spans in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' related to the 'Float' class, including '__new__', '_new', '__getnewargs__', '__getstate__', and others. These spans are directly related to object creation, pickling, and unpickling, making them relevant to the issue. However, the '__new__' span in the search results seems incomplete, lacking key components such as the return statement and some method calls. This suggests the search may need to be refined to get a more complete view of this method. Similarly, the '__getnewargs__' and '__getstate__' spans in the search results are also incomplete, which might affect the ability to fully understand how pickling is handled for 'Float' objects.\n\nThe provided context and search results are sufficient to conclude that the current spans are relevant to the reported issue, but they might not be complete enough to fully address the problem. Further search or refining of the search to get more complete code spans for '__new__', '__getnewargs__', and '__getstate__' may be necessary.",
