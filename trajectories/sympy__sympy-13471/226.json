The error trace specifies that the issue occurs in sympy/core/numbers.py at line 1045 where a ValueError is raised due to invalid hex literal for int conversion ('1L').\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in two files: sympy/core/numbers.py and sympy/core/compatibility.py. In sympy/core/numbers.py, the class Float and its methods, such as __getstate__, _hashable_content, num, _as_mpf_op, and evaluative properties like _eval_is_finite, _eval_is_negative, _eval_is_positive, and _eval_is_zero, are identified as crucial since they deal with the handling and representation of float numbers, including their serialization and metadata for hashing and evaluation properties. These methods are directly related to the float handling that might be causing the pickle serialization issue between Python 2 and 3.\n\nAdditionally, in sympy/core/compatibility.py, the as_int function and related imports dealing with Python 2 to Python 3 compatibility for integer types are important as they manage the type conversion of integers across different Python versions. Given the error in conversion ('1L' to int in Python 3), understanding the handling and conversion of integer types between versions is essential for diagnosing this issue.\n\nIdentifying these code spans is crucial to understand the implementation of float and integer handling in sympy, which is directly related to the reported pickle serialization error between Python versions.",
