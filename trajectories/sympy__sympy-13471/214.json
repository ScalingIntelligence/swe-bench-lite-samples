The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, specifically in the `Float` class method `__new__`. This points to a mismatch in how floats are handled between the two Python versions. To resolve this, we need to focus on the `Float` class methods and perhaps the conversion and compatibility logic in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/compatibility.py` files. Additionally, considering the error message about hex conversion, inspecting the float handling in sympy for potential Python version differences is crucial.",

The traceback provided points to an error in the sympy/core/numbers.py file, specifically within the `__new__` method of the `Float` class where a ValueError is raised due to an invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'. This suggests that there might be issues with how the Float class handles pickling, especially the conversion between different Python versions. In the search results, both the sympy/core/numbers.py and sympy/core/compatibility.py files contain relevant code spans. The sympy/core/compatibility.py file includes code to handle differences between Python 2 and Python 3, which is crucial for understanding and resolving the issue reported. In sympy/core/numbers.py, the `Number`, `Float`, and their respective methods like `__new__`, `__getnewargs__`, `__getstate__`, and others are directly related to the handling of float numbers and their serialization (pickling). These methods need to be reviewed to ensure they can handle the transition between Python 2 and Python 3 correctly, particularly when dealing with floats that have been serialized in Python 2 and need to be deserialized in Python 3. The issue might be addressed by either modifying these methods to handle the differences in the Python versions more gracefully or providing version-specific serialization/deserialization methods. It is important to ensure that the Float class and associated methods maintain compatibility across different Python versions, especially when it comes to pickling and unpickling operations. This involves careful handling of data types and ensuring that the conversion between different representations (like handling the '1L' incorrectly interpreted as an integer with base 16 in Python 3) is addressed.",
