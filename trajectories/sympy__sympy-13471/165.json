The error trace points to 'sympy/core/numbers.py' specifically in the 'Float' class method '__new__'. It seems that the issue lies in the handling of float conversions and possibly in the interoperation between different Python versions. To resolve this, we need to focus on the 'Float' class and its methods in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' to ensure compatibility across Python versions.",

The error traceback points to a specific part of the sympy codebase, specifically the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, where the Float class is defined and the `__new__` method is processed. The analysis of the provided search results reveals that the Float class is where the main logic for handling float numbers in sympy resides. The `__new__` method, including the handling of deprecation warnings and the creation of Float instances, is particularly relevant as it directly deals with the instantiation of float objects in sympy. The class methods and attributes such as `_new`, `__getnewargs__`, `__getstate__`, `_hashable_content`, and others, along with their detailed implementations, provide a comprehensive view of how floats are managed within the sympy context. These methods and attributes are crucial for understanding how the float instances are serialized, hashed, and interact with other numeric types, which is directly related to the issue of pickle compatibility between Python versions. The `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__div__`, and `_eval_power` methods are also relevant as they deal with arithmetic operations and how these operations might behave differently between Python versions due to changes in float representation or handling.",

Specifically, update the condition where the type of num[1] is checked to handle the conversion more robustly.\n\nThe specific condition to modify for handling hexadecimal string conversion is where the type of num[1] is checked. This occurs in lines 1041 to 1048, where the code processes a tuple input and specifically handles the case where the second element of the tuple is a string representing a hexadecimal number. The current method assumes the string is in a standard form and directly converts it to a long integer using base 16. To ensure compatibility between Python 2 and 3, this section needs to be updated to handle the conversion more robustly, possibly by using a more explicit conversion method that is compatible across both Python versions.",
