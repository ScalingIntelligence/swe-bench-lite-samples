The error message indicates a problem in the `sympy.core.numbers.py` file specifically when handling float values. The `Float` class and related methods in this file are most likely the focus of the issue. To resolve this, we need to specifically look into the `__new__` method of the `Float` class and related class methods in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file. Additionally, it's worth noting references to any float handling or conversion utilities that might exist in other parts of the codebase and could be contributing to this issue. The primary focus should be on understanding and enhancing compatibility for float handling in the context of pickling across Python versions.",
