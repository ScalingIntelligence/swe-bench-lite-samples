This points directly to the '__new__' method in the Float class as the relevant part of the codebase for addressing this issue. The __new__ method is responsible for creating new instances of the Float class and includes handling for various types of input, including floats, strings, and hexadecimal representations. Given this context, the relevant code spans are the entire __new__ method and the part of the __new__ method where hexadecimal string conversion occurs.
