The error traceback points to an issue in the `sympy.core.numbers.py` module, specifically at the `Float.__new__` method. This method is responsible for handling the creation of Float objects in sympy, including the conversion of various num types to Float. The problem seems to occur with the conversion of a hexadecimal string (possibly coming from a pickled object) to a long integer. The relevant sections of code include the imports, the Number class, and especially the Float class with its `__new__` and `_new` methods. These methods handle the conversion of different types to Float and deal with precision and normalization. The issue might be related to the way long integers are handled when they come from a hexadecimal string. Thus, the identified spans are 'imports', 'Number', 'Float', 'Float.__new__', and 'Float._new'.",

This class also includes specific handling for serialization through methods like `_as_mpf_val`, which might be involved in the pickle serialization process. Given this context, it appears that the relevant sections of code are present. Notably, the `__new__` method in the `Float` class is seen, and potential issues with int-to-long conversion during deserialization are hinted at in the case of hexadecimal string handling, which may be related to the reported pickle loading error.
