The error trace points to 'sympy/core/numbers.py' where a ValueError is raised. This suggests that the Float class and its methods, particularly those involved in handling and converting float values between Python versions, are critical areas to focus on. Furthermore, since the error involves pickle, related functions or utilities in 'sympy/core/compatibility.py' for compatibility may also be relevant. A deeper check might involve any utilities for sympifying expressions or handling special number types across versions. The search should start with focusing on the Float class handling in 'numbers.py' and the compatibility utilities in 'compatibility.py'. Functions or methods directly handling float values (like __new__ in Float or as_int in compatibility) and any direct conversions or checks for float values could be pertinent.",
