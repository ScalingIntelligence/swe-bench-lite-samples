The error points to a specific line in `numbers.py` where a conversion fails. Given this, the key area to focus on is the `Float` class in `numbers.py` and any related conversion or compatibility handling. Additional scrutiny should be given to any code responsible for handling float transformations between different Python versions, which might include compatibility utilities or sympification processes.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs at 'num[1] = long(num[1], 16)', suggesting a problem with the conversion of numeric types between Python versions. Given this, the relevant code spans in the search results appear to be those that deal with numeric type conversions and pickle serialization, particularly in the Float class within sympy/core/numbers.py. The Float class methods such as __getstate__, _as_mpf_op, and properties like num are particularly relevant as they involve numeric details and could be where the pickle serialization/deserialization process fails. Additionally, the compatibility module sympy/core/compatibility.py is also significant as it handles differences between Python 2 and 3, specifically the 'as_int' function which could be related to the error in type conversion mentioned in the traceback. Overall, these sections of code seem to directly relate to the reported issue of pickle failing with float-containing expressions when transitioning between Python versions.",

The error trace points to the 'Rational' class, specifically the '__new__' method in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' as the source of the error. The current context includes spans from 'sympy/core/numbers.py', notably the 'Float' and 'Rational' classes, and from 'sympy/core/compatibility.py', relevant for understanding Python version compatibility.\n\nThe new search results primarily add additional methods within the 'Float' class in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' that handle float operations, such as '__getnewargs__', 'ceiling', 'num', '_as_mpf_op', and various _eval_is_* methods. These methods are relevant as they deal with the representation and behavior of floats, which is central to the issue at hand.\n\nAdditionally, new spans in 'sympy/core/compatibility.py' provide further context on Python version compatibility utilities, particularly 'ordered' and 'lru_cache', which, while not directly related to the float handling issue, are part of the broader compatibility framework in sympy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified and extracted from the new search results.",

In `numbers.py`, the `Float` class methods such as `__getstate__`, `_as_mpf_op`, and `_eval_power` are particularly notable as they handle the internal state and arithmetic operations involving floats, which could potentially impact serialization and deserialization processes. Additionally, the `compatibility.py` file delineates how certain modules and functions are adapted or modified based on the Python version, indicating a direct management of version-specific behaviors that could affect how `Float` objects are handled, especially in cross-version scenarios. These details are crucial for understanding how the library attempts to maintain consistency and functionality across different Python environments. Further investigation into these methods and how they are utilized in conjunction with pickling mechanisms could yield a solution or reveal the underlying cause of the issue reported.",
