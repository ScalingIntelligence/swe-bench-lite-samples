The error occurs during the unpickling process in Python 3, specifically in the handling of float values. This suggests that the problem might lie in how sympy handles float values and their serialization. To locate the code causing the issue, we should focus on the sympy/core/numbers.py file, where the Float class is defined, since the traceback points to an error in this module. Additionally, the sympy/core/sympify.py file might be relevant due to its role in type conversion.",

To resolve this, it is important to identify and analyze the methods in the 'Float' class that are involved in pickling and unpickling operations, as well as any methods that handle float conversions or comparisons. The search results show multiple methods within the 'Float' class that could be relevant, such as '__getnewargs__', '__getstate__', '_as_mpf_op', '_eval_is_finite', '_eval_is_infinite', '_eval_is_negative', '_eval_is_positive', and '_eval_is_zero'. These methods are likely to be involved in the serialization and deserialization processes, as well as in the handling of float values. Additionally, the 'sympify' function in 'sympy/core/sympify.py' is relevant as it converts various types into SymPy types, potentially including float types that could be involved in the pickle operations.",
