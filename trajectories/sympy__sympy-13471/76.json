The relevant code is likely in the sympy.core.numbers module, particularly the Float class, where the error traceback points to a line involving '__new__' method of the Float class. Other relevant files are sympy.core.compatibility, which could include functions or classes that interface with system-level or numeric operations that might affect pickle serialization across Python versions, and sympy.core.expr, which may have related numerical evaluation and conversion methods. Additionally, sympy.printing modules might also be relevant if they convert Float objects to strings or other formats that could relate to serialization or deserialization issues.",

The search results include several relevant spans in this file, notably the `Float`, `Float.__new__`, and `Float._new` methods. These methods handle the initialization and conversion of Float objects, which are likely where the incompatibility arises. The `sympy/core/compatibility.py` file also contains relevant spans, particularly the `as_int` function and the code dealing with Python version differences, which might influence how floats are handled. The `sympy/core/expr.py` file, while not directly related to Float, contains general expression handling and conversion methods (`__int__`, `__float__`, `__complex__`), which might be indirectly relevant to understanding the context of float handling in sympy. Overall, the identified spans in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/compatibility.py` are likely the most directly related to the reported issue.",

Additionally, the 'sympy/core/compatibility.py' file is relevant for understanding the differences in handling between Python 2 and Python 3, especially since it includes utilities for type compatibility across Python versions, which is a possible source of the issue.
