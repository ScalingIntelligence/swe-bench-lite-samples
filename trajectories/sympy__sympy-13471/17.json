The search results include several spans of code from `sympy/core/numbers.py`, most notably the `Float.__new__` span, which contains the code involved in creating a new `Float` object, including handling for various types of input numbers, such as strings, floats, and tuples. This span is directly relevant to the issue as it deals with the conversion and normalization of floating-point numbers, which could be where the incompatibility arises when crossing between Python versions. The span also includes handling for hexadecimal strings, which could be related to the pickling issue if pickles involve such strings.
