The error trace points to the `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, specifically a problem in the `__new__` method of the `Float` class. This suggests that the issue is likely within the `Float` class's methods or how it handles the conversion between Python 2 and Python 3, especially regarding float representations. Additionally, the `sympy/core/compatibility.py` file could contain relevant compatibility functions or utilities that might affect this process. Therefore, I am searching for references to the `Float` class and its methods in `numbers.py` and for any compatibility utility functions in `compatibility.py`. I am also looking for any other related functions or configurations in Python 2 vs Python 3 contexts.",
