The search results confirm the presence of this method, which includes code handling the conversion of various types of 'num' arguments (including strings, floats, tuples, etc.) to an appropriate 'Float' representation. The error mentioned in the traceback is related to the conversion of a hexadecimal string to a Python long integer. This suggests that the issue likely arises from the unpickling process in Python 3 where the '__new__' method encounters a tuple representation that it does not handle correctly.

The relevant code spans in the search results include the entire Float class definition, particularly the __new__ method which is crucial for understanding how floats are created and handled in sympy. This method includes handling for different types of input, including floats, strings, and sympy-specific types, and it involves the conversion of decimal.Decimal objects and numpy types. The method also deals with the precision and normalization of the float representation. Additional relevant spans include the _new method, which further handles the normalization, and the __getnewargs__ and __getstate__ methods, which are related to object serialization, possibly relevant to the pickle operation. Other spans such as the arithmetic operations (__add__, __sub__, __mul__, __mod__, __rmod__) and evaluation methods (_as_mpf_op, _eval_is_negative, _eval_is_positive, etc.) might be useful for context but are not directly relevant to the pickle issue at hand.

The issue reported likely arises from the line in `__new__` where it tries to convert the hexadecimal string to a long integer, which seems to be the point of failure when unpickling in Python 3. The `_as_mpf_val` and `_new` methods are also relevant as they involve the precision handling and normalization of the `mpf` data which is central to the `Float` type's representation.

Instead of using `long(num[1], 16)`, we should use `int(num[1], 16)` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.\n\nThe instructions specify modifying the `__new__` method to handle a tuple where the second element is a hexadecimal string, specifically changing `long(num[1], 16)` to `int(num[1], 16)`. This modification should be made in the block that handles tuples specifically. The line to be changed is easily identifiable as the one using `long(num[1], 16)` within the tuple handling part of the method.",
