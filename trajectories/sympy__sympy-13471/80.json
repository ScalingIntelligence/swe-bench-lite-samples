The error trace points to the `numbers.py` file, specifically the `Float` class and its methods, hinting that the problem might be related to how floats are handled or serialized in sympy. Additionally, the `compatibility.py` file, which contains utilities for handling differences between Python versions, could also be relevant. I will search for the `Float` class and related methods in `numbers.py` and also look at the `compatibility.py` file for any utilities that might help resolve the issue.",

This suggests a direct relevance to the reported issue. The search results include several spans from the `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, which are likely relevant for addressing the issue. These spans cover various methods of the `Float` class, including methods related to pickling (`__getnewargs__`, `__getstate__`), hash content (`_hashable_content`), and numerical properties (`_eval_is_finite`, `_eval_is_infinite`, `_eval_is_negative`, `_eval_is_positive`, `_eval_is_zero`, `__nonzero__`). Additionally, the `sympy/core/compatibility.py` file contains utilities for compatibility between Python versions, which might also be relevant for translating the pickled data between versions.
