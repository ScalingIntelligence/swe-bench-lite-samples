Analyzing the provided search results, it is evident that the spans related to the Float class, specifically the '__new__' span, are directly relevant to the reported issue. The '__new__' span contains the implementation responsible for creating a Float object, which is where the conversion from Python 2 to Python 3 semantics might be failing. Additionally, the spans related to the Integer class such as '_as_mpf_val', '__divmod__', and '__rdivmod__' are indirectly relevant as they provide context on how integers are handled in the numbers module, which could also be contributing to the issue when dealing with float-containing expressions. Therefore, focusing on the Float class and its '__new__' method is crucial for resolving the issue.",
