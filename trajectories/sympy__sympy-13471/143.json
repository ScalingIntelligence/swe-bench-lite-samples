The error trace points to the `numbers.py` file within the sympy/core directory, specifically to the `Float` class and its methods. Searching for the exact error message 'ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'' can help pinpoint the problematic code. Additionally, investigating all occurrences of the `Float` class to understand its usage across different Python versions is crucial. The `sympify.py` file, which handles type conversions and sympification, might also be relevant as it could affect how floats are handled during pickling. Lastly, the `evalf.py` file, dealing with numerical evaluation, could yield insights into float handling specifics. Thus, two searches are initiated: one focusing on the specific error message in the `numbers.py` file and another to cover broader float handling in the `Float` class across the repository.",
