The traceback points to `sympy/core/numbers.py` and specifically the `Float` class. Upon examining the code, it is clear that the `Float` class is central to handling float values in sympy. The issue mentioned in the traceback, `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'`, suggests a problem with how floats are handled during unpickling. The relevant code spans include the `Float` class definition and its methods, particularly those involved in creating new `Float` instances and handling conversions between different types (like from string, decimal, or mpmath.mpf). These methods are crucial for understanding how floats are processed and potentially how they might cause issues during cross-Python version operations. Therefore, the identified spans include the import statements, the `Float` class definition, and its methods `__new__`, `_new`, `__getnewargs__`, `__getstate__`, and `_hashable_content`. These spans collectively provide the context necessary to understand and fix the issue.",
