The issue is highlighted in the `Float.__new__` method in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, where the conversion of floats between Python versions is causing a ValueError: 'invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'. This suggests that the long integer type ('1L') from Python 2 is not being correctly interpreted in Python 3, leading to a pickle load failure. Given this context, reviewing the newly provided search results is necessary to see if there's additional relevant code or potential fixes for the compatibility issue.",

The context provided includes the Float class definition and its methods, which handle the conversion, representation, and arithmetic operations of floats. The error trace in the issue suggests that the problem might be within the unpickling process, potentially involving the conversion of a hexadecimal string to an integer. The provided code in the Float class includes handling for various types of inputs, including handling during pickling (__getstate__) and unpickling (construction from a tuple). The presence of these methods and the detailed handling of different input types indicates that the relevant code for addressing the issue is likely present in the file context, especially considering the detailed checks and conversions within the Float class. Additionally, the code includes methods specifically for binary and decimal precision handling, which are crucial for cross-version compatibility.
