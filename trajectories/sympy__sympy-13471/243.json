The traceback provided indicates that the error occurs in the `__new__` method of the `Float` class within `sympy/core/numbers.py`. The error is specifically related to the conversion of a hexadecimal value to an integer, suggesting a compatibility issue between how floats are handled in Python 2 vs. Python 3. I will focus on identifying the relevant code spans that deal with the creation and processing of float values, as well as any conversion logic, particularly where it involves handling Python 2 to Python 3 compatibility. Additionally, I will look for any specific handling or settings related to pickling and unpickling operations within the code spans. Based on the search results, the relevant spans appear to be related to the `Float` class, specifically the `__new__` method and the handling of specific types like strings and tuples, which could be the points where unpickling might fail in Python 3.",
