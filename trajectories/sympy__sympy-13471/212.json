This functionality is crucial for the pickle module to correctly interpret the pickled data. After examining the code spans in the search results, it is evident that the spans related to the Float class and its methods such as __new__, _new, and the methods for arithmetic operations (__add__, __div__, __mod__, etc.) are directly related to the handling of float values in sympy. These are likely the places where the code needs adjustments to ensure compatibility between Python versions. The Integer class is also relevant, especially the _as_mpf_val method which converts an Integer to a format suitable for mpmath, a library used for arbitrary precision arithmetic in sympy. The presence of the Float class with its methods and the Integer class handling precision might be involved in the compatibility issue, necessitating adjustments or additional compatibility layers when handling pickled data across Python versions.",
