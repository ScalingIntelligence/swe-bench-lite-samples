The current implementation does not handle duplicates appropriately as seen in the example provided. The solution suggests removing duplicates at the outset of instantiation and possibly canonicalizing the order for consistent processing. The relevant files identified for this issue are primarily related to set operations, including sympy/sets/sets.py, sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py, and possibly sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py for handling complex conditions. Furthermore, the Intersection class in sympy/sets/sets.py contains methods related to intersections, and sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py contains specific dispatch methods for intersections. Hence, focusing on these files and specifically on the Intersection class and its related methods in sets.py and handlers/intersection.py should help resolve the issue.",
