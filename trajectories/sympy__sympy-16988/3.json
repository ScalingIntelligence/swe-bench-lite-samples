The Piecewise class from sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise is also mentioned in the issue but is not directly relevant to the code in the Intersection class. The _handle_finite_sets method is focused on handling finite sets within intersections, and it already appears to consider the containment of elements across sets. This suggests that the current implementation might already address some aspects of duplicate removal. However, the exact logic for removing duplicates during the instantiation of Intersection objects is not explicitly detailed. The __new__ method of Intersection does not show an explicit removal of duplicates during instantiation, but it does call _new_args_filter which might handle this implicitly. Given the existing complexity and the potential for this logic to be distributed across several methods or not yet implemented, it's reasonable to consider the file context as potentially incomplete regarding this specific issue.",
