The desired behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and potentially order them for canonical processing. The relevant files and classes have already been provided, including 'Intersection' class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py'. To proceed, we should focus on the '__new__' method of the Intersection class and the '_handle_finite_sets' static method, as these are likely places where duplicates could be removed. Additionally, reviewing the 'simplify_intersection' function in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' might be relevant for handling intersections involving duplicates. Finally, inspecting the 'intersection_sets' function in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' for how it handles sets may also be insightful.",
