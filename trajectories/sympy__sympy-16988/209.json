It expects that Intersection should return a Piecewise expression or remain unevaluated rather than returning EmptySet or disregarding duplicates. The solution is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and order them to ensure canonical processing.\n2. Review Current Context: The current file context provided includes several spans from `sympy/sets/sets.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. The relevant spans include parts of the Intersection class and its methods (`__new__`, `args`, `is_iterable`, `_inf`, `_sup`, `_contains`, `__iter__`, `as_relational`) and the simplify_intersection function. In `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, there are spans from the Piecewise class, including its `__new__`, `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_simplify`, `_handle_irel`, `_eval_interval`, `_intervals`, `_eval_nseries`, and `_eval_power` methods.\n3. Process New Search Results: The new search results include additional spans in `sympy/sets/sets.py` (simplify_intersection function) and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` (Piecewise class methods, particularly `__new__`, `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_simplify`, `_handle_irel`, `_eval_interval`, `_intervals`, `_eval_nseries`, and `_eval_power`). These additional spans are relevant to understanding how Intersection and Piecewise functions handle duplicates and conditions, which is crucial for solving the reported issue.\n4.
