The provided search results contain several relevant spans of code from the sympy/sets/sets.py file, which define the Intersection class and its methods. The spans of code include the Intersection class definition, its __new__ method, and other methods like _handle_finite_sets and __iter__. These methods are crucial for understanding the logic behind the Intersection class and how it handles set operations, including the removal of duplicates. The current context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet, so these spans are likely to be pertinent to the issue at hand. The search results also include code spans from other classes like Union, FiniteSet, and Interval, which might be indirectly related to the Intersection class's behavior.\n\nGiven the analysis, the relevant code spans identified are those directly related to the Intersection class's operations and methods. The __new__ method of Intersection, the _handle_finite_sets method, and the __iter__ method are particularly relevant as they deal with the instantiation, simplification, and iteration logic of intersections, which align with the issue of removing duplicates. This initial search suggests that these spans could provide a solid foundation for further investigation into how duplicates are handled and can be addressed to meet the requirements specified in the issue. It is important to note that while these spans are relevant, more comprehensive analysis, including testing and possibly modifying the code, would be necessary to ensure the issue is fully resolved.",
