The goal is to ensure that duplicates are handled correctly during instantiation and that the intersection operation should give consistent results irrespective of duplicate elements. Additionally, the result should be returned in a canonical form, potentially using Piecewise to handle conditional results. The relevant files and methods to investigate are `sympy/sets/sets.py` (specifically the Intersection class), `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` (for intersection handling logic), and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` (for Piecewise handling).",

These methods handle the creation, evaluation, and simplification of Piecewise objects, which are expected outputs as per the reported issue.\n   - This code is relevant for implementing the desired behavior where the Intersection function should return a Piecewise object based on conditions.\n\n3. **sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py**\n   - The **intersection_sets** function, which seems to handle specific cases of intersection.\n   - While this code does not directly address the main issue, it is part of the intersection handling mechanism and might be relevant for understanding the broader context or for potential modifications.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, addressing both the Intersection functionality and the expected Piecewise output.
