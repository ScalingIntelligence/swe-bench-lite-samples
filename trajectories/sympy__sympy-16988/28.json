The provided search results contain several relevant code spans, particularly in the definition of the Intersection class and related functions such as '__new__', '_handle_finite_sets', and 'simplify_intersection'. These spans detail the creation of Intersection objects, handling of finite sets within intersections, and simplification logic. These parts of the code are relevant because they deal directly with the intersection logic, which is central to the reported issue. However, the search results do not explicitly address the handling of duplicates within intersection operations, suggesting that the complete solution might require additional implementation or modification of the existing code to ensure duplicates are removed or appropriately handled. Given the relevance of the identified spans to the intersection functionality and the need to address duplicates, these spans are deemed highly relevant to the reported issue. Additional implementation might be needed to fully address the issue of handling duplicates in Intersections.",
