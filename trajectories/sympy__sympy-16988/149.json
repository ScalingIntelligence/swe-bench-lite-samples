The desired behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and potentially order them for canonical processing. Given the context, the focus should be on the Intersection class and related methods in the sets module. Additionally, the Piecewise class might be relevant for representing the intersection results conditionally. The search should primarily target the sympy/sets/sets.py file and the Intersection class within it.",

Specifically, it requires that duplicates should be removed and the intersection should return a Piecewise object based on conditions. The Intersection class is found in the first file provided (sympy/sets/sets.py) under the 'Intersection' span. This class is responsible for handling set intersections, which is the core concern of the reported issue. The second file (sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py) contains the Piecewise class, which is the desired output format when handling duplicates and conditions. Since the issue directly involves correcting the behavior of the Intersection class and ensuring it returns the proper Piecewise output, both the Intersection class and the Piecewise class are relevant to solving this issue.
