The `_handle_finite_sets` method is also relevant as it deals with handling finite sets, which could be where duplicates should be removed. For the Piecewise class, multiple methods are relevant as they handle the construction and evaluation of piecewise functions, which are expected outputs for the Intersection class based on the reported issue.
