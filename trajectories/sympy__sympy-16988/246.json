The desired output should handle duplicates appropriately, potentially by removing them at the outset. The search results primarily focus on the `Intersection` class within the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file and related set operations. I've identified several key parts of the code that are directly relevant to understanding and possibly fixing the issue with duplication handling. These include the `Intersection.__new__` method, the `Intersection.args` property, the `Intersection._contains` method, the `Intersection.__iter__` method, and the `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` static method. Each of these parts of the code deals with different aspects of the intersection operation and could potentially be the place where the handling of duplicates is implemented or should be implemented. The `ProductSet`, `Interval`, `Union`, `Complement`, `FiniteSet`, and `SymmetricDifference` classes and their respective `__new__` methods are also relevant for understanding the context in which `Intersection` operates.",

Additionally, reviewing the `simplify_intersection` function could be beneficial as it simplifies the intersection of sets, which might also involve handling duplicates in its logic.

However, these methods are key to understanding how intersections are simplified and processed in the SymPy library. The `_handle_finite_sets` method deals with finite sets among the arguments to the intersection, and it uses a variety of techniques to reduce the sets involved. While it does not explicitly check for or remove duplicates, it does use set operations that implicitly handle unique elements. The `simplify_intersection` function goes through potential simplifications including recognizing an empty set or involving unions and complements in the simplification process. Since duplicates are inherently handled by ensuring unique elements in sets, there does not appear to be a need for explicit duplicate handling in these methods.
