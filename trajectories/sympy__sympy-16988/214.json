The goal is to ensure that duplicates are removed during instantiation and the result should either be a Piecewise expression or remain unevaluated. Given the context and files provided, the Intersection class and its associated methods in sympy/sets/sets.py are likely places to start. The intersection_sets handlers in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py should also be examined for how intersections are processed. Additionally, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py might be relevant for constructing the desired output.",

These methods will be useful for implementing the desired functionality of returning a Piecewise expression based on conditions met by the intersection.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to addressing the core issue of handling intersections and constructing Piecewise expressions to represent results.",
