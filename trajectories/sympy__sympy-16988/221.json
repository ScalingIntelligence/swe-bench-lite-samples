The 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file contains the 'Intersection' class definition along with its '__new__' method, which is responsible for instantiating the Intersection object. This method includes logic for simplifying the intersection of sets. Additionally, the 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' method handles the intersection of finite sets, which is relevant for dealing with duplicates and ordering. The 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' file contains the 'Piecewise' class, which is useful for constructing the desired output using Piecewise expressions. Based on the provided context and search results, the 'Intersection' class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and the 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.
