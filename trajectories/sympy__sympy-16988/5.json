Initial inspection suggests that the Intersection class method `__new__` or the static method `_handle_finite_sets` might be potential locations for handling the removal of duplicates. Additionally, understanding how Piecewise is involved in the desired output could also be crucial for solving this issue. Given the described behavior, it's reasonable to focus the search on methods related to intersection handling within the sets module and possibly on the Piecewise class. The intersection_sets function in the handlers directory could also be relevant due to its specific role in intersection operations.",

The provided search results contain several key sections that are relevant to this issue:\n1. The `Intersection` class definition and its `__new__` method, which controls the instantiation of Intersection objects and includes logic for evaluation.\n2. The `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` static method, which deals with the intersection of finite sets, a critical part for handling duplicates and potentially where the fix should be applied.\n3. The `simplify_intersection` function, which simplifies the intersection of sets and could potentially be used to adapt the behavior according to the reported issue.\n4. The `FiniteSet` class, which is essential for representing sets that might contain duplicates.\nGiven these findings, it is clear that the identified code spans have direct relevance to the reported issue, particularly in how duplicates are managed and intersected.

The issue involves providing the correct response or leaving it unevaluated for certain intersections involving sets and variables.\n\nFirst, I reviewed the current file context provided, which primarily involves the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file. This file already contains various relevant code spans related to the Intersection class, methods for handling finite sets within intersections, and the intersection simplification function. Additionally, I noticed that the sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py file contains dispatch functions for handling specific intersection scenarios, which could be relevant.\n\nNext, I processed the newly provided search results. These included further details from the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file regarding intersection handling, complement operations, and the Interval, Union, and FiniteSet classes. Also, there was additional context about how to simplify intersections and how to handle finite sets, which could be directly related to the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, it appears that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file and involve methods within the Intersection class and related utility functions. Specifically, the '_handle_finite_sets' method and the 'simplify_intersection' function, along with various other methods for complement and intersection operations, seem to be directly related to addressing the reported issue.\n\nThe provided search results do not introduce any significant new files or spans beyond what was already identified in the file context. Therefore, I believe that the identified spans from 'sympy/sets/sets.py' should address the reported issue effectively, without the need for additional search tasks.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
