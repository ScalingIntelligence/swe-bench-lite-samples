            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the `Intersection` function in handling duplicates. The expected behavior is for the intersection to remove duplicates and either return a `Piecewise` result or remain unevaluated. The current search results provide relevant code spans that are crucial for understanding and modifying the `Intersection` function. \n\nThe `Intersection` class is found, which is central to the issue. Within this class, the `__new__` method initializes the intersection operation and handles the evaluation. This method appears relevant as it controls how the intersection is instantiated and simplified. The `_handle_finite_sets` static method is also key, as it specifically processes intersections involving finite sets, which likely includes handling duplicates. The method sorts the finite sets by length and processes each element to determine its presence in the resulting set, which aligns with the need to remove duplicates. \n\nAdditionally, the `simplify_intersection` function is important as it simplifies the intersection arguments, which could involve removing duplicates or processing sets in a manner that respects the need for canonical results. The existence of other set types like `FiniteSet` and the use of functions to handle intersections (`intersection_sets`) further indicates the breadth of the codebase's handling of set operations. \n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the code spans related to `Intersection`, 'FiniteSet', and set handling functions like `_handle_finite_sets` and `simplify_intersection` are all highly relevant to addressing the reported problem. These spans not only show how the intersection operation is implemented but also how it interacts with other set operations, which could be crucial for comprehensive handling of duplicates and set intersections.",

The `__new__` method and the `_handle_finite_sets` static method are directly involved in these operations, as they define how intersections are created and how finite sets within intersections are managed.
