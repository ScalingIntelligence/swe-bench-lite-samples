The provided code snippets suggest that the Intersection class might need adjustments to its __new__ method or its _handle_finite_sets static method to properly address duplicates. Additionally, the Piecewise class and its handling of expressions involving set intersections should be considered, especially in the context of returning a Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True)) result or an unevaluated intersection. Given the relevance of these classes and methods, further investigation is needed in their respective implementations.",

The issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that the intersection routine should handle duplicates appropriately.\n\n1. **Intersection Class**: The Intersection class is directly relevant as it pertains to the main operation of interest (finding intersections of sets). We need to look at methods that manage how intersections are computed and how duplicates might be involved in these computations.\n2. **FiniteSet Class**: This class is relevant because it deals with the basic entity (a set) that can have duplicates. We need to inspect how elements are added and managed within a FiniteSet.\n3. **Piecewise Class**: The Piecewise class is relevant because it can be the form of output when conditions for intersection involve variable elements (as suggested by the Piecewise example in the issue).\n\nWith this in mind, we need to examine code spans that involve instantiation, the actual intersection calculation, handling of finite sets, and the structure of returned results (like Piecewise).\n\nWe have identified significant spans within these classes that are likely directly relevant to the issue. From the Intersection class, methods like `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `__iter__` are critical as they involve the actual intersection process and how sets of elements are handled during intersection. Within the FiniteSet class, the `__new__` method is important for understanding how sets are instantiated and might handle duplicates. Finally, the Piecewise class's methods are crucial for ensuring that the output of intersection operations can handle conditional logic based on the presence of variable elements, similar to the example given in the issue description.",

The issue mentions that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and suggests using Piecewise for evaluating conditions. I then reviewed the current file context, which includes relevant parts of sympy/sets/sets.py and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, focusing on code spans related to Intersection and Piecewise. I proceeded to analyze the new search results, which also provide additional code spans from these files. I identified the relevant code spans in the search results by matching them with the key elements from the issue, such as Intersection handling duplicates and Piecewise for condition evaluation. I found relevant spans in both files that could be useful for addressing the issue. These spans include relevant methods such as __new__, __iter__, and _handle_finite_sets in the Intersection class, and methods like __new__, eval, doit, and _eval_simplify in the Piecewise class. Based on the analysis, the search task is not yet complete, as some parts of the codebase, particularly related to how duplicates are handled and how the conditions are evaluated using Piecewise, need further exploration.",

The Intersection class lacks explicit handling for duplicates within its __new__ and _handle_finite_sets methods. The Piecewise class, on the other hand, has methods such as _eval_simplify and _eval_integral that need to be examined for their ability to correctly handle intersections involving duplicates. The _eval_simplify method appears capable of simplifying conditions and the expression for equalities that are part of the condition, and the _eval_integral method is designed to handle piecewise functions integration. Both methods should be reviewed for how they deal with set intersections, potentially involving duplicates, to ensure that the handling is accurate and effective.",
