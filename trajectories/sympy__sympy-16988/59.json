Specifically, it expects the intersection result to remove duplicates and possibly return a `Piecewise` expression based on certain conditions. The `Intersection` class and its methods, along with the `simplify_intersection` function, are directly relevant to addressing the issue. These parts of the code handle the creation and evaluation of intersection sets, which are central to the reported problem. On the other hand, the `Piecewise` class and its methods in `piecewise.py` are relevant as they are likely used to construct the desired `Piecewise` output mentioned in the issue. These pieces of code are crucial for understanding how intersections are currently handled and for proposing changes to meet the new requirements. Since the search results include all the relevant code necessary for addressing the issue, the task of identifying relevant code spans is considered complete.",
