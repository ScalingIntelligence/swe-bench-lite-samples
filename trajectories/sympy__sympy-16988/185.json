The requirement is to ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation and that the intersection operation should handle duplicates appropriately. Given the provided file context, it's evident that the Intersection class is defined in 'sympy/sets/sets.py'. Additionally, the 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' file contains specific intersection handlers that might need to be reviewed for proper handling of duplicates. It's also worth noting the 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' file where the Piecewise class is defined, as the desired output involves Piecewise expressions. Therefore, focusing on these files and specifically on the Intersection class methods and related handlers should help in identifying the necessary code to address this issue.",

The desired behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and order them for canonical processing. The search results contain relevant code spans in the Intersection class definition within 'sympy/sets/sets.py'. Specifically, the 'Intersection.__new__' span handles the instantiation and evaluation of intersection arguments, which is likely where the duplicate removal logic should be implemented or adjusted. Additionally, the 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' span handles finite sets, which could also be a relevant place to ensure duplicates are handled correctly. The 'simplify_intersection' function is responsible for simplifying intersections, and it uses 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets'. This function is also likely relevant for managing duplicates. Overall, these spans provide a good starting point to address the issue. The 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' is not directly relevant to the issue but is conceptually similar in managing conditional logic, which might be useful for understanding how conditional expressions are handled in SymPy.",

The provided file context (`sympy/sets/sets.py`) contains several spans of code that are relevant to how `Intersection` is implemented, including the `__new__` method and the `_handle_finite_sets` method. The `__new__` method controls the instantiation of the `Intersection` class and includes logic for handling the evaluation of the intersection operation, which includes filtering arguments to remove duplicates. The `_handle_finite_sets` method contains further logic on how to handle intersections involving finite sets, which is crucial for the reported issue due to the mention of removing duplicates at the outset. The search results from `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` provide additional insights into how different types of sets are handled during intersection operations. These include various dispatch functions that handle intersections between different types of sets and could potentially affect the logic related to duplicates. Overall, the code spans from both the file context and the search results are highly relevant to addressing the issue of removing duplicates during the `Intersection` operation in SymPy.",

This method could be a key area to review in order to handle duplicates appropriately, as it involves the manipulation of finite sets potentially containing duplicates. It is mentioned in the issue that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation, potentially within the `__new__` method of the Intersection class.

The provided context and search results contain several key code spans that are relevant to understanding and potentially addressing this issue. These include the Intersection class definition, the __new__ method, and the _handle_finite_sets method within the Intersection class. These parts of the code are responsible for the instantiation of Intersection objects, the evaluation of intersection operations, and the handling of finite sets within intersections, which directly relate to the reported issue. Additionally, the simplify_intersection function is crucial as it simplifies the intersection results, which could involve removing duplicates. The analysis of these code spans will help in determining how to improve the handling of duplicates during the intersection operation.",
