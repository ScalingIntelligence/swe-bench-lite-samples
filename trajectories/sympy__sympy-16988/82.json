From the provided search results, several relevant code spans were identified. These include the `Intersection` class and its related methods, such as `__new__`, `__iter__`, and `_handle_finite_sets`, which are central to handling the intersection logic. Additionally, the `FiniteSet` class and its methods, such as `_complement`, are relevant because they deal with the construction and manipulation of finite sets, which could include handling duplicates during instantiation or intersection operations. Furthermore, the `simplify_intersection` function, which is responsible for simplifying intersection operations, is also relevant to the reported issue as it processes intersections and could potentially be altered to account for duplicates. By analyzing these code spans, we can determine that they are closely related to the intersection operations and handling of sets within SymPy, making them key points of focus for addressing the reported issue.",

The `__new__` method calls `simplify_intersection` if the `evaluate` flag is set, which further checks for intersections involving finite sets using the `_handle_finite_sets` method. This method appears suitable for implementing logic to handle finite sets and potentially remove duplicates. The provided file context includes the necessary methods (`_handle_finite_sets` and `simplify_intersection`) and classes (`Intersection`, `FiniteSet`) to implement or verify the logic for removing duplicates in intersections. Thus, it seems that all relevant code is identified for addressing the reported issue.",
