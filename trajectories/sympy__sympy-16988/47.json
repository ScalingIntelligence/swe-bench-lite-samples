This suggests that the problem lies within the Intersection class and its handling of input sets. Two main areas to focus on are the `__new__` method and `_handle_finite_sets` static method in the Intersection class, as these are likely responsible for initial processing and handling of finite sets respectively. Further, the `intersection_sets` function in the `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` file should be reviewed to ensure correct intersection logic. Piecewise function definitions may also need to be checked for how they handle intersections with duplicates.",

Additionally, the '_handle_finite_sets' method is relevant as it processes finite sets during the intersection operation. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the current behavior to address the issue of removing duplicates. Furthermore, the 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' is identified as relevant for the expected output, providing a framework for conditional evaluation of set operations, which aligns with the piecewise evaluation mentioned in the issue description. This analysis suggests that the identified spans are critical for resolving the reported issue.",

Additionally, the `__new__` method of the Intersection class is responsible for initial processing and includes sorting and simplifying intersections, which could be related to handling duplicates. Also, the `simplify_intersection` function is designed to manage intersections among sets, pointing towards the presence of code that could be modified to address the issue of removing duplicates at the intersection level. Piecewise function definitions are not directly involved in handling duplicates in intersections based on the present context. Thus, the relevant parts of the codebase for addressing the issue are included, though further detailed implementation of removing duplicates specifically within the intersection logic would need to be defined in the context of the existing methods.",
