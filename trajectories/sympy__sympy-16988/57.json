The expected behavior is for duplicates to be removed, and the result should match the provided example or remain unevaluated. From the context and the issue description, it's likely that the Intersection class and its methods, especially '__new__' and '_handle_finite_sets', are involved in how duplicates are currently handled. Additionally, the Piecewise class might be involved in representing the result. The focus should be on the sympy/sets/sets.py and possibly sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py files.",
