The initial guess is that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation, and ordering them will produce canonical processing. The relevant classes and methods appear to be located in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. Need to focus the search on the `Intersection` class methods and the `Piecewise` class.",

The expected output should either provide a `Piecewise` result or remain unevaluated if the intersection involves unknown elements like `{x}`. To address this, it's crucial to identify the existing `Intersection` class and its methods in the `sympy.sets.sets` module, focusing on methods responsible for instantiation, evaluation, and handling of subsets. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class in `sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise` should be considered as it might be used to construct the desired output format.\n\n1. **Intersection Class Analysis**: The `Intersection` class is found in the `sympy.sets.sets` module. Important spans include the `__new__` method which handles instantiation, and `_handle_finite_sets` which deals with intersection logic for finite sets. These methods are crucial as they cover the processing of intersection input and handling of duplicates.\n\n2. **Piecewise Class Analysis**: The `Piecewise` class in `sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise` is essential for constructing conditional outputs. The `__new__` method is particularly relevant as it constructs the `Piecewise` object, which might be how the final result of the intersection operation is formatted.\n\nBy focusing on these methods and classes, we can effectively identify the areas of the codebase that need attention to implement the desired behavior regarding intersection handling and duplicate removal.",
