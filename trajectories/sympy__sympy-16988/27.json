The issue specifically mentions the routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present, which implies the need to ensure duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering the sets might also help in producing canonical processing. Additionally, understanding how Piecewise class is used in context of sets might be relevant for forming a comprehensive solution.",

Additionally, the Piecewise class from the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file, which is used to represent the Piecewise function, should be considered for integration in handling cases where the intersection result depends on a condition, such as `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))`.
