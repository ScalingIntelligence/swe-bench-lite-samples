Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function is relevant as it appears to handle the simplification of intersection operations, potentially where duplicates could be removed or managed.

The user provided examples and expected results suggest that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that the intersection result should handle symbolic expressions appropriately. The file context provided includes various spans from the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file, particularly focusing on the `Intersection` class and related methods. The new search results also provide additional spans from the same file, covering additional methods and classes in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file. To address the issue, it's essential to focus on the `Intersection` class and its methods, notably `__new__`, `__iter__`, and `_handle_finite_sets`, as well as the `simplify_intersection` function, which is directly relevant to intersection evaluation. Additionally, handling of symbolic elements within intersections should be considered, which is present in the `_handle_finite_sets` method. Based on the relevance of these spans to the issue reported, they should be considered as identified relevant code spans.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
