The Piecewise class is relevant because it deals with conditional expressions, which could be used to handle the removal of duplicates. The Piecewise.eval method is of particular interest as it contains logic for evaluating conditional expressions and could be adapted to handle duplicates in sets during its evaluation. Additionally, the _handle_irel method is relevant as it deals with handling inequalities and could potentially be extended to handle the removal of duplicates in sets based on set relations.",

These spans handle the core logic of intersection operations and managing finite sets, which aligns with the issue's requirement for removing duplicates. In the second file, code spans handle specific types of intersections, including intervals and ranges, which is crucial for correctly evaluating and simplifying intersections as per the issue.
