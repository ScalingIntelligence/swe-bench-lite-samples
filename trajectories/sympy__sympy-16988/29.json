The focus should be on the `__new__` method of the `Intersection` class and the static method `_handle_finite_sets` in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, as well as any related intersection handling in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`.",

Furthermore, the expected outcome for `Intersection({1}, {1}, {x})` should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated, suggesting the need to review the logic for handling such intersections, possibly involving a check for duplicates or the addition of new conditions to handle the piecewise evaluation.\n\nFrom the search results, the following code spans are most relevant:\n1. `Intersection.__new__` for the instantiation handling.\n2. `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` for the specific handling of finite sets where duplicates might be removed.\n3. `simplify_intersection` as it might need modifications based on how intersections are simplified.\n4. Additional methods such as `Intersection._contains`, `Intersection.is_iterable`, and properties like `Intersection.identity` and `Intersection.zero` could also be useful for understanding or augmenting the intersection behavior.\n\nThis selection aligns with the issue's requirement to ensure duplicates are managed appropriately upon set instantiation and potentially adapting how intersections are evaluated when involving conditional statements or piecewise functions.",
