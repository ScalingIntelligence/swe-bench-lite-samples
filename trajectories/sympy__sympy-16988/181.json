This pertains specifically to the `Intersection` class in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file, as well as potentially any related functions in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`. Additionally, since the expected result involves `Piecewise`, related code in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` might also be relevant. It is also important to look into how `FiniteSet` is instantiated and handled in `sympy/sets/sets.py` as it deals directly with the elements within sets.",

This code is directly responsible for defining the behavior of the intersection operation on sets. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file contains the `Piecewise` class, which is the expected output format mentioned in the issue. These findings are highly relevant to addressing the issue of handling duplicates in intersection operations and formatting the output correctly.

Specifically, the issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that ordering should produce canonical processing. The context provided shows relevant code spans from `sympy/sets/sets.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which include the `Intersection` class and its methods, as well as the `Piecewise` class. The new search results provide additional code spans from `sympy/sets/sets.py`, including the `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method, which directly deals with handling finite sets in intersections. This method is crucial for addressing the issue of handling duplicates, as it processes sets to find common elements. The search results also include other relevant sections such as `Intersection.as_relational` and parts of the `FiniteSet` class, which are useful for understanding how sets are iterated over and compared. These findings align well with the reported issue and provide a foundation for further implementing the required changes.",

It would be beneficial to inspect closely the `_handle_finite_sets` method within the `Intersection` class for its role in processing finite sets and possibly de-duplicating elements. Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function, which is called during the instantiation of `Intersection`, should be examined for potential improvements in detecting and removing duplicates.\n\nFurther examination of related utility functions or methods in `sympy/sets/handlers/` could also provide insights into more effective de-duplication strategies. The instantiation and handling of `FiniteSet` in `sympy/sets/sets.py` should be revisited with a focus on how elements are added and managed within sets, potentially identifying additional points where duplicates could be eliminated.\n\nLastly, while examining the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant due to its anticipated use in handling intersection results, its direct role in de-duplication may be less critical than the set handling functions mentioned above.",

In 'sympy/sets/sets.py', the class Intersection and its methods are critical. The '__new__' method controls the instantiation of Intersection objects, influencing how duplicates are initially handled. The '_handle_finite_sets' method is also crucial as it processes finite sets within intersections, potentially where duplicates could be removed. The 'simplify_intersection' function is another key area, as it aims to simplify intersection operations, suggesting it may address duplicate removal.\n\n2. The 'sympy/sets/handlers/union.py' file does not directly address the intersection issue but provides context on how unions are handled, which indirectly impacts intersections as they can be part of union evaluations.\n\n3. The 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' file contains the 'intersection_sets' function, which is pivotal for handling how intersections between different types of sets are computed. This function could potentially be involved in the logic for removing duplicates, especially when dealing with intersections involving ConditionSet or specific types of sets like Naturals or Integers.\n\nTo ensure the intersection operation removes duplicates and evaluates correctly as per the reported issue, the identified code spans are likely to play key roles in implementing the functionality or verifying its presence.",

The `__new__` method of `Intersection` involves a filtering process and calls the `simplify_intersection` function, which in turn calls `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` for processing finite sets. Although the specific duplicate removal logic within `_handle_finite_sets` might need further attention, the structure is in place for further refinement. The discussion of `Piecewise` in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant for handling the results of intersections but less critical for the direct task of de-duplication in set operations. Overall, the provided code context seems sufficient to guide further development or improvement of the duplicate removal functionality for intersections.",
