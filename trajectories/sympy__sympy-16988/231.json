Specifically, the issue mentions that the intersection operation should handle duplicates properly, either by removing them or by ensuring that their presence does not affect the result. The provided example also shows that the intersection should either evaluate to a piecewise function or remain unevaluated based on the input sets. The search results contain key components such as the `Intersection` class, its `__new__` method, and the `simplify_intersection` function, which are directly relevant to the operation and simplification of intersections. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant as it represents piecewise functions, which are expected outcomes in the reported issue. These findings suggest that the current codebase already contains functionalities to handle intersections and piecewise functions, but adjustments might be needed to accommodate the handling of duplicates as specified in the issue.",
