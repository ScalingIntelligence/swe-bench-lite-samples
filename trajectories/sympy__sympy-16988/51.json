I identified two main files of relevance: 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py'. The 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file contains the Intersection class definition and the _handle_finite_sets method, which appears to be involved in processing arguments that are finite sets. The 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' file contains intersection handling for various set types, including ConditionSet, Naturals, Integers, and others. I found no direct reference to Piecewise in the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file, but there was a mention of 'wx' which could be a typo or misinterpretation. In contrast, the 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' file directly contains the definition and methods for the Piecewise class, including its constructor (__new__), evaluation (eval), and simplification (_eval_simplify) methods. All these components seem to be relevant for handling the Piecewise expression as mentioned in the issue. I will mark the relevant spans accordingly.",

In 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py', there are various dispatch functions for different types of sets but none that address the handling of duplicates in Intersection. 3. In 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py', the Piecewise class is present, which might be relevant for the desired output format, but it does not directly address the duplication issue in Intersection.

Additionally, the use of `Piecewise` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is considered, as the expected output includes a Piecewise function to handle different conditions resulting from the intersection. In the search results, the `Intersection` class and related methods in `sympy/sets/sets.py` are relevant, focusing on how intersections are computed and how duplicates might be managed. The `Piecewise` class and its methods are also reviewed, considering it is part of the expected outcome of the operation.

The issue provides examples of expected behavior and suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation. The file_context provides code spans from the sympy/sets/sets.py file, including the Intersection class and its _handle_finite_sets method, which manages the intersection of finite sets. The search_results include additional code spans from sympy/sets/sets.py that provide context on the simplify_intersection function and the _handle_finite_sets utility function, which are relevant to the handling of intersections. There are also code spans from sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py and sympy/sets/handlers/union.py that deal with intersections and unions of different types of sets. These additional code spans provide a more comprehensive view of how intersections are managed in the sympy library, which is relevant for addressing the reported issue.
