The expected behavior is described with examples showing that the intersection should either be empty or retain one instance of each element, depending on the value of 'x'. The suggestion is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and order them for canonical processing.\n\nReviewing the search results, I focused on code sections dealing directly with the Intersection class and its methods. The key spans that appear relevant are those defining the Intersection class itself, especially the methods like `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `as_relational`, which could be involved in how intersections are computed and simplified. These methods deal with the instantiation of Intersection objects, handling specific types of sets like FiniteSets, and converting intersections into relational expressions. The Piecewise class is also relevant, as it involves conditional logic which could be used to implement the desired behavior of returning different results based on conditions of intersection membership.\n\nBased on this analysis, I've identified the most relevant code spans which could be used to either resolve the issue or implement the new functionality that removes duplicates and evaluates intersections as described.",
