These methods deal with the intersection logic and can be inspected to ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation. Additionally, the <span id='Union'> and <span id='FiniteSet'> blocks are relevant as they deal with set operations and can impact the intersection behavior.

The Intersection class methods are detailed, including the `__new__`, `_contains`, and `_handle_finite_sets` methods, which are crucial for understanding how intersections are currently implemented and how duplicates might be handled. Additionally, the file includes methods for other set operations like union, complement, and symmetric difference, which may offer insight into broader set handling strategies. Given the comprehensive nature of the Intersection class within this context, it appears that all relevant code for addressing the issue is present. Further, the context indicates possible touchpoints with other set-related classes like Union and FiniteSet, suggesting a holistic view of set operations within SymPy.",
