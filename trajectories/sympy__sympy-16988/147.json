The key spans are related to the Intersection class, specifically the `__new__` method where the intersection is initialized and potentially evaluated. Additionally, the `_handle_finite_sets` method is crucial as it deals with intersections involving finite sets, which is directly related to the issue of duplicates and canonical ordering discussed. The FiniteSet class is also relevant as it represents sets that are potentially involved in intersections and need to handle duplicates. The simplify_intersection function is another critical part that further processes the intersection results, making it essential to ensure duplicates are managed properly here as well. Overall, these spans collectively handle the logic for intersection operations in the context of the reported issue.",
