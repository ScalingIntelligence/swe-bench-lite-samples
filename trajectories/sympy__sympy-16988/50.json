Analyzing the provided search results, I identified multiple code spans in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file that are relevant to the Intersection function. These include the `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `as_relational` methods, among others. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file contains relevant code in the `Piecewise` class, particularly in methods like `eval`, `_handle_irel`, `_eval_integral`, `_eval_interval`, and `_intervals`, which are related to handling piecewise functions and conditions. The `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` file contains a dispatch function for intersection_sets, though it doesn't seem directly relevant to the current issue as it deals more with general intersection handling rather than duplicate removal for this specific report. Based on this analysis, the relevant files and the most pertinent code spans are those in `sympy/sets/sets.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`.",

These methods deal with the creation and processing of intersection sets, which aligns with the issue's concerns. Although the precise handling of duplicates is not fully detailed in the provided snippet, the methods shown are likely to be involved in resolving the issue. Additionally, the `piecewise.py` file context provides a different perspective on another piece of the puzzle, but it is not directly related to the `Intersection` class issue being discussed here.
