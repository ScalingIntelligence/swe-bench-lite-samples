Additionally, `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` could be relevant for understanding how the result should be represented.",

The expected output should either be an unevaluated intersection or a Piecewise function that conditionally intersects based on whether the variable is equal to an element in the sets. The search results contain various spans of code related to the Intersection class and the Piecewise class. The most relevant parts are the __new__ method of Intersection, which handles the instantiation and evaluation of intersection operations, and the Piecewise class, which is used to represent conditional expressions. The __new__ method of Intersection includes logic for evaluating the intersection and ordering the arguments, which is likely where the logic for removing duplicates should be implemented or adjusted. The Piecewise class is important because it is mentioned in the expected output of the issue and is used to handle conditional expressions. The _handle_finite_sets method in the Intersection class is also relevant as it specifically deals with handling finite sets, which is directly related to the issue of removing duplicates. The Piecewise class, particularly the __new__ method, is important for understanding how conditional expressions are constructed and evaluated, as this might be necessary for implementing the behavior described in the issue.",
