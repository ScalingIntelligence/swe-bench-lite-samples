This suggests a need to review how intersections between different types of sets are handled, particularly those that might involve duplicates or need canonical representation. Additionally, there is a mention of the desired output being a `Piecewise` function, which implies checking the handling of such expressions in SymPy.\n\nGiven these points, the primary focus is on the `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` file where various dispatch methods for set intersection operations are defined. These methods cover intersections between different types of sets, including handling of `EmptySet`, `FiniteSet`, and other set types which can involve potential duplicates. Specifically, the focus is on methods like `intersection_sets(FiniteSet, FiniteSet)` which directly handles intersection of finite sets.\n\nAdditionally, reviewing the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file to understand the creation and evaluation of `Piecewise` functions is important to ensure that the output, possibly remapped as `Piecewise`, is handled correctly within SymPy's environment.\n\nThe issue prompts checking for a systematic approach to removing duplicates and ensuring the outputs are both canonical and functional within SymPy's symbolic mathematics.",

This suggests that the relevant code spans should be those that deal with Intersection functionality, particularly focusing on how duplicates are managed during the instantiation of sets. The current file context provided already contains some relevant files and spans, which include definitions and dispatch methods for intersection_sets. The search results provided expand on this by offering additional information on the Intersection class and its methods, along with related operations like simplify_intersection and union handling. This should offer a more comprehensive view of how intersections are managed and how duplicates can potentially be addressed. Specifically, the intersection_sets functions should be examined in detail as they directly relate to the operation of finding intersections between different sets. Additionally, the Intersection class implementation with its properties and methods will provide insights into how the Intersection object is itself structured and managed within the codebase. The simplify_intersection function is particularly interesting as it's responsible for simplifying intersections, potentially including the handling of duplicates in some form. Considering all these factors, the identified code spans should provide sufficient context and functionality to address the reported issue.",

This indicates that for FiniteSets, duplicates are automatically handled. However, for other types of sets, such as Intervals or Ranges, duplicates are not explicitly mentioned in the handling logic. This suggests that explicit handling of duplicates might be needed for these set types. Additionally, the Intersection class itself does not appear to have explicit duplicate handling during instantiation, as seen in sympy/sets/sets.py, where it is defined.

I've identified these relevant spans: 'intersection_sets_18' (handling of FiniteSet intersections), '_intlike_interval' (handling integer-like intervals), and 'Intersection.__new__' & 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' (both deal with intersection evaluation and simplification). Additionally, 'Set._complement' was inspected for how sets handle their complements, which might indirectly affect intersection logic when dealing with non-trivial set operations. Lastly, considering the Piecewise usage mentioned in the issue, 'Piecewise' & 'Piecewise.__new__' were also reviewed for any relevant intersection or duplicate handling logic.",

This function handles the intersection between different types of sets, including FiniteSets, Intervals, and Ranges, among others. In the case of FiniteSets, the intersection operation inherently removes duplicates through the use of set intersection, as seen in the line `return FiniteSet(*(a._elements & b._elements))`. This indicates that for FiniteSets, duplicates are automatically handled. However, for other types of sets, such as Intervals or Ranges, duplicates are not explicitly mentioned in the handling logic. This suggests that explicit handling of duplicates might be needed for these set types. Additionally, the Intersection class itself does not appear to have explicit duplicate handling during instantiation, as seen in sympy/sets/sets.py, where it is defined. The condition set implementation in sympy/sets/conditionset.py suggests that this module might interact with the Intersection class but does not focus on duplicate handling itself.",
