The `_handle_finite_sets` method in the `Intersection` class might be particularly relevant for handling the instantiation of intersections with duplicates. Additionally, the `intersection_sets` handlers in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` could be involved in the actual intersection operations.",

The `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method specifically deals with finite sets in an intersection, which is directly relevant to the issue of removing duplicates. Additionally, the `Intersection.__new__` method involves the instantiation of the Intersection class, indicating where the evaluation and ordering of sets might occur.

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
