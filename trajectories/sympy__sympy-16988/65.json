The provided search results include several key spans that are highly relevant to the issue: 'Set.intersect', 'Intersection.__new__', 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets', and 'simplify_intersection'. These spans contain methods that define the behavior of the Intersection class, including how intersections are evaluated, how finite sets are handled within intersections, and the simplification logic applied to intersections. By examining these spans, we can identify the specific areas of the codebase that need adjustment to ensure duplicates are appropriately managed within intersection operations. Additionally, the 'Intersection.as_relational' method might also be relevant for understanding how the intersection logic translates into relational expressions, which could indirectly relate to handling duplicates. Therefore, these spans are directly pertinent to the task of modifying the Intersection routine to address the issue of duplicate removal in intersection operations.",
