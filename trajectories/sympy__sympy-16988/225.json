The relevant files and methods to look into are Intersection class methods in sympy/sets/sets.py and the intersection_sets handlers in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py.

The initial analysis of the provided code spans shows that the Intersection class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' are particularly relevant. The Intersection class includes methods for handling the intersection of sets, potentially including duplicates, which aligns with the issue's requirement to remove duplicates. On the other hand, the Piecewise class is used for handling conditional expressions and could be necessary for implementing the requested functionality where the result depends on certain conditions, such as whether duplicates are present. Further analysis reveals that the Intersection class already has methods for handling elements like `__new__` and `identity`, which suggests it might have built-in mechanisms for handling duplicates, potentially at the outset of instantiation, as guessed in the issue. Additionally, the Piecewise class includes methods for evaluating expressions based on conditions (`__new__`, `eval`), which aligns with the need to implement conditional processing for the intersection results depending on the presence of duplicates.",

The current context shows relevant code spans in `sympy/sets/sets.py` related to the `Intersection` class and its methods, such as `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and others. The search results in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` and `sympy/sets/sets.py` provide additional functions like `simplify_intersection` and the intersection handlers for various types of sets. These results confirm that the codebase already handles intersections but the focus now is on ensuring duplicates are removed and handled correctly.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that the intersection method works as expected, including handling of duplicates and ensuring canonical processing.

However, no explicit handling of duplicates is evident in the code segments provided. Additionally, the Piecewise class integration might be straightforward if the Intersection results can be formatted into conditional expressions as needed by Piecewise.
