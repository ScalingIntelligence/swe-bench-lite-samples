These methods perform the actual intersection operations and are thus directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, for the handling of Piecewise results, the Piecewise class and its methods as found in the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file are relevant as they implement the Piecewise functionality expected as output in the reported issue. This includes the '__new__' and 'eval' methods in the Piecewise class. The 'sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py' file contains a utility function '_minmax_as_Piecewise' that transforms min/max operations into Piecewise form, which indirectly relates to the issue but is less directly relevant as it does not involve the Intersection class directly.",
