Additionally, we should consider the Piecewise class as it is mentioned as a potential desired output format. The intersection_sets function in the handlers might also be relevant, especially if it's responsible for the intersection logic.",

The issue mentions that duplicates should be removed at the outset, which implies a need to modify the instantiation of the Intersection class to better handle duplicate elements. Additionally, the requirement for returning a Piecewise result based on conditions implies a need to understand and potentially modify the Piecewise class and its interactions with set logic.\n\nAfter examining the provided code, the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file contains the main logic for the Intersection class, including its instantiation and the handling of its arguments with the `__new__` method. This file also includes some properties and methods relevant to the intersection functionality, such as `._new_args_filter`, `simplify_intersection`, and methods like `_contains`, which could be relevant to addressing the issue of handling duplicates properly.\n\nThe `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file contains the Piecewise class, which is responsible for handling conditional expressions and might be where the desired output format is defined or modified. This class includes methods for evaluating and manipulating piecewise functions, such as `__new__`, `eval`, and `_eval_interval`, which are pertinent to understanding how conditions for intersections can be expressed in this format.\n\nLastly, the `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` contains dispatch logic for handling intersection sets, but it currently has a simple implementation that does not directly address the issue of duplicates but might influence how intersections are processed in a broader context.",

In the given context, 'Intersection' implementation includes several relevant methods such as 'identity', 'zero', '__new__', 'args', 'is_iterable', '_contains', '__iter__', '_handle_finite_sets', and 'as_relational'. These methods include logic for intersection operations, handling of finite sets, and containment checks, which are directly connected to the reported issue. The search results confirm the presence of this logic and include additional context such as 'Union' and 'FiniteSet' implementations, which, although not directly related, provide context for understanding set operations in the library. 'Piecewise' implementation in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py is also relevant, particularly the '__new__' and 'eval' methods, indicating how conditions and expressions are managed and evaluated in a piecewise manner, potentially relevant for implementing the desired functionality in 'Intersection'. Therefore, the current search results comprehensively cover the required functionality and context for addressing the issue.",
