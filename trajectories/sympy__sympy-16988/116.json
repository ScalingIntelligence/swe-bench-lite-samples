The expected behavior should involve handling duplicates appropriately, potentially removing them at the outset, and ensuring the result remains consistent whether duplicates are present or not. The provided code includes multiple spans that might be relevant to this issue. The `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` contains the definition and implementation of the `Intersection` function. Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function within the same file deals with simplifying the intersection of sets, which might involve handling duplicates. In `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`, there are various `intersection_sets` dispatches that handle different types of sets, but none directly address the issue of duplicates mentioned in the report. The `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` could also be relevant if the result of the intersection needs to be represented as a piecewise function, but this is not directly related to the handling of duplicates in the intersection operation.

The Intersection class also has methods like `__new__` and `__iter__` that hint at how intersections are computed and iterated over. The example in the issue directly relates to how duplicates in sets are handled during intersection calculations. This behavior is likely to be implemented in the `_handle_finite_sets` method as it directly deals with handling intersections of FiniteSets. Given the file context and the issue, it appears that although specific code to handle duplicates immediately after instantiation is not explicitly mentioned (as suggested by the issue to handle duplicates upfront), the overall logic and methods available in the Intersection class and its handling of FiniteSets are enough to deduce where such logic could be integrated or modified to handle duplicates.
