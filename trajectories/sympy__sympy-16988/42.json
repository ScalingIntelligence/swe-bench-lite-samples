Notable code spans include those defining the Intersection class and its methods (__new__, _handle_finite_sets, and as_relational), as well as the intersection handling in the simplify_intersection function. This code is highly relevant as it directly pertains to how intersection operations are defined, instantiated, and simplified within the SymPy library. The current search results provide a comprehensive view of the intersection logic, but it's important to verify if there are any additional parts of the codebase that might handle duplicate removal in set intersection specifically according to the reported issue.",
