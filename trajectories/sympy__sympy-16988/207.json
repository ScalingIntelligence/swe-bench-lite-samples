To address this, we need to inspect the __new__ method of the Intersection class and the helper method _handle_finite_sets. It's also important to check how intersections are handled across different types of sets in sympy.sets.handlers.intersection.py. We should ensure that duplicates are managed correctly and consider the Piecewise class in sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise.py as the desired output might involve conditional logic.",

Additionally, the `_handle_finite_sets` static method within the `Intersection` class is specifically designed to manage finite sets, potentially dealing with duplicates and simplifying intersections. The related `sympy.sets.handlers.intersection.py` file contains various dispatch functions that handle intersections between different types of sets, but it does not explicitly handle duplicates within intersections.

The `simplify_intersection` function also seems to be involved in this process, particularly when checking if the evaluate flag is set to True. Additionally, the `_handle_finite_sets` static method within the `Intersection` class is specifically designed to manage finite sets, potentially dealing with duplicates and simplifying intersections. The related `sympy.sets.handlers.intersection.py` file contains various dispatch functions that handle intersections between different types of sets, but it does not explicitly handle duplicates within intersections. Therefore, focusing on the `Intersection` class and its methods in `sympy/sets/sets.py` is crucial for addressing the issue of removing duplicates within intersections.",
