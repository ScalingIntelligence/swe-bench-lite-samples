The desired behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and ensure canonical processing. Given the context, the Intersection class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' is likely where the issue resides. Additionally, considering the expected output involves Piecewise, it's also relevant to look at the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py'. Furthermore, the routine may need to handle finite sets and their intersections, which suggests a focus on the FiniteSet class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py'. Lastly, the intersection handlers in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' and 'sympy/geometry/entity.py' might also be relevant for a more comprehensive understanding.",

Users expect the function to handle duplicates appropriately, potentially by removing them at the outset of instantiation or by ensuring canonical processing. The key elements of the issue are: 1. The `Intersection` function not handling duplicates correctly. 2. The desire for the result to mimic `Piecewise` behavior, specifically returning a `Piecewise` object with conditions and results. The provided search results focus on two main files: `sympy/sets/sets.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. In `sympy/sets/sets.py`, the `Intersection` class and its methods are defined, including how it processes arguments and handles finite sets. In `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, the `Piecewise` class and its methods are defined, which could provide the desired output format. Given the issue's complexity, focusing on `Intersection`'s handling of arguments and how it interacts with `FiniteSet` would be crucial. Additionally, understanding how to incorporate `Piecewise` into the `Intersection`'s output based on conditions would be necessary.",

The expected output involving Piecewise also aligns with the provided file context, as the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' includes methods like '_eval_interval' that are critical for handling conditional expressions as required by the issue. This context is sufficient to identify changes needed to remove duplicates and handle conditional expressions appropriately during intersections.
