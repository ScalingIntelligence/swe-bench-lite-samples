The provided code spans from the search results include the definition of the Intersection class and its __new__ method, which is responsible for instantiation and evaluation of intersection operations. Also included is the _handle_finite_sets static method, which specifically deals with intersections involving finite sets and could be a key part of handling duplicates since finite sets are directly iterable and can easily have duplicates removed. Furthermore, the simplify_intersection function is present, which is used to simplify sets before they are processed by the Intersection class. Since duplicates in set intersections are the focus of the issue, the relevant code spans include those that instantiate and handle intersections directly (Intersection.__new__ and _handle_finite_sets) and those that preprocess sets to simplify and potentially remove duplicates (simplify_intersection).",
