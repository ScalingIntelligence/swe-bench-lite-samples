The current implementation might not properly handle duplicates, leading to incorrect results. To address this, the focus should be on the __new__ method of the Intersection class in the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file, specifically looking into the _handle_finite_sets static method which might be responsible for the initial handling of the sets. Additionally, examining the intersection_sets function in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' will provide insight into how intersections are processed between different types of sets. Also, checking the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' could help understand how conditional logic is implemented, which might be related to the expected output format.",

Additional relevant code spans are identified in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which contains the definition of the `Piecewise` class and its methods, which are crucial for expressing the desired conditions. The code spans identified from these files are closely related to the operations and conditions specified in the reported issue, indicating that the search task is likely complete.
