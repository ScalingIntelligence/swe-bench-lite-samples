Specifically, it notes that duplicates should be removed when instantiated and that ordering should ensure canonical processing. The provided search results contain several code spans relevant to this issue, including the Intersection class and its methods such as __new__, args, and _handle_finite_sets. Additionally, the Piecewise class and its methods are included, as the expected output involves a Piecewise function. The analysis of these spans reveals that the Intersection class handles the instantiation of new objects and evaluates arguments through the simplify_intersection function. This context suggests that modifications should be made to the simplify_intersection function or within the Intersection.__new__ method to manage duplicates effectively. The Piecewise class methods are also relevant for handling the output in the required format. Overall, the provided code spans offer a solid basis for addressing the reported issue, though additional details on how to specifically target duplicates within the simplify_intersection function or the Intersection.__new__ method are needed for a complete solution.",
