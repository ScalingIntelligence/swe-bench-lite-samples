The example provided suggests that the intersection of sets should correctly handle and remove duplicates, giving a canonical result. The current search results include relevant code spans within the sympy/sets/sets.py file, particularly the Intersection class and its methods __new__ and _handle_finite_sets, which are directly involved in the computation of intersections. These code spans provide the necessary context to understand how the Intersection class is implemented and how it might be modified to address the issue of handling duplicates. Additionally, the search results include the FiniteSet class, which is relevant as the intersection operation works with finite sets. The simplify_intersection function is also included as it likely plays a role in simplifying intersections, which might involve handling duplicates. The sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py file includes the Piecewise class, which is relevant for understanding how the example provided might be converted into piecewise conditions, but is secondary to the primary concern of handling intersections in sympy/sets/sets.py. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of the classes and methods involved in intersection operations within the sympy codebase, giving a complete understanding necessary for addressing the reported issue.",
