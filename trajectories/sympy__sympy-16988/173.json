It would be beneficial to investigate the Intersection class and the methods related to its instantiation and evaluation, specifically focusing on the __new__ method and the _handle_finite_sets static method, which might handle the construction of the Intersection objects and manage the sets being intersected. Additionally, examining the intersection_sets function in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py might also provide insights into how intersections are processed, including handling of duplicates. Also, looking into the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py will help understand how conditional results are managed.",

The provided search results contain relevant code spans from three different files: 'sympy/sets/sets.py', 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py', and 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py'. In 'sympy/sets/sets.py', the 'Intersection' class and its methods are defined, including '__new__', 'identity', and 'args'. These methods are crucial for understanding how the Intersection class works and how it might handle duplicates. In 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py', there are multiple 'dispatch' methods for handling different types of sets in intersections. This file is relevant because it shows how different set types are processed during an intersection operation. Lastly, 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' defines the 'Piecewise' class, which is essential for implementing the required behavior described in the reported issue, particularly the need for a Piecewise result when certain conditions are met. Given these findings, it appears that the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue, encompassing the Intersection class, its methods, and the Piecewise class required for the desired output.",
