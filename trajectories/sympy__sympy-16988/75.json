Specifically, the Intersection should either remove duplicates or remain unevaluated and return a Piecewise result. Given the context, the relevant code spans are likely found within the Intersection class definition and related handlers for intersection operations. Additionally, the Piecewise class definition may play a role in how the result is structured. Hence, I will focus the search on these specific areas.",

The provided search results contain relevant code spans in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file that define the Intersection class and its methods, including `__new__`, `__iter__`, and `_handle_finite_sets`, which are likely involved in the intersection operations. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file contains the Piecewise class, which is mentioned in the expected output and could be relevant for constructing the result. The `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` file has a dispatch function for intersection operations but did not reveal additional relevant spans. Based on the issue, the identified spans in the Intersection class are crucial as they manage how intersections are computed and possibly how duplicates are removed or handled. The Piecewise class is also relevant as it is used to construct conditional results, as required by the issue. The current search results are sufficient to address the reported issue, particularly focusing on the '__new__' and '_handle_finite_sets' methods within the Intersection class and the Piecewise class for conditional logic.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
