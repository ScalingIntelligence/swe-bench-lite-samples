The Intersection class is responsible for handling set intersections, which is directly related to the issue of removing duplicates. The reported issue involves the behavior of the Intersection function when encountering duplicate elements. The Piecewise class is relevant because the expected output involves a Piecewise function, which should handle conditional expressions. By analyzing the provided code spans, we can identify relevant parts such as the Intersection.__new__ method, which controls the instantiation behavior of the Intersection class, and the _handle_finite_sets static method, which specifically deals with finite sets. For the Piecewise class, the eval and __new__ methods are crucial, as they handle the evaluation and instantiation of Piecewise expressions, which is essential for formatting the expected output according to the reported issue. These methods provide a basis for understanding how to modify or extend the functionality to address the issue with removing duplicates and incorporating conditional expressions.",
