The desired behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and potentially return a Piecewise result or remain unevaluated based on conditions. The relevant files and functions seem to be primarily in the sympy/sets/sets.py file, specifically the Intersection class. Other relevant modules include sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py for detailed intersection handling logic and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py for understanding how Piecewise functionality works. It's also worth checking sympy/solvers/solveset.py for any set-related solving mechanisms that might influence intersection handling. Since the main issue is within the Intersection class, focusing on that and related files should be sufficient.",

The expected outcome should be a Piecewise function handling whether the variable (x) is equal to 1 or not. The current implementation needs to be checked for the handling of duplicates, and the intersection should be checked against the Piecewise function behavior expectation.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the following key information was found:\n1. The `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` is defined along with its `__new__` method.\n2. The `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method specifically handles finite sets in intersections, which might be relevant for handling duplicates.\n3. The `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant for representing the expected output, especially with methods like `Piecewise.eval` and `Piecewise._eval_interval` which can help in achieving the Piecewise function behavior as per the issue requirement.\n\nFrom the search results, it seems that the relevant code spans exist within the Intersection class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` and the Piecewise class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`.",
