The simplify_intersection function is crucial as it orchestrates the simplification process of intersections, including handling of duplicates and returning the appropriate result based on the presence of EmptySet. Lastly, the intersection_sets function from sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py indicates that there are specific handlers for different types of set intersections, which may need to be reviewed or extended to handle cases with duplicates more effectively.",

The codebase analysis reveals multiple sections relevant to intersections, including methods within the `Intersection` class and utility functions related to intersections. The provided search results reaffirm the relevance of these sections, particularly focusing on the `Intersection` class and the `simplify_intersection` function which could be central to addressing the issue. Additionally, the `_handle_finite_sets` method in the new search results may also be relevant as it deals with handling finite sets during set operations.
