Additionally, there are code spans related to the Piecewise class, which may be relevant for implementing the desired behavior as described in the issue. The analysis of the code spans reveals that the Intersection class has methods for handling finite sets, evaluating intersections, and iterating through sets, which directly pertain to the requirements of the issue. The Piecewise class methods may be useful for implementing the output in the format specified in the issue. Based on this analysis, the identified spans are considered relevant to address the issue.",
