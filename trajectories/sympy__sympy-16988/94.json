However, the issue suggests that the intersection results should be in the form of 'Piecewise' based on the equality of 'x'. This implies that while 'Piecewise' isn't directly used in the sympy.sets.sets module, it is a critical component for the expected output format of intersections.

The reported issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that ordering them will produce canonical processing. We start by examining the code spans in sympy/sets/sets.py which handle intersections. Notably, the Intersection class, its __new__ method, and the _handle_finite_sets static method are relevant as they deal with the instantiation and processing of intersections involving FiniteSets. We also need to consider the routine for intersect in the Set class. The Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py might also be relevant as it helps in handling conditional returns, and since the reported issue mentions the expectation to return 'Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))', understanding Piecewise is crucial. Finally, we see that there are various printers (like C89CodePrinter, GLSLPrinter, etc.) handling Piecewise, which might indirectly relate to the issue though not directly relevant to fixing the reported issue.",
