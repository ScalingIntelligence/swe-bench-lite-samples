The provided search results include several relevant code spans that can help address the issue:\n\n1. The 'Intersection' class defines the behavior of intersection operations. This is the primary class of interest.\n2. The '__new__' method of the 'Intersection' class is responsible for creating a new instance of Intersection. It includes logic for evaluating the intersection when 'evaluate' is True, which involves a call to 'simplify_intersection'.\n3. The '_handle_finite_sets' static method within the 'Intersection' class deals specifically with finite sets. This method iterates through elements of finite sets, checking for containment in other sets and handling symbolic elements. This method is crucial for addressing the issue of duplicates since it processes elements directly.\n4. The 'simplify_intersection' function is also relevant as it is called when evaluating intersections to simplify the result.\n\nThese code spans collectively cover the instantiation, handling of finite sets, and simplification of intersection operations, all of which are critical for addressing the reported issue regarding duplicates and correct intersection evaluations. By examining these parts of the code, we can identify where the handling of duplicates might need adjustments to meet the desired behavior described in the issue.",
