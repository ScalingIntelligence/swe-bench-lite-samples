The desired behavior is for the Intersection function to either evaluate the intersection correctly by removing duplicates, or to remain unevaluated if the handling of duplicates is not straightforward. The provided search results contain several key sections that are directly relevant to this issue. In 'sympy/sets/sets.py', there are multiple code spans related to the Intersection class and its methods, such as '__new__' and 'simplify_intersection', which are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of the intersection operation. These sections show how the intersection operation is initialized and evaluated, which is directly related to the reported issue of managing duplicates. Additionally, the use of 'simplify_intersection' function indicates that simplification is intended, which aligns with the expectation of removing duplicates. The 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' file, though not directly related to the set operations, contains the Piecewise class which is relevant in the context of evaluating a conditionally defined expression. The Piecewise class could potentially be used to implement the desired behavior as described in the reported issue, where the result should be 'Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))'. Therefore, both files and their respective code spans are considered relevant to address the reported issue.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
