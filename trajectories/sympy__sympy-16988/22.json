These methods are responsible for the core logic of how intersections are calculated, including handling of FiniteSets. Additionally, the simplify_intersection function is relevant as it is used within the Intersection class's __new__ method to simplify the intersection results. The handlers for intersection in the intersection.py file are also crucial, as they define how different types of sets intersect with each other.
