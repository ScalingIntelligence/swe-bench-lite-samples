The expected behavior is to either remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation or to return a Piecewise expression based on the equality of elements. The search results contain several relevant code spans, particularly in the Intersection class and its methods (like __new__, _handle_finite_sets, and as_relational) within sympy/sets/sets.py, which handle the intersection logic. Additionally, sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py contains definitions for the Piecewise class, which is expected to be the output for certain intersection scenarios. These spans indicate where the intersection logic is defined and how it might interact with Piecewise expressions, aligning well with the reported issue. The analysis of the code suggests that modifications in the Intersection class (specifically in __new__ and _handle_finite_sets methods) along with understanding how to use or modify the Piecewise class within the intersection results could address the issue. Therefore, these identified spans are relevant to the reported issue, and the search task can be considered complete based on these findings.",
