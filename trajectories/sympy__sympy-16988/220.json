The expected output should either be a Piecewise expression or remain unevaluated when duplicates are present. To address this, the Intersection class's __new__ method and _handle_finite_sets static method need to be examined for potential modifications, specifically focusing on the removal of duplicates at the outset of instantiation and ensuring canonical processing. Additionally, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py should be checked to ensure it correctly encapsulates the intersection results in the expected manner.",

The expected behavior is described with specific examples, and clarifications are given regarding the removal of duplicates and canonical processing of sets. The search results contain several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file, where the Intersection class is defined. This class includes methods like __new__, args, is_iterable, and as_relational, which are directly related to the behavior of intersections. Additionally, the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' is relevant for handling conditional expressions, which is closely related to the expected output format described in the issue. The search results also include other supporting methods and classes like FiniteSet, which is used in handling finite sets within intersections. All these sections of code are directly or indirectly related to the functionality required to address the issue. Therefore, these sections are identified as relevant code spans to investigate further and potentially modify to ensure the described behavior is implemented correctly.",
