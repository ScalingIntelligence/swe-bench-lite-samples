The `Intersection.__new__` method and the `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method are particularly relevant as they deal with the instantiation and evaluation of intersection operations, including handling of finite sets. These methods will likely need to be adjusted to ensure duplicates are removed and the intersections are processed in a canonical manner.

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
