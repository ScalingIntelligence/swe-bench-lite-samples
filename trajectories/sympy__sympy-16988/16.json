The 'Intersection.__new__' span is crucial as it controls the instantiation of the Intersection object and whether it should be evaluated immediately. The 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' span is also relevant as it specifically deals with the intersection of finite sets, which might involve handling duplicates. The 'simplify_intersection' function is called within the '__new__' method and is responsible for simplifying the intersection arguments, which could involve removing duplicates. However, upon reviewing the entire code section, it does not explicitly handle duplicates. Thus, the provided code does not fully address the issue of removing duplicates in the intersection operation. Further investigation or modification of the code would be needed to implement the desired functionality.",
