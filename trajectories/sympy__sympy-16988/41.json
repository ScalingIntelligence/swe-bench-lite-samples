Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function is relevant as it simplifies the intersection of sets. The provided code also includes the definition of `FiniteSet`, which is likely involved in the intersection operations. Based on the analysis, these code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue, and further searching might not be necessary unless additional specific functionalities related to intersection operations are identified.",
