The relevant files from the context suggest that the Intersection class is defined in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and has a method '__new__' which likely handles the instantiation. Additionally, the 'simplify_intersection' function might also be involved in processing the intersection arguments. The 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' indicates a potential need to use piecewise functions to handle the different conditions specified in the issue. The '_handle_finite_sets' method within the Intersection class might specifically be crucial for handling sets in the intersection operation. Since the intersection logic is scattered across multiple files, it's important to search both the Intersection class and the intersection_sets function dispatch in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' for a comprehensive understanding and modification of the intersection logic.",

There's also a mention of simplify_intersection which could be relevant for canonicalizing the intersection results. The search results include intersection handling for specific sets like ConditionSet, Naturals, and Range, which might contribute to the overall intersection logic but do not directly address the issue of duplicates in the intersection results. The inclusion of these handlers, however, provides more context on how intersections are generally managed, which could influence the approach to handling duplicates. The Piecewise class from sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py is likely necessary for constructing the desired output, as it allows for conditional expressions. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those involved in defining the Intersection class, its methods for handling finite sets, and the Piecewise class's constructor for conditional logic creation.
