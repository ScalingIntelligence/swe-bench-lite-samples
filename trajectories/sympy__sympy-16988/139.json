The search should focus on the Intersection class and related methods in the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file. It is also important to identify where and how duplicates are handled, which might involve checking the '__new__' method and the '_handle_finite_sets' static method within the Intersection class. Additionally, as the solution should involve returning a Piecewise object, it might be beneficial to also look into the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' and how it interacts with set operations. The search should consider the method signatures and implementations of these classes to address the issue comprehensively.",

The reported issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that the routine should handle duplicates appropriately, potentially using a canonical ordering. The search results provide several key sections in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file related to the `Intersection` class. These include the `__new__` method, which controls the instantiation of the `Intersection` object, the `_handle_finite_sets` static method, which is likely involved in handling finite sets, and the `as_relational` method, which converts the intersection into a relational expression. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file contains the `Piecewise` class, which might be relevant for returning the result in a piecewise format as specified in the issue. These sections provide the necessary context to understand how intersections are formed and how they relate to the reported issue. The identified code spans will be crucial for implementing the desired functionality.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
