Additionally, I need to review code related to handling of finite sets within intersections, as the issue might be related to how these sets are processed for duplicates. The provided 'simplify_intersection' function is also a crucial part to examine since it likely orchestrates the simplification of intersection results, possibly including the removal of duplicates.",

Specifically, the static method '_handle_finite_sets' is designed to handle intersections involving finite sets, a key component for addressing duplicates. This method processes each element to determine if it should be included in the intersection based on set containment queries, potentially useful for ensuring duplicates are not retained in intersection operations. Furthermore, the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' is observed, which plays a critical role in handling conditional expressions, potentially essential for the compound conditional output required by the issue. Given this analysis, I believe the file context sufficiently includes key areas relevant to handling the reported issue on intersection set operations with conditions for retaining or removing duplicates and structured conditional output.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
