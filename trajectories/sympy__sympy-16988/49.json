The issue suggests handling duplicates by removing them at the outset of instantiation and ordering them for canonical processing. This implies potential modifications in the Intersection class's __new__ method to preprocess arguments and ensure duplicates are removed. Additionally, the issue mentions using Piecewise to handle conditional results, which implies interacting with the Piecewise class and its methods. The provided code context does not yet include the relevant code spans, so we need to analyze the search results aiming to find critical methods like __new__ in Intersection and the core functionality in Piecewise.

This involves looking at how intersections are handled and potentially modifying the routine to ensure duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation. Based on the current file context, the relevant parts of the code include the Intersection class, specifically the __new__ method where the intersection is instantiated, and the _handle_finite_sets method which deals with finite sets. Additionally, the simplify_intersection function is crucial as it processes the intersection arguments. In the new search results, the Intersection class and its methods are again present, confirming their relevance. Thus, these segments continue to be central to addressing the issue. Furthermore, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py appears relevant as it might be used to handle the conditional logic required to address the issue as suggested in the reported issue. The new search results confirm the presence of the Intersection class methods, providing additional context for analysis. Therefore, the Identified Spans should include these relevant segments of code for further inspection and potential modification.",
