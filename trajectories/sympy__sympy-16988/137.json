I analyzed the provided search results from two files: 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py'. In 'sympy/sets/sets.py', the 'Intersection' class definition and its '__new__' method were identified as relevant, as they deal with the intersection computation logic including evaluation control and argument processing. The '_handle_finite_sets' method within 'Intersection' is responsible for handling the intersection of finite sets, which involves checking each element's membership and this could be a key part for addressing the duplicate element in intersection issue. Additionally, 'FiniteSet' and 'simplify_intersection' methods were analyzed as they are closely related to handling sets and optimizing intersections. In 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py', several 'intersection_sets' functions were identified, which handle intersection operations for different types of sets. Specifically, functions handling intersections involving 'FiniteSet', 'Range', 'Interval', 'Naturals', and 'Integers' were relevant due to their direct connection with processing the intersection logic for these types of sets. This analysis suggests that modifications or enhancements to the 'Intersection' class and related helper functions will likely be necessary to address the reported issue related to duplicate elements in intersections.",
