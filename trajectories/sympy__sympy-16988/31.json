This needs to be fixed to ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation to produce canonical results. I have already identified some relevant files based on the set operations and classes involved. To specifically address the issue, I will focus on the Intersection class in sympy/sets/sets.py, which seems to be the core class handling intersections. Additionally, the simplify_intersection function within the same file may also be relevant. For validation of the expected output, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py should be considered to ensure the correct conditional logic can be produced.",

The Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py is also relevant as it will be used to represent the result in a piecewise manner as described in the issue.

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
