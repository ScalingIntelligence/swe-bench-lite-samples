The expectation is that duplicates should be removed upon instantiation, leading to canonical processing. Relevant files include sympy/sets/sets.py, which contains the Intersection class definition and methods like __new__ and _handle_finite_sets. Additionally, sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py contains intersection handling for various set types using the @dispatch decorator. Code related to Piecewise functions, which are expected in the solution, is found in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py. To address the issue, focus on these files and methods to ensure duplicates are managed appropriately during intersection computation.",

Additionally, the sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py file contains dispatch functions for handling intersections with different types of sets, which also provides insight into how intersections are managed across various set types. The sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py file contains the Piecewise class, which is directly related to the expected output format mentioned in the issue.
