The code analysis should focus on the Intersection class and related methods to identify how duplicates are handled or should be handled. In the context provided, the Intersection class methods __new__, _handle_finite_sets, and as_relational are crucial for understanding the intersection behavior. The search results confirm the presence of these methods in the Intersection class, and further, the _handle_finite_sets method specifically deals with finite sets within intersections, making it relevant for potential duplicate handling. The detailed review of these methods suggests they are directly related to the issue and should be considered in any solution or further investigation. The search task is complete as the relevant methods for addressing the issue have been identified.",

Given this, it appears that the file context does contain the relevant code areas needed to address the issue of removing duplicates in intersections. The `_handle_finite_sets` method directly involves processing finite sets, which is exactly where duplicates would need to be managed according to the issue description.
