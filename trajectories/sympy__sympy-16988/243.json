Reviewed the existing Intersection class in sympy/sets/sets.py to identify methods and properties that could be relevant for handling duplicates. Specifically examined the __new__ method and the _new_args_filter property to understand how the arguments are processed and potentially filtered. \n3. Examined the intersection handling functions in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py to understand how intersections are currently computed and if they handle duplicates. \n4. Reviewed the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py to understand how conditional logic is handled, as suggested in the reported issue.
