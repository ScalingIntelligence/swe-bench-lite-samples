The relevant files and classes identified include `Intersection` in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, `ConditionSet` and `intersection_sets` handlers in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`, and `Piecewise` in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. To address the issue of duplicates, the focus should be on methods related to instantiation and handling of arguments in the Intersection class, as well as any related utility functions like `simplify_intersection`. Given the context, searching within `sets.py`, `handlers/intersection.py`, and potentially `piecewise.py` for methods involving handling of arguments and intersection logic would be beneficial.",

The initial search results provide several code spans from sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, which are potential candidates for the necessary modifications or bug fixes.\n\nIn sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py, the various spans of code handle specific types of set intersections, such as handling two ConditionSets or intersections between different specific sets. These handlers might require adjustments or additional logic to correctly manage and remove duplicates as per the issue's requirement.\n\nIn sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, the spans of code related to the Piecewise class and its methods are crucial as the expected output format involves Piecewise expressions. The __new__, eval, and _eval_interval methods within the Piecewise class are particularly interesting as they handle the construction, evaluation, and interval-based evaluation of Piecewise expressions, which are directly relevant to the expected output format in the issue.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the initial set of identified code spans seems relevant to address the problem as they cover both the intersection handling and the Piecewise expression formatting aspects. Further analysis and potentially more granular code span identification might be necessary to pinpoint exactly where adjustments are needed to meet the reported issue's requirements.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
