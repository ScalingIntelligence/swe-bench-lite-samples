The expected result for the given example should be 'Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))' or remain unevaluated if duplicates are present. 2. Review Current Context: The current file context includes definitions of `Set`, `FiniteSet`, `Intersection`, and related operations in 'sympy/sets/sets.py'. Relevant spans include `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` which deals with handling finite sets during intersection operations. 3. Process New Search Results: The new search results include additional relevant sections in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' such as `Intersection.__new__`, `Intersection.args`, etc., and in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' with the definition of `Piecewise`. These results are indicative of the operations and logic used in handling intersections and defining piecewise functions, which are critical for resolving the issue. I will identify the specific spans in these files that are most relevant to addressing the reported issue concerning handling duplicates and canonical processing in intersections.",

The `__new__` method of the Intersection class calls `cls._new_args_filter(args)` which presumably filters arguments, potentially handling duplicates. Additionally, the `_handle_finite_sets` static method is reviewed for its role in processing finite sets during intersection, suggesting a likely place for duplicate handling. Also, the use of the Piecewise class within Intersection methods is examined for potential solutions to handle duplicates effectively. It appears that the Intersection class and its methods are well-equipped to handle intersections, including the possibility of removing duplicates. The `_handle_finite_sets` method is particularly relevant as it processes finite sets and could be adapted to remove duplicates. Therefore, based on the provided file context, it seems that all relevant code spans have been identified to determine how duplicates might be handled in the Intersection class.",
