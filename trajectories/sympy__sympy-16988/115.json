Specifically, it requested that duplicates should be removed at the outset and that Piecewise functions should be returned when necessary.\n\n1. Analyzing the import statements, I observe the use of `Piecewise` and `Intersection` from different modules, which aligns with the need to cross-reference different functionalities.\n\n2. The `Piecewise` class and its associated methods (`__new__` and `eval`) implement conditional logic to handle expressions based on conditions, enabling various expressions to be defined and evaluated conditionally. This is closely related to the desired functionality as the answer should be a `Piecewise` function or remain unevaluated.\n\n3. The `Intersection` class in `sets.py` is defined with methods handling the creation (`__new__`) and specific handling of finite sets (via `_handle_finite_sets`), which directly addresses the task of handling intersections, especially with regard to removing duplicates.\n\n4. The `simplify_intersection` function, also located in `sets.py`, centralizes the simplification logic across multiple types of sets when building the intersection. This could include strategies to avoid duplicates and to structure output as requested.\n\nOverall, the code spans referenced provide a comprehensive insight into handling intersections of sets and conditional expressions, suitable for implementing the reported issue resolution.",
