The desired behavior is to remove duplicates and possibly order the sets to ensure canonical processing. The relevant file seems to be sympy/sets/sets.py, where the Intersection class is defined. Additionally, the handling of intersections is likely in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py. We should focus on these files to identify how duplicates are currently handled and modify the logic accordingly.",

Key points to focus on would be the `Intersection` class methods, particularly those related to handling and evaluating intersections. \n\nFrom the provided search results, the file `sympy/sets/sets.py` contains the `Intersection` class which defines the functionality for set intersections. Relevant parts include `Intersection.__new__`, which constructs new `Intersection` objects and evaluates them, `Intersection._handle_finite_sets`, which deals with finite sets during intersection computation, and `Intersection._contains`, which determines the containment of elements in the intersection. These sections are likely places to adjust or extend to address the issue of duplicate elements in intersections.\n\nComplementarily, the file `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` contains specialized functions (`intersection_sets`) for different types of sets, such as `ConditionSet`, `Naturals`, `Integers`, and `Interval`. Although these functions are primarily for handling intersections between specific types of sets, understanding their logic can provide context and hints on where to address the duplicate handling within the `Intersection` class itself.\n\nOverall, the provided search results are relevant to the reported issue. However, further action would involve modifying the `Intersection` class methods seen above, possibly including additional logic to detect and handle duplicates explicitly as described in the issue. The existing methods provide a strong foundation to build from in order to implement the desired behavior.",

The file context provided includes sympy/sets/sets.py, which contains the Intersection class definition and its methods. Additionally, there's also sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py that handles specific intersection cases. From the code provided, it appears that duplicates are not explicitly addressed in the Intersection class, suggesting that this functionality might need to be added. The presence of other set operations and their handling suggests a robust framework for extending the functionality to include duplicate removal and ordering for canonical processing. It seems that the relevant code exists but needs further development to address the duplicate issue. Given the thorough examination of the provided file context, it is apparent that the Intersection class and its associated methods are in place, but the specific handling of duplicates and ordering as mentioned in the issue is not directly addressed in the provided code.

These spans deal directly with how intersections are calculated and simplified, which is central to addressing the issue.

The simplify_intersection function also plays a role in how intersections are processed, so it should be reviewed to ensure it respects the new logic for removing duplicates. The __new__ method of the Intersection class should be examined to understand how intersections are instantiated and consider integrating a new helper method for handling duplicates and ordering if necessary. The _handle_finite_sets method within the Intersection class is a good starting point for implementing the removal of duplicates and ensuring ordered sets, as it explicitly deals with intersection scenarios involving FiniteSets.",
