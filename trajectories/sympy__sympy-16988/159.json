The example provided shows that duplicates are not being removed correctly, leading to unexpected results. To address this, we need to focus on the Intersection class and its methods, particularly the __new__ method where instantiation logic is likely defined. Additionally, we should look into the _handle_finite_sets method as it might be involved in processing sets of arguments for intersection. It's also useful to inspect the simplify_intersection function, which might be responsible for simplifying intersections including handling of duplicates. Lastly, review the intersection_sets handler specifically designed for handling intersection operations between different types of sets.",

The key logical steps are as follows: \n1. **Instantiation with `__new__`**: During the creation of a new `Intersection` object, the `__new__` method filters arguments and normally calls `simplify_intersection` to process the intersection. \n2. **Simplification with `simplify_intersection`**: This function simplifies the intersection by handling special cases like intersections with `EmptySet` and by delegating to `intersection_sets`. \n3. **Handling Finite Sets with `_handle_finite_sets`**: In cases where there are `FiniteSet` arguments, this method sorts sets, applies elements one by one to check inclusion in all sets and handles possible scenarios for symbolic and non-symbolic elements specifically. \n4. **Specific Intersection Operations with `intersection_sets`**: This handles actual logical operations between different types of sets (e.g., intervals, ranges, etc.), which might involve checking overlaps based on set properties and element inclusion to produce precise intersections. \nFrom the provided context, the logical pathways and interactions between these components appear robust for processing intersections. However, the absence or presence of duplicates during set operations like intersections seems to be implicitly handled (or even skimmed over) across the whole transaction due to filtering mechanisms in both argument processing and set operation routines. Specifically, duplicates are not directly addressed or mutated in methods managing set intersections. Further areas for review may include: \n - Additional logics dedicated to filtering duplicates among set arguments before intersection processing. \n - Validation whether components potentially responsible for managing duplicates stricter in scope are functioning as expected (though absent in the provided context). \n - Customization of intersection routines at a subclass or method level might also bear clues to how comparably unique challenges are approached.",

Further areas for review may include: \n - Additional logics dedicated to filtering duplicates among set arguments before intersection processing. \n - Validation whether components potentially responsible for managing duplicates stricter in scope are functioning as expected (though absent in the provided context). \n - Customization of intersection routines at a subclass or method level might also bear clues to how comparably unique challenges are approached."

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
