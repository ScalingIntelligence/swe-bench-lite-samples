The example provided demonstrates that the current implementation of `Intersection` does not correctly handle duplicates, resulting in an incorrect evaluation. The desired behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset and order them for canonical processing. The search results include relevant code spans within `sympy/sets/sets.py` that handle the intersection of sets, including the `Intersection` class and its instantiation process, as well as methods for handling finite sets within intersections. Additionally, there are relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` that handle `Piecewise` expressions, which might be used in the desired output. These spans are directly relevant to the issue at hand as they deal with the logic and handling of sets and conditional expressions, which are central to resolving the reported issue.",
