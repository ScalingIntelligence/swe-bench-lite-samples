The analysis of the search results reveals that the most relevant code spans are within the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file. Specifically, the spans related to the Intersection class, its initialization (__new__ method), and the handling of finite sets (_handle_finite_sets method) are critical for addressing the issue. Additionally, the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' might be relevant for representing conditional outputs. The goal is to ensure that any duplicates in the input sets to Intersection are removed, and the result is either a Piecewise object representing the conditions or remains unevaluated if conditions are not fully met. The current implementations do not explicitly handle duplicates, and thus modifications are likely needed in the _new_args_filter or similar methods within the Intersection class.",
