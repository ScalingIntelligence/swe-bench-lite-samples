It requires ensuring that duplicates are removed and that the intersection behaves correctly when duplicates are present. It also suggests that the result should be a Piecewise function or remain unevaluated if the conditions warrant it. Given this, I will analyze the provided code spans to identify the relevant parts that deal with the Intersection logic and how duplicates might be handled. The Intersection class is central to this, particularly the __new__ method which handles the creation of new Intersection objects and the simplify_intersection function which simplifies the intersection of sets. The Piecewise class is also relevant as it might be used to represent the outcome of the intersection operations. Specifically, the Intersection.__new__ method and the simplify_intersection function seem most pertinent, as they deal directly with the logic of intersections and simplification of arguments.",

The desired behavior is to remove duplicates and possibly return a `Piecewise` result if the intersection involves a variable that might not be comparable at instantiation. From the provided context and search results, it's clear that the `Intersection` class and related methods handle the intersection logic. The `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` static method specifically deals with handling finite sets during intersection, which is crucial for managing duplicates. Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function can be relevant for further simplifying the intersection results, potentially removing duplicates in the process. The `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is likely where the final `Piecewise` result would be constructed if needed based on the conditions derived from the intersection operation.",

The analysis of the file context shows relevant methods and properties in the Intersection class, such as '__new__', '__iter__', and 'reduce', which handle the creation, iteration, and simplification of intersections. The '_handle_finite_sets' method specifically focuses on managing finite sets. Since these methods are present and directly concerned with intersection handling, it suggests that the file context is relevant for addressing the issue. However, it's noted that the exact implementation for removing duplicates within the intersection operations is not explicitly detailed in the provided code.
