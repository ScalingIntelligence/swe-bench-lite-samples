The issue prompts modifications to ensure that duplicates are removed at the instantiation stage, and that the intersection operations respect this canonical form. The provided search results contain relevant sections of code from two files, 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py', which define the 'Intersection' class and its handling of set operations, including the '_handle_finite_sets' method that processes finite sets and potentially deals with duplicates. Additionally, in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py', there are sections defining the 'Piecewise' class, which is mentioned in the issue's expected output format. The 'Intersection.__new__' and 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' methods are particularly relevant as they directly relate to the instantiation of intersection objects and the processing of finite sets, potentially involving the removal of duplicates. Furthermore, the 'Piecewise' class sections might be needed to handle the expected output format involving 'Piecewise' expressions. These sections may not directly address the duplicate removal at instantiation, but they are crucial for constructing the final output as specified in the issue.",

The file 'sympy/sets/sets.py' contains the Intersection class definition and the methods responsible for handling intersections, including '_handle_finite_sets' which specifically deals with intersections involving FiniteSets. The 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' file contains various dispatch methods for handling intersections between different types of sets. The focus should be on refining the handling of duplicates within these methods, possibly by implementing a mechanism for deduplication at the outset, as suggested in the issue. Additionally, understanding the interaction with Piecewise functions in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' is essential to ensure the desired behavior is achieved. Adjustments may need to be made to ensure that intersections correctly evaluate to the described Piecewise form when duplicates are present.",
