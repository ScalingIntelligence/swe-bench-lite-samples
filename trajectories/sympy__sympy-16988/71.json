The provided files suggest that the Intersection class and its methods are spread across multiple files, indicating a need to focus on these specific files for further investigation. Considering the provided context, the `__new__` method in `Intersection` class and the `_handle_finite_sets` static method seem to be critical for managing the intersection logic. Additionally, the `Intersection` class interacts with other set classes like `Piecewise` and `FiniteSet`, which need to be examined for proper handling of duplicates. Given these insights, the search should focus on the `Intersection` class methods and related set operations.",

The issue suggests that the Intersection routine should handle duplicates by removing them at the outset.

The search results show relevant code spans in sympy/sets/sets.py, sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py, and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py. Specifically, the Intersection class and its methods are relevant, as they handle the logic for intersections. Additionally, the Piecewise class and its methods are relevant for constructing the expected output.

Analyzed the reported issue which discussed the need for the `Intersection` function to remove duplicates and handle multiple sets correctly, returning results in a canonical form using `Piecewise`. 2. Examined the existing code to understand the implementation of `Intersection`, focusing on `Intersection.__new__` and `Intersection._new_args_filter` which are critical for handling arguments and potential duplicates. 3. Reviewed the new search results, primarily focusing on the `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method which is likely used for handling finite sets where duplicates can occur. 4. Noted that `Piecewise` class and related methods were already in the context, important for forming the results into piecewise function expressions as suggested in the issue. 5. Determined that the new relevant code spans include `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` which directly addresses the handling of finite sets, a crucial part of the issue's request for canonical processing and duplicate removal. 6. Confirmed the `intersection_sets` function in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` is also relevant as it handles intersection operations between different types of sets.",
