The expected behavior is to either return a Piecewise result based on the condition or remain unevaluated. The relevant classes and methods to investigate include Intersection, Piecewise, and any handling routines for set intersections. Additionally, the routine should ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset, suggesting focus on the __new__ method in the Intersection class and possibly the _handle_finite_sets static method. Given the file context, it is evident that the relevant files have been provided, so the search can focus on these with an emphasis on lines that handle duplicates and set intersections.",

The expectation is that duplicates should be removed, and the intersection should return a `Piecewise` result indicating whether the elements are in the intersection based on the conditions provided. The search results provided extensive code spans from the `sympy/sets/sets.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` files. Relevant spans include those defining the `Intersection` class, particularly the `__new__` method which handles evaluation and simplification of arguments, and the `_handle_finite_sets` method which manages the intersection of finite sets. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class from the `piecewise.py` file is crucial as it is the expected output format for the intersection results. The `__new__` method of `Piecewise` is particularly relevant for understanding how to construct a piecewise function based on conditions.",
