This implies that when computing the intersection of sets, duplicates should not appear in the result. The current context and search results provide relevant classes and methods in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, such as `Set`, `Intersection`, and `simplify_intersection`, which handle set operations including intersection. The issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset, which might involve a modification in how intersections are computed or simplified. Additionally, `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` specifically deals with finite sets, which could be a critical part to address the issue of duplicate removal. The provided search results also include `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`, which contains dispatch functions for handling different types of set intersections, potentially relevant for implementing or modifying intersection logic. Furthermore, the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` could be indirectly related if parts of the set operations are transformed into piecewise functions, as suggested by the desired output.",
