I analyzed the search results and identified several key areas that are relevant to this issue. The 'Intersection' span directly includes the class definition for Intersection. The 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' span contains static methods that handle how the Intersection operation processes finite sets, which is directly related to the issue of duplicates. The 'FiniteSet' span details the FiniteSet class, which is likely where the logic for handling duplicates within sets would be implemented. The 'simplify_intersection' function likely coordinates simplifying intersections, though it doesn't directly handle duplicates it's where you'd manage handling intersections across different types of sets. Given these findings, it's clear the identified spans contain relevant code to address the reported issue concerning duplicates in Intersection operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves handling duplicates in intersections of sets, and ensuring that the result remains unevaluated or follows a specific pattern if certain conditions are met. This requires modifications or enhancements to the `Intersection` class and related functions, particularly `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` and `simplify_intersection`. The search results provide relevant functions and methods that can be useful for modifying the behavior of intersections in SymPy, including the `Intersection` class itself, as well as utility functions like `simplify_intersection` that help in simplifying and evaluating intersections of sets.\n\nThe existing code in `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` and `simplify_intersection` can be used as a basis for modifying the behavior of intersections to meet the requirements mentioned in the issue. Specifically, `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` deals with handling finite sets during intersections, which is a crucial part of the functionality that needs to be adapted to remove duplicates properly. Additionally, `simplify_intersection` could be modified to ensure that intersections follow the desired pattern when specific conditions are met.\n\nThe analysis of the search results indicates that the provided code spans are relevant and sufficient for making the necessary modifications to address the issue. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete with the identification of the relevant code spans.",
