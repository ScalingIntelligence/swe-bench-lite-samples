This involves modifying the intersection operations to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation. Given the relevance of sets, intersecting, and handling duplicates, the primary focus should be on the Intersection class and its related methods in the sympy/sets/sets.py file. Additional attention should be given to the sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py file, as it contains handlers for intersection operations between different types of sets. Checking for duplicates and possibly ensuring order for canonical processing in the __new__ method of the Intersection class is likely where the fix is needed. The sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py file is also relevant because it involves the Piecewise function, which might be used or impacted by the results of the intersection operations involving duplicates.",

The '_handle_finite_sets' method within the Intersection class also appears relevant as it deals with the handling of intersections involving finite sets, which is a key aspect of handling duplicates within the context of intersections. Additionally, the 'simplify_intersection' function, also within 'sympy/sets/sets.py', is relevant as it simplifies the intersection and could be further modified to account for duplicate removal and canonical processing as suggested in the issue report.

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
