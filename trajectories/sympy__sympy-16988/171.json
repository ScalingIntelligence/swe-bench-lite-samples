The search results show relevant code spans within the `Intersection` class and the `simplify_intersection` function, which should be examined to ensure duplicates are handled correctly. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class and its methods are relevant to the expected output format for intersection results.",

The issue provides specific examples of desired behavior for the Intersection function.\n\nNext, I reviewed the existing file context, focusing on the sympy/sets/sets.py file, which is relevant because it contains the Intersection class and its methods. The Intersection class and its methods such as __new__, args, _contains, __iter__, _handle_finite_sets, as_relational, simplify_intersection, and _handle_finite_sets were particularly relevant.\n\nWhen processing the new search results, I examined both sympy/sets/sets.py and sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py. In sympy/sets/sets.py, I focused on the Intersection class and its methods, specifically the __new__ method, which is responsible for creating new instances of Intersection, and the _handle_finite_sets method, which deals with finite sets within intersections.\n\nIn sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py, I looked at the intersection_sets function, which is used to compute intersections between different types of sets. This was relevant because it supports the handling of intersections with various types of sets, which could be relevant for the reported issue.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, I determined that the relevant code spans are those in sympy/sets/sets.py that deal with the Intersection class and its methods, particularly how it handles finite sets and duplicates. Additionally, the intersection_sets function in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py is relevant for understanding how intersections with different types of sets are handled.",

Additionally, '_handle_finite_sets' in 'Intersection' is responsible for handling finite sets which might be relevant. In 'piecewise.py', the 'Piecewise' class and its methods are directly relevant to the expected output of the Intersection function, particularly methods dealing with evaluation and simplification. The 'intersection_sets' function in 'intersection.py' seems to handle specific types of intersections which could be relevant for broader understanding of intersection behaviors but doesn't directly address the duplicate handling in the Intersection class.",
