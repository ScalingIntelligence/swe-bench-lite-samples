Additionally, the Piecewise class from sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise should be examined for potential integration of Piecewise function definition.",

In 'Intersection.__new__', the method checks for duplicates by converting arguments to SymPy objects and performing an intersection operation if 'evaluate' is True.\n2. In 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets', the method specifically handles finite sets, which might be relevant for treating duplicates and ensuring canonical processing.\n3. In 'Piecewise.__new__', the method constructs the Piecewise object, which is crucial for returning the result in the desired format.\n4. In 'Piecewise.eval', the method evaluates the piecewise function, which can be used to handle cases where the intersection result needs to be represented differently based on conditions.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they deal with instantiation, evaluation, and handling of sets and piecewise functions, directly addressing the reported issue.\n\nMoving forward, the task involves refining the handling of duplicates within the Intersection class and ensuring the result can be appropriately represented using the Piecewise class.",
