The Intersection class appears to have methods that are likely involved in processing intersections, including handling finite sets. The Piecewise class, mentioned in the expected output, is not directly referenced in the provided context, but the presence of the Intersection class with its methods suggests that modifying or enhancing these methods could lead to a solution for handling duplicates appropriately. The complement function and the subtraction logic within the Intersection class are areas where duplicates could be addressed or influenced. Overall, the file context seems to include the primary components required to handle the issue, but a deeper investigation into the intersection logic and how it processes and removes duplicates would be needed for a complete fix. Additionally, the use of Piecewise might need consideration in the larger context outside the provided file, potentially influencing the 'complete' status.",

The new search results include additional implementations from sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py and sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py. The Piecewise class in the piecewise.py file is relevant because it handles piecewise expressions, which are mentioned in the reported issue.

Further, the handler methods for intersection operations in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py may include logic affecting how intersections are computed. To actionably address the issue, it's crucial to inspect the instantiation process of the Intersection class, methods like _handle_finite_sets for duplicate handling, and possibly extend search to instances where Intersection or Piecewise might be used with conditional logic.
