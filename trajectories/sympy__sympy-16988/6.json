I then examine the search results for relevant code spans, focusing on the Intersection class and its methods. I identify spans related to the Intersection class's '__new__' method and the '_handle_finite_sets' static method, which could both be involved in how the intersection operation handles sets. I also look at the ProductSet class's '__new__' method for context on how sets are combined or processed pairwise.

From the search results, we have identified several relevant code spans related to intersections and set operations. These include methods such as `Intersection._handle_finite_sets`, `Intersection.__new__`, `Set.intersect`, and `simplify_intersection`. These spans cover the instantiation of intersections, the handling of finite sets within intersections, and the simplification of intersections. The identified spans provide a solid foundation for understanding how intersections are currently handled and where modifications might be needed to address the issue of duplicate handling. Based on this analysis, we have selected the code spans that are most relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
