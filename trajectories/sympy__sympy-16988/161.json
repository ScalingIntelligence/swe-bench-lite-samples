The relevant files seem to be within the sympy/sets directory, particularly focusing on sets.py where the Intersection class is defined. Also, piecewise.py needs to be considered because it defines the Piecewise class which might be the expected output type for certain intersections. The _handle_finite_sets static method within the Intersection class is a likely candidate for handling these duplicates. Additionally, the simplify_intersection function in the same file might be relevant for ensuring intersection operations are handled correctly.",
