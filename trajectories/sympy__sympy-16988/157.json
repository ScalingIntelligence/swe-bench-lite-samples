The '__new__' method of the 'Intersection' class, which is responsible for constructing new instances of 'Intersection'.

The '_handle_finite_sets' static method within the 'Intersection' class, which deals with the intersection of finite sets. This method contains logic for iterating through elements of sets, checking for containment, and handling symbolic elements.\n4. The 'simplify_intersection' function, which includes various simplification strategies for intersection operations.\n5. The 'FiniteSet' class definition, which is relevant as it represents finite sets involved in intersection operations.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, which involves handling duplicates and ensuring canonical processing, these code spans are directly relevant.
