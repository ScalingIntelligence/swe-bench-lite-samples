The `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method is particularly relevant as it deals with the handling of finite sets during intersection, which aligns with the need to remove duplicates and order sets.

The primary focus is ensuring that duplicate elements are removed appropriately and that the intersection results are canonical. The provided file context includes relevant code spans for the Intersection class, its methods, and related functionality in sympy/sets/sets.py. The new search results bring more detailed implementations of the Intersection class and its methods. Notably, Intersection._handle_finite_sets() explicitly handles the intersection of finite sets and the removal of elements that are not common to all sets. This directly addresses the concern of removing duplicates. Additionally, the Piecewise class from sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py is also relevant as it can be used to represent conditional results, aligning with the requirement to return a Piecewise result or remain unevaluated based on conditions.",

The _handle_finite_sets method in the Intersection class appears particularly relevant, as it deals with the intersection of finite sets, which is directly related to the issue of removing duplicates in intersections. Additionally, the code includes the Piecewise class from the piecewise module, which is necessary for implementing the requested functionality to return results in the form of a Piecewise expression. The file context appears sufficient to address the issue, assuming that additional context about how these classes interact might be found elsewhere in the codebase. However, precise modifications to the existing methods or the creation of new helper methods would require a deeper dive into the specific methods of these classes.",
