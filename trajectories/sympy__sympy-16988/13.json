These spans are critical as they deal with the instantiation and evaluation of Intersection objects, the handling of finite sets (which could include duplicates), and the simplification of intersections. The issue suggests a need to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation, which implies modifications in '__new__' and '_handle_finite_sets', potentially impacting 'simplify_intersection' as well.

The provided code and context highlight aspects of the Intersection class such as its __new__ method, which controls the instantiation process, and the static method _handle_finite_sets, which is responsible for managing intersections involving FiniteSets. These are crucial to the resolution of the reported issue. Additionally, there is a reference to the simplify_intersection function, which is also closely tied to the evaluation of intersections. The new search results precisely include these relevant code spans, thereby addressing the need to understand and potentially modify the existing intersection handling logic to address duplicates and ensure proper evaluation of intersections. This analysis concludes that the search results provide the necessary code to further investigate and potentially resolve the issue reported.",
