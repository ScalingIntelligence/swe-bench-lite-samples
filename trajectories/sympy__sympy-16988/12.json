The provided files suggest that the Intersection class and related set operations are spread across multiple files. To address the issue, we need to focus on the Intersection class's instantiation method (_handle_finite_sets and __new__) and the intersection_sets handlers. Additionally, considering the need for handling Piecewise results, the Piecewise class should also be included in the search. Search should be directed towards the instantiation of Intersection and handling of intersection sets.",

The 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' static method could be relevant to ensure that finite sets are handled correctly during the intersection, as a first step to resolving the duplicates. The 'Piecewise' class and its methods such as '__new__', 'eval', and 'doit' are relevant to understand how the Piecewise function is structured and evaluated, as this function is the expected return type for the conditions described in the issue.

Specifically, the expected behavior is to remove duplicates at the outset and possibly order them for canonical processing. Given the current file context in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, it suggests that the `Intersection` class and its methods might be involved in the issue. The new search results confirm this, showing additional parts of the `Intersection` class and its method `_handle_finite_sets`. This is essential for understanding how intersections are currently processed and how duplicates might be handled. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant as it involves conditional logic which might be used to construct the expected results like `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))`. By examining these code spans, we can determine the extent to which the current implementation aligns with the reported issue.",
