The relevant files and methods to investigate are primarily in sympy/sets/sets.py and specifically focus on the Intersection and FiniteSet classes, as well as the handlers for intersection in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py. Additionally, understanding how Piecewise expressions are handled in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py will be necessary to verify or modify the behavior of the Intersection class regarding duplicates.",

The key elements identified in the reported issue are 'Intersection' and 'Piecewise', which should handle duplicates appropriately by removing them at the outset of instantiation. I reviewed the code spans in the search results and found that the 'Intersection' class in the sympy/sets/sets.py file already contains methods and properties that handle intersections, including '__new__', 'args', '_inf', '_contains', '__iter__', '_handle_finite_sets', 'as_relational', and 'simplify_intersection'. These methods are relevant because they address the creation, iteration, and simplification of intersections, which is critical for managing duplicates within the intersection operation as per the issue reported. Additionally, the 'simplify_intersection' function processes the arguments given to Intersection to simplify it, and '_handle_finite_sets' method specifically deals with finite sets within intersections. Hence, these pieces of code are pertinent to implement the functionality to remove duplicates from intersections, ensuring canonical processing and order of sets. Upon examining the relevance and completeness of the code spans, I determined that these search results do indeed contain code that is relevant to the reported issue.",
