Specifically, the issue expects that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that ordering should produce canonical processing. From the provided search results, the focus should be on the `Intersection` class and its methods, particularly those involved in the intersection operation and instantiation. Given the current context is empty, it's crucial to identify all relevant methods and properties within the `Intersection` class that might handle the instantiation and processing of intersection operations, including any methods that deal with evaluating, iterating, or simplifying intersections. Notably, the `__new__` method initializes the `Intersection` instance, the `_handle_finite_sets` method processes finite sets within intersections, and the `simplify_intersection` function handles the simplification of intersection operations. These are key areas to focus on for relevance to the reported issue. As there are contexts provided, the task cannot be considered complete, and further analysis of these identified spans will be necessary to determine comprehensive relevance.",
