This method handles the evaluation of the intersection and includes logic to order the arguments, which could be relevant for canonical processing as suggested in the issue.\n\n2. The `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method is specifically designed to handle intersections involving finite sets. This method checks for duplicates and processes them, which directly addresses the issue of removing duplicates at the outset.\n\n3. The `simplify_intersection` function also plays a role in processing the intersection and could be where additional logic for handling duplicates more gracefully (as in the Piecewise example) might be added or modified.\n\n4. The `Piecewise` class from another file context is mentioned in the issue and appears to be used to represent conditional results, which might be needed if the intersection needs to return a result based on specific conditions rather than just an evaluated set.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans identified focus on the intersection handling and the potential for conditional results, aligning with the core requirements of the reported issue.",
