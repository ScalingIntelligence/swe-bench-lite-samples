The issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that ordering them will produce canonical processing. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans within the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file, particularly within the `Intersection` class and its methods, such as `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `as_relational`. These methods directly deal with the creation and evaluation of intersections, making them highly relevant to the issue. Additionally, the `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method is particularly noteworthy as it explicitly handles intersections involving finite sets, which could align with the need to remove duplicates. Furthermore, the `simplify_intersection` function in the same file is responsible for simplifying intersection results, which is also relevant to the issue. In the `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` file, the `intersection_sets` function and its dispatched methods are used to handle specific types of intersections, adding context to how intersections are computed for different types of sets. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how intersections are handled within the sympy library, making them highly relevant to the issue at hand.",
