The example provided shows that the intersection should consider duplicates and either evaluate as `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated. The current codebase has already identified relevant files and spans which include the `Intersection` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `__iter__`, and `_handle_finite_sets`. The new search results confirm these spans and add context around how intersections handle finite sets and simplify. The method `_handle_finite_sets` is particularly relevant as it processes intersections involving finite sets, which is key to addressing the issue of duplicates. The search task appears to be complete with the identification of relevant code spans in the `Intersection` class and associated utility functions.",
