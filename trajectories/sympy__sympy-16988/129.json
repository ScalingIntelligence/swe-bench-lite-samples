Given the examples provided, it seems the Intersection class should handle duplicates at the instantiation level and potentially use Piecewise for conditional evaluations. The relevant files appear to be those handling set operations, particularly intersection and possibly Piecewise for conditional logic. Since the Intersection class and its methods are already identified as relevant, focusing on the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file and the 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' file would be appropriate. Additional focus should be on how 'Intersection' handles 'FiniteSet' and '_handle_finite_sets' logic, as well as the static method '_handle_finite_sets' which might be responsible for initial duplicate removal.",

For the expected Piecewise output, the 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' file contains the Piecewise class, which is crucial. Additionally, the _handle_finite_sets static method in the Intersection class should be examined for how it processes sets, which might include duplicates.
