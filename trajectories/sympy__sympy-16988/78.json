The search results contain relevant sections of the code which are critical for understanding and modifying the behavior of the Intersection function. The Intersection class definition and its `__new__` method are particularly relevant as they handle the instantiation and evaluation of intersections. The `_handle_finite_sets` method is also important as it deals with intersections involving finite sets, which is likely where duplicates can occur. The relevant spans include the entire Intersection class, particularly the `__new__` and `_handle_finite_sets` methods, as they are directly involved in the operational logic of intersections. Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function is part of the evaluation process and thus relevant. The FiniteSet class, although not directly modified, is relevant as it is manipulated within the intersection logic. These sections collectively provide a comprehensive view of the intersection handling mechanism, enabling an informed approach to resolving the issue of removing duplicates appropriately.",

The Intersection class's __new__ method includes logic that evaluates intersections if the 'evaluate' flag is set to True, which it is by default (unless global_evaluate[0] is False). The evaluation involves filtering and simplifying the intersection through the _handle_finite_sets static method. This method takes care of intersections involving FiniteSets by iterating through the elements and checking their containment in other sets. If an element is found in all other sets, it is included in the result; if it cannot be determined, it is flagged for further symbolic handling. This suggests that the method does not explicitly remove duplicates but rather checks for the presence of elements in each set of the intersection operation. Given this understanding, the focus should now turn to ensuring that duplicates are appropriately managed during this process, perhaps by implementing sorting or a uniqueness check during the generation of the result FiniteSet. Moreover, the intersection_sets functions in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py should be scrutinized for how they handle intersections between different types of sets, ensuring that the handling of duplicates remains consistent across the various set types supported by these functions.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
