From the provided context, it's clear that the Intersection class is in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and it involves methods like __new__ and _handle_finite_sets. Additionally, the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' might be relevant for handling conditional outputs. The intersection_sets function in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' is also likely involved in the logic for intersections. Given the issue's nature, focusing on these specific parts of the codebase would be prudent.",

The provided search results include several relevant code spans: 1. The Intersection class definition and its methods, particularly _handle_finite_sets which manages intersections involving FiniteSets. 2. The simplify_intersection function, which simplifies intersections and uses _handle_finite_sets. 3. The FiniteSet class, which is directly involved in the intersections. 4. The Piecewise class, which is relevant for the expected output in the form of Piecewise expressions. Based on the issue, the primary focus is on identifying and potentially modifying the intersection handling logic to correctly manage duplicates and evaluate intersections as expected. The identified code spans directly address this, suggesting they are relevant to the reported issue. Further examination of the Intersection class and its methods would be beneficial to ensure all relevant logic is captured. However, the provided search results already include critical components related to intersections and their simplification, making them suitable for addressing the issue at hand.",
