The main concern is the handling of intersections involving duplicates, where the expected behavior is to remove duplicates and potentially use Piecewise for conditional results. The analysis of the search results reveals several key components that might be directly related to the issue: the Intersection class, especially its __new__ and _handle_finite_sets methods, which deal with the creation and processing of intersections, including handling finite sets. Additionally, the FiniteSet class and the simplify_intersection function are crucial as they interact directly with intersection operations. These sections of code might need to be adjusted or understood better to ensure that duplicates are appropriately handled and the expected behavior is achieved. The current context does not identify any specific files or spans as relevant, so the focus is on understanding the functionality within the Intersection and related classes to see if modifications or additions are needed to resolve the reported issue.",

The goal is to ensure that the intersection operation returns the correct result without duplicates and that the result can be canonicalized by ordering the sets. From the file context provided, the critical spans of code involve the definition of the Intersection class, its __new__ method, and the handling of finite sets within intersections. These sections are essential for understanding and addressing the issue. The new search results, specifically in the intersection.py file, provide additional handlers for intersections involving specific types of sets (like ConditionSet, Interval, Range, and Naturals) and a function for handling intervals with integer-like properties. These add context for how the intersection operation is specialized for different set types, which is relevant for ensuring the correct handling of duplicates and order during intersections.",
