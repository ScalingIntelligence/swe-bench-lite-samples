This suggests that the __new__ method of the Intersection class might need to be adjusted to remove duplicates upon instantiation. Additionally, since the issue mentions Piecewise expressions, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py might also be relevant. The Intersection class itself is located in sympy/sets/sets.py, and other related set operations are likely to be handled in the same directory or in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py.",

The '__new__' method is particularly important for instantiation and potentially handling evaluation behavior.\n\nIn 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py', the Piecewise class definition and its methods such as '__new__' and 'eval' are relevant.

The new search results also include similar spans from sympy/sets/sets.py and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, particularly focusing on the Intersection class's properties and methods, and the Piecewise class, which is likely relevant for handling conditional expressions as suggested in the issue. The analysis should consider how these code spans might relate to the handling of duplicates or the creation of conditional expressions based on the variable 'x'. The relevance of each span will be determined by its direct involvement in defining or manipulating sets and their intersections, and by its potential to address the issue's requirements.",
