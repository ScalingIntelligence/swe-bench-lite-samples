The Intersection class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` seems to be the primary location for intersection operations. Additionally, the `_handle_finite_sets` method within the Intersection class might be a key method to check for handling finite sets, which could include duplicates. Furthermore, the `intersection_sets` function in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` likely processes intersections and could also be a place where duplicates are handled or should be handled. Lastly, since the desired output involves Piecewise, it would be beneficial to ensure that the Piecewise class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` can handle the intersections correctly if needed.",
