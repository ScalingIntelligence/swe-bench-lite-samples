To resolve this, we need to focus on the Intersection class and its methods, specifically the __new__ method where instantiation occurs. Additionally, the _handle_finite_sets static method within Intersection is likely involved in managing finite sets, which could include the logic for handling duplicates. To ensure thoroughness, also consider the intersection_sets functions in the handlers directory, as they may involve specific handling for intersections. The Piecewise class in the elementary/piecewise.py file should also be examined, as it is mentioned in the expected outcome of the intersection operation.",

The search results provided contain relevant code spans related to `Intersection` in `sympy/sets/sets.py` and `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`. Specifically, the code related to the `Intersection` class methods like `__new__`, `args`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `as_relational` are pertinent to understanding how intersections are handled and how duplicates might be processed. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant as it represents a way to handle conditional outputs which is suggested by the issue. The `Intersection.__new__` method is particularly interesting as it controls the instantiation of Intersection objects and might require adjustments to handle duplicates properly, potentially by removing them at the outset. Furthermore, the `Intersection._handle_finite_sets` method also appears relevant as it directly addresses the handling of finite sets within intersections, potentially involving duplicate elements. Given the issue's request for canonical processing, which might imply sorting the sets to handle duplicates in a consistent manner, the already identified code spans seem to cover the essential parts needed to address the issue, but further analysis of other methods like `__iter__` and additional parts of the `Intersection` class might be necessary to fully ensure all relevant code is considered.",

The analysis of the provided search results and the existing codebase indicates that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file. Specifically, the `Intersection` class and its methods, such as `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `as_relational`, are directly related to the functionality of the Intersection function and how it processes its arguments. These methods are designed to filter and simplify sets, handle finite sets, and return relational expressions, respectively. Given the context of the issue, these code spans are essential for addressing the requirement to handle duplicates and return the correct output format. There is no need for additional searches as the necessary code to address the issue is already identified and included in the analysis.",
