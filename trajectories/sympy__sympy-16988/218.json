Also, the intersection_sets dispatch functions in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py should be checked, as they handle the intersection operations between different types of sets. Additionally, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py is relevant as the issue mentions returning a Piecewise function or leaving the result unevaluated.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates a need to handle intersections in a more refined manner, particularly by removing duplicates and possibly returning a Piecewise function. The provided search results show the Intersection class and its methods, which are highly relevant to the issue. The Intersection.__new__ method, Intersection._handle_finite_sets, and Piecewise class are particularly of interest since they directly involve intersection logic and piecewise construction, respectively.\n\n1. **Intersection.__new__**: This method determines the behavior of creating an Intersection object and how it processes its arguments. This would likely need adjustment to account for duplicate removal and evaluation of intersections.\n\n2. **Intersection._handle_finite_sets**: This static method handles intersections involving finite sets. Understanding how duplicates are currently treated and how these sets are intersected could guide improvements in removing duplicates. It's also crucial if the intersection results require piecewise handling.\n\n3. **Piecewise Class**: Since the desired outcome includes returning a Piecewise function, this class and its methods are essential for constructing the output. Specifically, Piecewise.__new__ and Piecewise.eval methods help in creating New Piecewise objects based on conditions.\n\nGiven the relevance of these methods and classes, they should be considered the primary locations for implementing the required changes. The analysis does not reveal any missing or unaddressed parts crucial for resolving the reported issue based on the search results provided.\n\nHowever, the overall approach to removing duplicates and implementing piecewise structuring must be evaluated across these methods and possibly adjustments made to ensure the functionality aligns with the reported requirements.",
