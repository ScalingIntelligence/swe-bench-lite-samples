The desired behavior is to remove duplicates and possibly order them for canonical processing. Based on the context provided, the relevant files are primarily within the `sympy/sets` directory, specifically focusing on `sets.py` and `handlers/intersection.py`. The `Intersection` class and its methods, as well as the intersection handling functions in `handlers/intersection.py`, are key areas to investigate. Additionally, since the desired output includes `Piecewise`, it might be beneficial to check the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` for any relevant logic or checks that could be integrated or modified.",

The provided search results contain several relevant code spans, particularly those related to the 'Intersection' class, the 'Intersection.__new__' method, and the 'Piecewise' class. The 'Intersection.__new__' method is crucial as it performs the evaluation of the intersection operation. Additionally, the 'Piecewise' class is relevant for constructing the Piecewise function as a result. These spans handle the logic for intersection operations and constructing a Piecewise function based on conditions. They also include the handling of finite sets, which is pertinent to the issue of removing duplicates. Thus, these spans are highly relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue. Furthermore, the issue suggests ordering sets for canonical processing, which aligns with the use of the 'ordered' function in the '__new__' methods of both 'Intersection' and 'Union'.",
