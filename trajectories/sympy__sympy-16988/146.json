Given the context provided in the issue and the relevant files listed, the focus should be on the `Intersection` class and related methods, specifically on how duplicates are managed upon instantiation. The detailed description suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation, which implies a need to refine the `__new__` method and potentially involve the `simplify_intersection` function. Additionally, understanding how `Piecewise` is integrated to handle conditional intersections is crucial.",
