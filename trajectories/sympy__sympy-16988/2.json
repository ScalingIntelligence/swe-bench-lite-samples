This task likely involves both the Intersection class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and potentially the '_handle_finite_sets' static method within that class. The goal is to ensure that duplicates are removed and the intersection is processed in a canonical form. Further, the issue might involve using or modifying the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' to handle conditional results based on equating variables. Hence, two distinct search queries are made: one focusing on the Intersection class and its related methods, and the other on how Piecewise might be utilized or modified in handling such conditions.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
