Specifically, the intersection operation should remove duplicates and either return a Piecewise result or remain unevaluated if criteria are not met. 2. Current file context: No relevant code is identified yet, indicating a fresh start in the search. 3. Processing new search results: The search results provide relevant sections of code from sympy/sets/sets.py and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py. The Intersection class in sympy/sets/sets.py includes methods such as __new__, __iter__, _handle_finite_sets, and as_relational, which are crucial for the intersection operation. Additionally, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py contains methods like __new__, eval, and piecewise_integrate, which are relevant for the expected Piecewise output. 4. Identifying relevant code spans: The __new__ method in Intersection class (`Intersection.__new__`) is particularly relevant as it defines how the intersection operation is instantiated, potentially determining the removal of duplicates. The _handle_finite_sets method is also relevant as it specifically deals with finite sets, potentially handling the removal of duplicates. In the Piecewise class, the __new__ method is relevant for constructing the Piecewise object and the eval method checks conditions for each piece. 5. Conclusion: The identified code spans cover the main functionalities needed to address the reported issue. The Intersection class methods will handle the intersection logic, removal of duplicates, and potentially invoking the Piecewise class if necessary. The Piecewise class methods will manage the condition-based expression handling, crucial for the reported issue.",

The issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n\nI've reviewed the current file context, which includes the `Intersection` class with its `__new__` method, the `_handle_finite_sets` static method, and the `simplify_intersection` function. These parts of the code handle the instantiation and simplification of intersections.\n\nNext, I examined the new search results, focusing on the `Intersection` class methods such as `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and the properties like `args`, `is_iterable`, `_inf`, `_sup`, `_contains`, and `__iter__`. I also looked at the `FiniteSet` class and its `__new__` method.\n\nThe relevant code spans include:\n1. `Intersection.__new__`: This method is responsible for the instantiation of the `Intersection` object and handles the evaluation, including the call to `simplify_intersection`.\n2. `Intersection._handle_finite_sets`: This method specifically deals with finite sets during intersection operations, which is crucial for handling duplicates and ensuring canonical processing.\n3. `simplify_intersection`: This function simplifies intersections and calls `Intersection._handle_finite_sets`, making it an important part of the process.\n\nBased on the analysis, I have identified the relevant code spans that align with the reported issue and will provide them in the response.",

Specifically, it mentions that duplicates should be removed and how the function should handle intersections involving sets like `{1}` and `{x}`. The issue suggests that the result should be a Piecewise function, indicating different outcomes based on whether `x` is equal to 1 or not. The current file context already has relevant parts of the `sets.py` file, such as the `Intersection` class and its methods, including `__new__` and `_handle_finite_sets`. The new search results also include these parts, mainly focusing on handling finite sets within intersections. Additionally, relevant parts of the `piecewise.py` file are included, specifically the `Piecewise` class and its methods for constructing piecewise functions based on conditions. These parts are relevant for implementing the desired functionality of returning a Piecewise result based on whether `x` is equal to 1 or not. Overall, the identified code spans are crucial for addressing the reported issue, as they directly relate to implementing the required functionality in the Intersection class and using the Piecewise class to construct the desired output.",
