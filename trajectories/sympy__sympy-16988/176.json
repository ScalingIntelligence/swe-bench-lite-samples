The provided search results contain multiple relevant sections that address the intersection operations and their handling of duplicates. The Intersection class and its associated methods appear to directly relate to the issue, particularly the __new__ method which specifies the createion logic of Intersection instances, focusing on evaluation or not, and the _handle_finite_sets method, which specifically deals with finite sets and intersection. These sections are crucial for understanding and modifying how duplicates are managed upon instantiation of the operation. Additionally, the FiniteSet class, though not explicitly addressed in the issue, is a necessary component for intersection operations as it defines the actual set members. Other peripheral functions and components, such as simplify_intersection, act as supporting tools for streamlining or adjusting intersection operations, suggesting they play roles in the broader strategy of handling intersections. Overall, with these items as the main points of interest, the relevant codebase sufficiently outlines the processes and concerns implicated by intersecting sets while managing duplicates gracefully.",
