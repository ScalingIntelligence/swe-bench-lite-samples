Specifically, it mentions handling duplicates and ensuring canonical processing by removing duplicates at the outset of instantiation. The relevant files include `sympy/sets/sets.py`, which contains definitions of `Intersection` and other set classes, and `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`, which handles intersection operations between different types of sets. Since the issue involves handling duplicates and possible need for ordering, the `Intersection` class's `__new__` method and `_handle_finite_sets` static method seem particularly relevant. Other files like `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/sets/fancysets.py` are also mentioned in the context but are less directly related to the instantiation and handling of duplicates.",

The initial file context provided relevant code spans related to the `Intersection` class, including its handling of finite sets and the `simplify_intersection` function. The new search results confirm the presence of the `Intersection` class and its methods, including `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, and `simplify_intersection`, which are crucial for understanding and modifying the intersection behavior. These spans contain the logic for creating an intersection, handling specific cases like finite sets, and ensuring the intersection is evaluated correctly. The provided code lacks explicit handling for removing duplicates within the intersection logic, which aligns with the reported issue.

The provided search results include the Intersection class, its methods for handling finite sets (Intersection._handle_finite_sets), and the simplify_intersection function. These are directly related to the issue as they handle the intersection logic and simplification of intersections, including those involving duplicates. The analysis of these code spans shows that they are essential for addressing the issue, covering the instantiation of Intersection, the handling of finite sets within intersections, and the simplification process.
