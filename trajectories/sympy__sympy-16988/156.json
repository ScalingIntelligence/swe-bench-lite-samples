The relevant code spans are likely within the sympy/sets/sets.py file, particularly within the Intersection class and its methods like __new__ and _handle_finite_sets. Additionally, handling of intersection operations in sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py could be relevant. To address the issue, a search should focus on the Intersection class methods and the intersection handling logic across these files.",
