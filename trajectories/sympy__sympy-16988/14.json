Additionally, since the expected output involves Piecewise, it's also relevant to check 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py'.

The issue suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset or canonical processing should handle them. We should look for methods where duplicates might be managed or where the intersection logic is implemented. The '__new__' method and the 'args' property in the 'Intersection' class appear to be relevant as they relate to the instantiation and argument handling of intersections. Additionally, the 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets' method checks the handling of finite sets which might include logic for removing duplicates or managing them in a set-like manner. The 'Intersection.__iter__' method is also relevant for iterating through the sets which might involve controlling duplicates during iteration if not handled earlier. Further, the 'Intersection.as_relational' method converts the intersection into a relational form which doesn't directly handle duplicates but is a critical part of the intersection representation. Thus, these methods and their corresponding spans are crucial to address the issue of removing duplicates in intersections. The 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' is not directly relevant to the handling of duplicates in 'Intersection' but is used for conditional evaluations, which might be considered if the final output involves condition-based results such as 'Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))' as suggested in the issue. However, its direct relevance is secondary compared to the methods within the 'Intersection' class itself.",
