The Intersection class and related methods in sympy/sets/sets.py are particularly relevant as they directly involve the Intersection function as well as handling empty sets and intersections with conditions. The Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py could also be relevant as the issue discusses the handling of Piecewise expressions.

The key elements identified in the issue are the Intersection class and its handling of duplicates. Furthermore, the expected output involves using Piecewise to represent conditional outputs based on set intersections. Given the existing file context and the newly provided search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the sympy/sets/sets.py and sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py files. The Intersection class, its methods, and the Piecewise class are critical for addressing the issue. Specifically, the __new__ method of the Intersection class and the eval method of the Piecewise class are central to understanding and potentially modifying the code to resolve the reported issue. The search results also confirm the presence of additional relevant methods and properties within the Intersection class that could impact the intersection operation, such as args, is_iterable, _inf, _sup, _contains, and __iter__. Consequently, the identified spans are the ones where the modifications or inspections would most likely need to occur to rectify the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The detailed context provided underscores the intricate interplay within the `Intersection` class and its associated methods in `sympy/sets/sets.py`. The `__new__` method of the `Intersection` class handles the instantiation of intersection operations, potentially using the `_new_args_filter` and `simplify_intersection` methods to manage arguments and simplify results, respectively. Given the requirement to address duplicate handling, the `simplify_intersection` function becomes a focal point. It might need modification or extension to ensure duplicates are removed at the outset of the intersection evaluation. Additionally, the iterative process within the `__iter__` method of the `Intersection` class could be examined for any implications related to duplicate handling. Further, the `intersection_sets` method in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` is pivotal for understanding different sets' interaction during intersection operations. It's crucial to ensure that the search results focus on these methods and their logic, seeking to align or modify functionalities to meet the requirement of removing duplicates at the outset of intersection operations.",

The `__new__` method of the `Intersection` class handles the instantiation of intersection operations, potentially using the `_new_args_filter` and `simplify_intersection` methods to manage arguments and simplify results, respectively. Given the requirement to address duplicate handling, the `simplify_intersection` function becomes a focal point. It might need modification or extension to ensure duplicates are removed at the outset of the intersection evaluation. Additionally, the iterative process within the `__iter__` method of the `Intersection` class could be examined for any implications related to duplicate handling. Further, the `intersection_sets` method in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` is pivotal for understanding different sets' interaction during intersection operations. It's crucial to ensure that the search results focus on these methods and their logic, seeking to align or modify functionalities to meet the requirement of removing duplicates at the outset of intersection operations.",
