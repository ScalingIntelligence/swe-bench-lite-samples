Key methods identified as relevant include `__new__`, `_handle_finite_sets`, `_contains`, `__iter__`, and `as_relational`. These methods deal with the instantiation, handling of finite sets, membership checking, iteration, and representing intersections as relational expressions. Additionally, the `simplify_intersection` function is crucial as it simplifies the intersection of sets, which aligns with the need for canonical processing. The analysis of the search results confirms the presence of these methods and additional related functionalities, providing a comprehensive view of the codebase relevant to the reported issue.",

Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
