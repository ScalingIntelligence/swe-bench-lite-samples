The desired behavior is for duplicates to be removed at the outset of instantiation. This can be achieved by ensuring that the _handle_finite_sets method in the Intersection class properly de-duplicates the sets being intersected. Additionally, the intersection logic in sympy.sets.handlers.intersection.py should be reviewed to ensure that duplicates are not re-introduced during the intersection process. The Piecewise class in sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise.py is relevant as it is the type of output expected under certain conditions (when Eq(x, 1) is True or False).",

This suggests that the 'Piecewise' class may be used in handling the results of intersections, especially when dealing with conditions and expressions.
