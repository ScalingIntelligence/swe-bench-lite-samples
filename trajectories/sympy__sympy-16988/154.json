The task is to ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation in the Intersection class. The relevant files and classes have already been identified in the file context, particularly focusing on the Intersection class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and related intersection handling in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py'. Additionally, the Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' might also be relevant for the expected output format. The search should specifically target these areas to address the issue of removing duplicates in intersections.",

Specifically, the 'Intersection' class in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' and the 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' are of primary interest. The 'Intersection' class spans cover the functionality related to intersection operations, including the '__new__' method that controls the instantiation and evaluation logic. The 'Piecewise' class spans are relevant as the expected output is a Piecewise object or an unevaluated expression. These spans include methods and properties related to the evaluation, conditions, and handling of piecewise functions. Together, these spans provide a comprehensive view of the existing code that is likely involved in handling intersections and defining piecewise functions, which is necessary for addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Intersection should remove duplicates\n```python\r\n>>> Intersection({1},{1},{x})\r\nEmptySet()\r\n>>> Intersection({1},{x})\r\n{1}\r\n```\r\nThe answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.\r\n\r\nThe routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present; my initial guess is that duplicates should just be removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering them will produce canonical processing.\n"
