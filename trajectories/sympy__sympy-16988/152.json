This should ensure canonical processing and the correct evaluation of intersections, potentially involving Piecewise functions and handling of EmptySet. The relevant files to focus on are those that define the Intersection class and its methods, as well as any helper functions or classes that might be involved in the intersection logic, such as simplify_intersection and methods like _handle_finite_sets in the Intersection class. Additionally, the Piecewise class in sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py should be reviewed to ensure the correct construction of piecewise expressions.",

Given the nature of the issue, the focus should be on examining the implementation of the Intersection class and its associated methods. The search results provided include several relevant code spans from the 'sympy/sets/sets.py' file, which define the Intersection class and its methods. These methods are crucial for understanding how intersections are handled, including potential areas for improvement related to removing duplicates and evaluating intersections. The 'Intersection._handle_finite_sets', 'Intersection.__new__', and 'Intersection.__iter__' spans are particularly relevant as they deal directly with the processing and evaluation of intersections. Additionally, the presence of the 'Piecewise' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' suggests that it might be used to implement the desired behavior of returning a Piecewise result under certain conditions, aligning with the requirement in the reported issue.",
