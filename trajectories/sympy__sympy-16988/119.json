Given the context, the Intersection class and its associated methods in 'sympy/sets/sets.py' are likely places to start. Additionally, the 'intersection_sets' function in 'sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py' should be reviewed as it deals with the intersection operations between different set types. The Piecewise class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' might also be relevant as it is mentioned in the expected output, suggesting conditional logic based on the values of 'x'. Finally, understanding how 'Intersection' and 'Piecewise' interact in the context of set operations and conditional logic is crucial.",

Specifically, it suggests that duplicates should be removed at the outset of instantiation and that ordering them will produce canonical processing. Given this, the relevant code spans should include the instantiation of the Intersection class, particularly the part where arguments are processed and potentially duplicates are handled. The search results provided include the Intersection class definition and its `__new__` method, which is responsible for instantiating the class and processing the arguments. Additionally, there is a `_handle_finite_sets` method that deals with finite sets within the Intersection class, which could potentially handle duplicates. Therefore, these code spans seem directly relevant to addressing the reported issue. Furthermore, the Piecewise class and its methods are included as they might be used to represent the desired output format with conditions, as shown in the example provided in the issue.",
