However, the specific handling of string inputs within mutual_info_score and its dependence on check_array from sklearn.utils.validation for contingency matrix validation are key areas of concern. Additionally, the traceback indicates issues with string-to-float conversion in check_array, suggesting a need to explore how strings are processed and why this might differ between version 0.21.1 and later versions.
