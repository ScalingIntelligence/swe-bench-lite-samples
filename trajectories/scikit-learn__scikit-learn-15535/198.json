The specific problem is that converting a string array to float is causing a `ValueError`, whereas in previous versions, it worked without warnings. The code spans provided include the `mutual_info_score` function and utility functions like `check_array` and `check_X_y` which are likely used for validation of inputs. These functions are crucial for understanding how array types are managed and checked for compatibility in the sklearn library. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the handling of data types within these functions will be key to identifying the relevant code spans for the reported issue. Specifically, the `mutual_info_score` function's handling of inputs and the `check_array` function's type conversion mechanisms are likely areas of interest.",
