The error occurs when using the `.astype(object)` method on the input array, which suggests a problem with type conversion and validation within the function.\n\nTo address this, I examined the provided search results. The `mutual_info_score` function in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` is directly related to the issue, as it handles the calculation of mutual information and includes checks for contingency matrices. This is the core functionality where the regression might be occurring.\n\nThe `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is also relevant, as it is responsible for type checking and conversion of arrays. This function is called within `mutual_info_score` to validate the contingency matrix, and it appears to handle type conversions, including from object types to numeric types. This is likely where the issue of string conversion to float arises.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, both these functions need to be reviewed for proper handling of string inputs and type validation. The `mutual_info_score` function is crucial as it directly processes the inputs that cause the regression, while `check_array` is essential for understanding and fixing the type conversion process.\n\nTo conclude, the provided search results are relevant to the reported issue as they contain the functions responsible for handling and validating the inputs in question.",
