The issue describes how the function behaves differently with and without `.astype(object)` and mentions a `ValueError` when trying to convert string to float. This suggests that the input validation might not be correctly handling certain types of input data.\n2. The current file context shows two relevant spans - one in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` and one in `sklearn/utils/validation.py`. These files contain the `mutual_info_score` function and the `check_array` function, respectively. Both are crucial for understanding the input validation process.\n3. In the new search results from `sklearn/utils/validation.py`, there are several spans, including `_assert_all_finite`, `as_float_array`, `_ensure_no_complex_data`, and `check_array`. These functions are related to data validation and type conversion, which are directly relevant to the reported issue.\n4. The `_assert_all_finite` function checks for NaN and inf values in the input array, which is crucial for ensuring data integrity. The `as_float_array` function converts input data to a float array, which is relevant given the issue's mention of string conversion to float.\n5. The `_ensure_no_complex_data` function ensures that the input array does not contain complex data types, which could be a potential source of error if not handled correctly. The `check_array` function is a comprehensive function that performs various checks and conversions on the input array, ensuring it meets the required criteria for further processing.\n6.
