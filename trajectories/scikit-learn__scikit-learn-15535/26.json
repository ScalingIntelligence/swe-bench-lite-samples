The user is comparing the behavior of the function with and without the `.astype(object)` method, and it is noted that the version 0.21.1 did not produce warnings. \n\nIn the search results, we find the implementation of the `mutual_info_score` function in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` file. This code spans includes the definition and processing of the `mutual_info_score` function which indicates heavy handling of input arrays potentially related to the issue. \n\nAdditionally, in the `sklearn/utils/validation.py` file, there are multiple code spans that handle various aspects of input validation and conversion. Particularly, the `as_float_array` function is relevant because it explicitly mentions handling the conversion of input arrays to float, which might be related to the string-to-float conversion issue mentioned in the report. Other spans such as `check_array`, `check_X_y`, and `_ensure_no_complex_data` are also relevant because they handle different aspects of data validation which might be where the error in the input validation process occurs.\n\nOverall, the provided code spans appear to be directly relevant to the issue report and suggest the need to revise the type handling and validation within the function.",

The `mutual_info_score` function processes inputs through `check_clusterings` and `contingency_matrix` before proceeding with numerical computations. The `check_array` function, on the other hand, deals with ensuring data formats and types, including conversions between different data types. The detailed inspection of `check_array` reveals that it converts object types to float if the `dtype` is set to 'numeric'. This conversion might be the source of the error when handling string inputs, as strings cannot be directly converted to float, causing the ValueError.

The changes involve more explicit type checking and potentially stricter enforcement of data type validation, which could explain why the ValueError is now triggered when strings are encountered.
