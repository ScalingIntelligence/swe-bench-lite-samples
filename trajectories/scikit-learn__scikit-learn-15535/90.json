From the provided search results, both `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` and `sklearn/utils/validation.py` are relevant because they contain functions and methods essential for validation and input handling.\n\nIn `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py`, the `mutual_info_score` function directly involves the use of `check_array` from `sklearn/utils/validation.py`. This function is crucial for handling and validating the array passed to `mutual_info_score`. The `check_array` function inside `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is responsible for ensuring the array is in the correct format, particularly dealing with dtype conversions and ensuring the data is finite. Since the issue arises from string inputs not being properly converted or handled, these two spans in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` and the `mutual_info_score` definition in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` are directly relevant.\n\nAdditionally, the `_ensure_no_complex_data` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` could be indirectly relevant as it ensures the data does not contain complex numbers, which might also align with ensuring data type integrity.

This function handles the conversion and validation of array types, including handling of complex data and ensuring finite values. The issue mentions a specific error related to string conversion, and the check_array function does include logic for converting object types to float64, which could be relevant to the issue. However, the specific error described ('ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'b'') is not directly addressed by the provided code. Given the context, it appears that the relevant function is identified, but the exact cause of the ValueError needs further investigation which may involve checking other parts of the codebase or commit histories for changes around version 0.21.1.",
