When using strings in the input array with .astype(object), it raises a ValueError, while without the type conversion, it works but with a warning. The key part of the issue involves understanding how the input array is being processed and validated within the mutual_info_score function and related utility functions like check_array in sklearn/utils/validation.py. This suggests a need to review and possibly update the validation checks within the check_array function to handle the case where the input array contains strings correctly without raising a ValueError or unnecessary warnings. The search results include relevant sections of code that handle the validation of arrays, including _assert_all_finite and check_array. These sections are critical for determining how input data is being checked for finiteness and type correctness, which directly relates to the issue reported. By examining these functions, we can identify potential misconfigurations or oversights in handling string data, leading to the observed behavior. Consequently, the relevant code spans to focus on are those within check_array and possibly _assert_all_finite, as they are central to the input validation process.",
