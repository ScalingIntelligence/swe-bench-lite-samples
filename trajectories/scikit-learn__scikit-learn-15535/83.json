The function handles the contingency matrix and checks for nonzero values, which might be relevant in understanding how the function processes different data types, especially strings.\n\n2. **`check_array` function (`sklearn/utils/validation.py`)**: This function is crucial as it performs the validation and conversion of input arrays, handling different data types and ensuring they meet the required criteria. This includes checking for numeric types and handling potential issues with non-numeric or object types, which is directly related to the reported issue of string handling.\n\nBy analyzing these two code spans, we can identify where the specific regression lies and determine if the identified code is complete or if further information from additional parts of the codebase is needed.",
