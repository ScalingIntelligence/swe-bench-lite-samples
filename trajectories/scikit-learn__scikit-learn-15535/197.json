            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a regression in the input validation of clustering metrics when using the `mutual_info_score` function from `sklearn.metrics.cluster`. The error occurs when the input array is of type `object` and contains strings, which cannot be converted to float, leading to a `ValueError`. This behavior changed from version 0.21.1, where it worked without warnings.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, it is evident that the issue is primarily related to the `mutual_info_score` function and the `check_array` function within `sklearn.utils.validation`. The `mutual_info_score` function handles the calculation of mutual information, and it uses `check_array` for input validation. The `check_array` function is responsible for ensuring the input array is in the correct format, including type conversion, especially from object types to numerical types.\n\nThe issue can be traced to how `check_array` handles object arrays. Specifically, the function attempts to convert object arrays to float, which fails when the array contains strings. This aligns with the error in the reported issue where strings cannot be converted to float, resulting in a `ValueError`.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans that directly address the issue: the `mutual_info_score` function and the `check_array` function. The analysis of these functions indicates that the root cause of the regression is the handling of object arrays in `check_array`. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
