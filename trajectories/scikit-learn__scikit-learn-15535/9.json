            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a regression in input validation for the `mutual_info_score` function, specifically when dealing with string data types. The issue describes how calling `mutual_info_score` with an array of strings works with a warning but fails when the array is converted to an object type, which used to work without a warning in a previous version (0.21.1). This suggests a need to review how string data types are handled in the `mutual_info_score` function and the `check_array` function it relies on for input validation. In examining the provided search results, the `mutual_info_score` function and `check_array` function implementations are found:\n\n1. In `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py`, the `mutual_info_score` function is defined, which uses `check_clusterings` and `contingency_matrix` internally. It also directly uses `check_array` if a contingency matrix is provided, indicating a direct connection between the function's operation and the input validation process.\n\n2. In `sklearn/utils/validation.py`, the `check_array` function is defined, which includes several checks and conversions for the input array, including handling of numerical dtypes and complex data types. The function also raises errors or warnings based on the array's shape and contents, suggesting that this is where problematic string-to-float conversions might occur.\n\nGiven the detailed code spans in both files, it is clear that these functions are central to the reported issue. The `mutual_info_score` function's handling of input data and dependencies on `check_array` for input validation directly address the issue of how string data types are managed, particularly when converting to float or handling object dtypes. The `check_array` function's detailed handling of data types and the array's shape is crucial for understanding and potentially correcting the regression described. Thus, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be considered in any fixes or further investigation regarding the regression.",

The task is to identify code spans that are relevant to this issue, specifically focusing on how string inputs are handled in these functions.

The issue describes that when a numpy array is cast to `object` type, it raises a `ValueError`, whereas it works with a warning when not cast. This suggests that there's a problem with type checking or type conversion within the `mutual_info_score` function or its dependencies. From the initial file context, it's clear that `mutual_info_score` uses `check_array` from `sklearn.utils.validation`, which includes checks for type conversions and finite values. In the new search results, there are additional spans within the `validation.py` file related to `_assert_all_finite`, `as_float_array`, and `check_array`. These spans are relevant because they handle data type conversion, checking for finite values, and ensuring that the array is in the correct format. We can identify these as relevant to the issue because they directly deal with the transformations that might be leading to the `ValueError` in the case of `object` type arrays.",
