From the file context and the new search results, it's evident that `check_array` is used within `check_clusterings`, which in turn is used by `mutual_info_score`. The code spans identified suggest that the `check_array` function might not be handling the conversion of object data types to float properly. Additionally, `mutual_info_score`'s usage of `check_clusterings` and `contingency_matrix` needs to be reviewed to ensure that the input validation and conversion process is robust and does not fail for edge cases like string input cast as object type.
