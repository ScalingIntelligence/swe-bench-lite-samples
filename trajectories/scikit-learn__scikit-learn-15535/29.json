This suggests that there may be checks or validations missing in the mutual_info_score function or related utility functions that handle input data type conversions. Given the context, the relevant files to investigate are likely those handling clustering metrics and input validation, such as sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py, sklearn/utils/validation.py, and possibly sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py for broader input validation checks.",

The issue arises when the input array contains strings ('a' and 'b') which are not implicitly convertible to float. The search results provide several utility functions from `sklearn.utils.validation` that could potentially be relevant for input validation. These include `check_array`, `check_consistent_length`, `check_X_y`, and others. The `mutual_info_score` function itself is found in `sklearn.metrics.cluster._supervised`, which calls `check_clusterings`. It's important to ensure that the input to `mutual_info_score` is validated before proceeding with the calculation. The `check_array` function in particular seems relevant as it ensures the input array meets certain criteria before processing. Additionally, examining how these validations have changed between versions (0.21.1 and the current) might be crucial for understanding the regression.",

The context provided includes relevant code spans from the `sklearn/utils/validation.py` and `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` files, particularly the `check_array` and `mutual_info_score` functions.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant span in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is `check_array`, which performs various checks and conversions on input arrays, including type conversions and finite value checks. This function is crucial for ensuring the input data is in the correct format before further processing.\n\nIn `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py`, the `mutual_info_score` function is central to the reported issue. It calculates the mutual information between two clusterings, and within this function, `check_array` is used to validate the contingency matrix. However, the main issue lies in how string inputs are handled, leading to conversion errors.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, it appears that the primary focus should be on enhancing the `check_array` function to handle string inputs more gracefully, possibly by converting them to a suitable numeric type or raising a clearer error message if conversion is not possible. The `mutual_info_score` function should be able to call `check_array` without encountering errors due to string inputs.\n\nThe identified spans are crucial for addressing the regression issue, as they directly deal with the input validation processes that are failing in the current version.",

This function is crucial as it is used to validate and convert array-like inputs with specific handling for numeric types. This directly relates to the issue reported regarding the failure to convert string inputs to float in the `mutual_info_score` function. Additionally, `mutual_info_score` in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` directly calls `check_array` without specifying how to handle non-numeric types, such as strings, pointing to a potential gap in the validation checks for such inputs. Further investigation into the version history for changes impacting data type handling in `check_array` and related functions, especially between versions 0.21.1 and the current version, is necessary to fully understand the regression. Also, it is important to review other metrics or functionalities in `mutual_info_score` or its dependencies that could be affected.",
