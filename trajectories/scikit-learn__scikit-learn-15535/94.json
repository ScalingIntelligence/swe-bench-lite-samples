The issue seems to stem from how the function processes and validates input arrays. The search results provided include two key sections of code: 1) The `mutual_info_score` function in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py`, which directly relates to the function mentioned in the issue. This function checks and processes the input labels for clustering metrics but does not explicitly handle string inputs, which might lead to conversion or validation errors. 2) The `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py`, which is used within the `mutual_info_score` function to validate and possibly convert the input arrays. This function deals with data type checks and conversions, potentially causing the observed regression when strings are converted or not accepted. Given these findings, the relevant code spans are those directly involving the `mutual_info_score` function and its use of `check_array` for input validation. These spans are crucial for addressing the reported issue by ensuring appropriate handling and validation of string inputs without causing a `ValueError` or requiring unintended conversions.",
