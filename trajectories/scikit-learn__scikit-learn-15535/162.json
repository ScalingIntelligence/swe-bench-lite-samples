The issue mentions that converting the input array with `.astype(object)` results in a `ValueError`, while without this casting, the function works but with a warning. Given this context, the analysis focused on identifying relevant code spans related to `mutual_info_score` and input validation.\n\n1. **mutual_info_score Function**: The code for `mutual_info_score` is found in the first search result, providing the logic for calculating the mutual information between two clusterings. This function uses `check_clusterings` and `contingency_matrix` internally, suggesting that proper validation of input labels (`labels_true` and `labels_pred`) is crucial.\n\n2. **check_array Function**: The `check_array` function in the second search result is essential for validating array inputs, ensuring they meet specific criteria (like not allowing complex data types). This function is likely used within `mutual_info_score` to ensure that the inputs are valid before performing computations.\n\nThese findings suggest that the `mutual_info_score` function and its dependency on `check_array` for input validation are central to addressing the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans from `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` and `sklearn/utils/validation.py` are relevant to the problem.",
