The user observed a ValueError when using string arrays (with the `.astype(object)` method) and no error without it. This points to a potential issue in how the function handles data types, especially strings, during input validation.\n\nFrom the search results, several code spans are identified as relevant:\n1. The 'mutual_info_score' span contains the implementation of the function itself, which is central to the issue. It includes checks on the contingency matrix and computation logic involving data types, which could be where the error occurs.\n2. The 'contingency_matrix' span is also relevant as it is used within 'mutual_info_score'. It builds a contingency matrix that could also involve type handling and might be a root cause of the issue.\n3. The 'normalized_mutual_info_score' span uses 'mutual_info_score' and might be relevant due to potential indirect effects on type handling.\n\nGiven these spans, a closer look at the handling of array types within these functions, particularly around string conversion and numpy array operations, is necessary to determine the root cause of the issue.",

Additionally, the context includes other related functions such as `normalized_mutual_info_score` and `contingency_matrix`, which are also likely to be involved in handling input data correctly or incorrectly, depending on the bug. Thus, the file context does provide a relevant and substantial part of the codebase necessary to address the issue. The absence of explicit input validation checks for data types, especially handling string inputs, might be a key point to investigate further in resolving the reported regression.
