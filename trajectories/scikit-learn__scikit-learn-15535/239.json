The goal is to understand the code responsible for these behaviors and potentially identify any changes since version 0.21.1. \n\nThe analysis of the provided code spans reveals the following:\n\n1. The mutual_info_score function in sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py is likely the primary function where the issue occurs. This function checks and processes the input labels and calculates the mutual information score.\n\n2. The check_array function in sklearn/utils/validation.py is utilized within the mutual_info_score function to ensure that the contingency matrix is correctly formed and adheres to specific data type requirements. This function is crucial for understanding how input arrays are validated and potentially where the error or warning originates.\n\nBased on the reported issue, these two functions are highly relevant as they directly handle the input validation and computation for clustering metrics. Further inspection within these functions might reveal the exact location of the regression or change in behavior.",
