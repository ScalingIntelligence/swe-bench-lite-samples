Next, I will check for any utility functions or helper methods that might be involved in type checking or data preprocessing within the clustering metrics module.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is a regression in the input validation of clustering metrics, specifically with the `mutual_info_score` function from `sklearn.metrics.cluster`. The issue involves handling string inputs, where using `.astype(object)` results in a `ValueError` while without it, the function works but with a warning. The code provided demonstrates that this worked without a warning in version 0.21.1. Upon examining the current file context and the new search results, the relevant code spans are found primarily in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` and `sklearn/utils/validation.py`. Specifically, the function `mutual_info_score` is located in `_supervised.py`, and it uses `check_array` from `validation.py` to validate the input arrays. The `check_array` function is responsible for type checks and conversions, potentially handling the data type conversion issue observed in the example. From the new search results, the `mutual_info_score` function is the primary focus as it directly handles the computation of mutual information and could be where the faulty type handling occurs. The `check_array` function is also crucial as it is used within `mutual_info_score` to ensure the inputs are appropriate. Given the issue's nature and the identified code spans, the search task appears to be complete with relevant code spans that address the key concerns raised in the reported issue.",

In the new search results for `sklearn/utils/validation.py`, the `check_array` function is highlighted.
