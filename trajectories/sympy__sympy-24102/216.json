The reported issue suggests that the old `mathematica` function could parse such characters, but the new `parse_mathematica` function cannot. The analysis of the search results reveals several key spans that are relevant to the parsing process, including: \n1. The `MathematicaParser` class definition, which contains the transformations and rules for parsing Mathematica expressions into SymPy expressions. \n2. The `MathematicaParser.__init__` span, which initializes the parser with additional translations if provided. \n3. The `MathematicaParser._from_mathematica_to_tokens` span, which converts Mathematica code into a list of tokens. \n4. The `MathematicaParser._from_tokens_to_fullformlist` span, which converts the list of tokens into a nested list representing the full form of the Mathematica expression. \n5. The `MathematicaParser._from_fullformlist_to_fullformsympy` span, which converts the nested list representation into SymPy expressions. \n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the spans that are most directly relevant are those that handle the actual transformation and parsing processes (spans 3-5). It is within these spans that we would expect to find the code responsible for the handling of Unicode characters like '\u03bb'. However, the error message `SyntaxError: unable to create a single AST for the expression` suggests a problem within these transformation steps. The identified spans provide a clear context for further investigation and potential bug fixing.",
