The old function could parse Greek characters, but the new one raises a `SyntaxError`. The task is to find the relevant code spans that could be responsible for this issue. The search results include the `parse_mathematica` function, the `MathematicaParser` class, and the old `mathematica` function, all located in `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py`. Additionally, there is a span in `sympy/core/alphabets.py` listing Greek characters. The `parse_mathematica` function relies on `MathematicaParser`, which defines translations and rules for parsing, potentially affecting how character inputs, including Greek characters, are handled. The issue likely lies within the parsing logic or the AST creation process in `MathematicaParser`. Without specific implementation details of `MathematicaParser`'s `parse` method, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. However, it's essential to inspect the `parse` method and its interaction with character inputs to understand why Greek characters are not handled correctly.",

The `MathematicaParser._parse_old` method, which was used in the deprecated `mathematica` function, provides a detailed insight into how the input string was processed previously, potentially hinting at what might be missing in the new parser. It applies rules and replacements to the string before parsing it into a mathematical expression.
