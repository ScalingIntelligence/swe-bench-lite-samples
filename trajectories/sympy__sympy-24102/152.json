The task is to identify relevant code spans in the provided search results that pertain to the `parse_mathematica` function and any underlying classes or methods it utilizes. Given the context, it's especially important to focus on the `MathematicaParser` class and its methods as they are likely to contain the parsing logic. The search results provide a detailed look into the `MathematicaParser` class, including its initialization, conversion methods, and parsing logic. Specifically, the `__init__`, `_convert_function`, `_convert_one_function`, and `_parse_old` methods are relevant as they are involved in the parsing process and might need adjustments to handle Unicode characters correctly. Additionally, the `parse_mathematica` function itself is central to the issue as it delegates parsing to the `MathematicaParser` instance.",
