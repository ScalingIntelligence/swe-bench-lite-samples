The search results include several key methods within the `MathematicaParser` class, such as `_from_mathematica_to_tokens`, `_from_tokens_to_fullformlist`, and `_from_fullformlist_to_sympy`. These methods are relevant because they form the pipeline through which the expression string is processed and converted to a SymPy expression. Specifically, `_from_mathematica_to_tokens` converts the input string into tokens, and `_from_tokens_to_fullformlist` further processes these tokens into a full form list representation. The `_from_fullformlist_to_sympy` method then translates this full form list into SymPy objects. The issue likely involves a gap in tokenizing or parsing for certain characters like Greek letters in these steps. Therefore, these methods and the data structures they manipulate are critical for diagnosing and fixing the reported issue.",
