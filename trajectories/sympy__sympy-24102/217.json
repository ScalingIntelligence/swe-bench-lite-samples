The provided search results include several key sections of the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module. The imports section lists all the dependencies and functions that might be used in the parsing process. The `parse_mathematica` function is a simple wrapper around the `MathematicaParser` class, which is the core parser. The `MathematicaParser` class contains dictionaries (`CORRESPONDENCES` and `REPLACEMENTS`) and rules that define how Mathematica expressions are converted into SymPy expressions. The `CORRESPONDENCES` dictionary maps specific Mathematica functions to their SymPy equivalents, but it may lack mappings for certain characters like Greek letters. The relevance of these code sections is high because they directly involve the mechanics of parsing and could be the source of the reported issue. More specifically, the transformation from Mathematica syntax to SymPy syntax might not be handling non-ASCII characters like Greek letters. To address the issue, these sections need to be reviewed and potentially updated to include handling for such characters.",

The initial file context provides an overview of the functions involved, including the deprecated `mathematica` and the current `parse_mathematica`. Further examination is needed in the provided `MathematicaParser` class spans, particularly focusing on the tokenization and parsing methods involved in converting a Mathematica-style input string to a Python-compatible AST. The search results indicate the presence of methods `_from_mathematica_to_tokens`, `_from_tokens_to_fullformlist`, and `_from_fullformlist_to_fullformsympy`, which are likely core to the parsing process. A careful review shows that the parsing mechanisms are used to convert Mathematica syntax into SymPy objects, suggesting that the error in parsing Greek characters could be due to discrepancies in how characters are treated during the tokenization or the translation stages. Further investigation into these methods and their handling of special characters, including Greek characters, might yield the solution or expose the source of the issue.",

The search results show the relevant code spans that need to be analyzed to identify the cause of this issue. I'm focusing on the `parse_mathematica` function and the related `MathematicaParser` class methods. Specifically, the `MathematicaParser._from_mathematica_to_tokens` and `MathematicaParser._from_tokens_to_fullformlist` methods are crucial for understanding how the input string is processed into tokens and then into a SymPy-compatible expression. The issue might be stemming from the tokenization or the parsing logic that does not correctly handle non-ASCII characters like Greek letters. Additionally, the `MathematicaParser._from_fullformlist_to_fullformsympy` method converts the parsed list into a SymPy expression, which could also be where the handling of special characters might be failing.
