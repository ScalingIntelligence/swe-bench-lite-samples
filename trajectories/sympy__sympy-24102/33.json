This class is pivotal as it contains methods and translations that may directly impact the parsing capabilities, including handling of special characters. Given that the issue involves parsing different types of characters, the examination of the `MathematicaParser` class and its attributes, such as `CORRESPONDENCES` and `translations`, is crucial. These attributes define how Mathematica expressions are translated into SymPy expressions. Therefore, the relevant code spans for further investigation would be the `MathematicaParser` class definition, particularly focusing on the `parse` method and the initialization of the `translations` dictionary.",
