This issue seems to stem from differences in how the new `parse_mathematica` function handles character parsing compared to the deprecated `mathematica` function. The search results primarily focus on the `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` file, which contains critical functions and classes related to the Mathematica parser. The relevant code spans identified include the `parse_mathematica` function definition and the `MathematicaParser` class. The `MathematicaParser` class contains the `CORRESPONDENCES` and `REPLACEMENTS` dictionaries, which are crucial for translating Mathematica syntax into SymPy expressions. These sections of the code are likely where the bug causing the character parsing issue would be addressed. Since the main components directly related to parsing Mathematica expressions are present in the identified spans, this should be sufficient to begin diagnosing and fixing the issue.",

Additionally, the AST creation methods within `MathematicaParser` should be inspected to ensure they correctly handle and interpret the tokens generated from Unicode characters.

The old `mathematica` function could handle this correctly, but since its deprecation, `parse_mathematica` fails to handle such cases. The issue is identified as a bug needing resolution. It's clear from the provided code that `MathematicaParser` and its methods are central to the parsing mechanism. Specifically, the `parse_mathematica` function and the underlying mechanisms it uses (as seen in `parse`, `_from_mathematica_to_tokens`, `_from_tokens_to_fullformlist`, etc.) should be examined to determine why they fail to parse these characters. Additionally, Greek characters should be recognized within the parsing rules or tokenization process. The `greeks` set identified in a separate file might hint at previous or alternate handling of Greek letters in the parser context. Given the information provided, `span_ids` 'MathematicaParser', 'MathematicaParser.__init__', 'MathematicaParser._parse_old', 'MathematicaParser.parse', 'MathematicaParser:31', 'MathematicaParser._get_neg', 'MathematicaParser._from_mathematica_to_tokens', and 'MathematicaParser._is_op' in the 'sympy/parsing/mathematica.py' file are relevant as they pertain to the implementation and functions affected by the issue.
