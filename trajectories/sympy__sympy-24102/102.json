The 'parse_mathematica' span shows the function definition and how it interacts with the `MathematicaParser` class. The 'MathematicaParser' span contains the class definition, including mappings and rules that might affect how input strings are parsed. Specifically, the 'CORRESPONDENCES' and 'REPLACEMENTS' dictionaries within `MathematicaParser` could be relevant, as they show how Mathematica syntax is translated into SymPy syntax.
