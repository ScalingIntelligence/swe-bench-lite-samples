The issue suggests that the `parse_mathematica` function may have a bug that prevents it from parsing such characters. In the search results, the `parse_mathematica` function definition and the `MathematicaParser` class are both found, which are critical for understanding the parsing logic. Specifically, the `parse_mathematica` function simply initializes a `MathematicaParser` object and calls its `parse` method. The `MathematicaParser` class contains mappings and rules for translating Mathematica expressions into SymPy expressions but does not explicitly mention handling special characters like Greek letters. However, the class is responsible for the actual parsing logic, and any issues with character parsing would likely be resolvable by adjusting this class. The identified code spans from `parse_mathematica` and `MathematicaParser` are therefore relevant to addressing the issue, especially for debugging or enhancing character handling capabilities.",
