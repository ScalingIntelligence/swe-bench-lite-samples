The function's inability to handle Greek characters can potentially be traced back to how Unicode characters are managed and translated within the `CORRESPONDENCES`, `REPLACEMENTS`, and `RULES` dictionaries. \n\nThe `CORRESPONDENCES` dictionary maps Mathematica functions to their SymPy equivalents. Notably, there are mappings for various trigonometric and logarithmic functions, but none specifically for Greek characters. This suggests that Greek characters might not be directly recognized or translated within this context. \n\nThe `REPLACEMENTS` dictionary stores replacements for specific characters like spaces and curly braces, but it doesn't indicate any handling for Unicode characters like Greek letters. \n\nThe `RULES` dictionary contains regular expressions for formatting conversions, such as adding omitted multiplication signs and converting 'Pi' to 'pi'. However, similar rules for other Greek characters (which are commonly used in mathematical expressions) are not apparent. \n\nConsidering the historical handling of Greek characters in the deprecated `mathematica` function, it's reasonable to infer that they were implicitly managed through SymPy's generic handling of symbols, perhaps through the `sympify` function. In transitioning to `parse_mathematica`, this implicit management might need to be made explicit, especially for Greek characters that are not named in the dictionaries. \n\nThe file `sympy/core/alphabets.py` lists Greek characters, indicating their recognition within the broader context of SymPy. Therefore, it would be logical to scrutinize how these characters are treated within the `MathematicaParser` class and to explore whether specific entries for Greek characters in `CORRESPONDENCES`, or additional regular expressions in `RULES`, are necessary to facilitate their handling by `parse_mathematica`.",

The function's inability to handle Greek characters can potentially be traced back to how Unicode characters are managed and translated within the `CORRESPONDENCES`, `REPLACEMENTS`, and `RULES` dictionaries. The `CORRESPONDENCES` dictionary maps Mathematica functions to their SymPy equivalents. Notably, there are mappings for various trigonometric and logarithmic functions, but none specifically for Greek characters. This suggests that Greek characters might not be directly recognized or translated within this context. The `REPLACEMENTS` dictionary stores replacements for specific characters like spaces and curly braces, but it doesn't indicate any handling for Unicode characters like Greek letters. The `RULES` dictionary contains regular expressions for formatting conversions, such as adding omitted multiplication signs and converting 'Pi' to 'pi'. However, similar rules for other Greek characters (which are commonly used in mathematical expressions) are not apparent. Considering the historical handling of Greek characters in the deprecated `mathematica` function, it's reasonable to infer that they were implicitly managed through SymPy's generic handling of symbols, perhaps through the `sympify` function. In transitioning to `parse_mathematica`, this implicit management might need to be made explicit, especially for Greek characters that are not named in the dictionaries. The file `sympy/core/alphabets.py` lists Greek characters, indicating their recognition within the broader context of SymPy. Therefore, it would be logical to scrutinize how these characters are treated within the `MathematicaParser` class and to explore whether specific entries for Greek characters in `CORRESPONDENCES`, or additional regular expressions in `RULES`, are necessary to facilitate their handling by `parse_mathematica`.",
