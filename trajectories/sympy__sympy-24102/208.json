Reviewing the existing methods, especially `parse`, `_from_mathematica_to_tokens`, and `_from_tokens_to_fullformlist`, would be crucial to understand how the Mathematica expressions are being processed and possibly identify where the handling of special characters might be failing. Given the code spans provided in the search results, it becomes clear that the current implementation might not have the specific handling needed for non-ASCII characters like Greek letters. This gap in handling Unicode characters could be the root cause of the issue. Moreover, the presence of string processing in the `_from_mathematica_to_tokens` method suggests that it might be where Greek characters and possibly other special characters are getting misinterpreted or not processed correctly, leading to the SyntaxError mentioned. Addressing this gap by possibly enhancing the tokenization and string handling logic would be a necessary step to resolve the issue. Further revisions might include updating the regex patterns used in tokenization or expanding the character set considered valid in the input strings to encompass Unicode characters beyond the ASCII set commonly handled in the current parser logic.",

The `REPLACEMENTS` dictionary modifies specific characters, which could potentially affect Greek characters. The `parse` method, which orchestrates the main parsing steps, is also a key focus.
