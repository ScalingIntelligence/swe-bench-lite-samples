This can affect its ability to handle a variety of mathematical symbols beyond plain English characters. The old `mathematica` function could handle this correctly. It's suggested that this might be due to a bug in the new `parse_mathematica` function. The most likely area to investigate is within the `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` file, as this is where both the `mathematica` and `parse_mathematica` functions are defined. Specifically, focus should be on the implementation and any internal helper functions of `parse_mathematica` since the old function worked correctly. Additionally, checking any changes in imports or other configuration settings that might affect these parsers could also be beneficial.",

The reported issue points to the 'parse_mathematica' function specifically. In the provided search results, I observe that the 'sympy/parsing/mathematica.py' file contains the definition of the 'parse_mathematica' function and the 'MathematicaParser' class that it uses for parsing. This context and the definition of the parsing strategies within the class suggest a strong relevance. The inability to handle Greek characters likely involves a limitation in the 'MathematicaParser' class's methods for interpreting and translating Mathematica syntax into SymPy expressions, including handling special characters. Therefore, I concluded that the 'parse_mathematica' function and its associated 'MathematicaParser' class are critical to addressing the reported issue. Extracting these sections provides a focus point for further investigation or modification to correct the parsing problems for foreign and special characters, such as Greek letters.",
