The search results include the source file 'sympy/parsing/mathematica.py' which contains the new function `parse_mathematica` and the class `MathematicaParser` that it relies on. The `parse_mathematica` function simply initializes and calls a `MathematicaParser` instance, making it a crucial span to investigate further. The `MathematicaParser` class contains methods and variables that handle the parsing logic, including the `CORRESPONDENCES` and `REPLACEMENTS` dictionaries which might be relevant in handling character substitutions during parsing. Since the issue is about parsing characters that might not be directly mapped or handled by the current parsing logic, focusing on the `MathematicaParser` class and its methods for parsing will be crucial in identifying the root cause and potential solutions. Thus, the search results appear to be relevant and directly related to the reported issue, providing a good starting point for investigation.",
