The old `mathematica` function was able to parse Greek characters, but after deprecation and replacement with `parse_mathematica` in SymPy v. 1.11, Greek characters (and possibly others) are no longer parsed correctly. From the search results, I can see that `parse_mathematica` is calling a `MathematicaParser` class to handle the parsing. This class contains mappings and rules that might be the reason why Greek characters are not being parsed correctly. Since there is no relevant code already identified, the focus is on the provided search results. The relevant code spans include the `imports` for necessary modules, the definition of `parse_mathematica` which directly relates to the issue, and the `MathematicaParser` class which contains the logic for parsing mathematical expressions. By examining these code spans, I can identify the potential areas that might need adjustments to handle Greek characters or other special characters.",
