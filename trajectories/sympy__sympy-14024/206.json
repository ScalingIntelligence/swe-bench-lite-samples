The key operations needed to address this issue are related to exponentiation and simplification. The search results include several relevant spans in the 'sympy' codebase, particularly in files dealing with power operations and simplification. Specifically, the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py', the 'powsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', and the 'sign' function in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' are identified as potentially relevant. These spans include methods and attributes needed to handle exponentiation, simplification, and the properties of variables in mathematical expressions.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the identified spans provide a foundation for understanding and potentially resolving the inconsistency in the simplification process. The 'Pow' class and its methods provide the essential structures for defining and manipulating powers in symbolic expressions. The 'powsimp' function is specifically designed to simplify expressions involving powers, which is directly related to the task at hand. The 'sign' function and its associated methods are also relevant as they handle the sign of expressions, which can impact the simplification process when dealing with negative bases. Overall, these spans collectively offer a comprehensive framework for addressing the reported issue.",
