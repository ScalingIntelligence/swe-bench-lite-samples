This suggests that the problem could be related to how the simplification logic handles the negative sign and the exponentiation. Investigating the `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class and the `simplify` function in sympy.simplify is a good starting point. Also, since the inconsistency is seen when 'a' is a Symbol versus when 'a' is a specific value like 2, the assumptions and refinements related to these scenarios should be examined. Therefore, focusing the search on the `_eval_power` method in power.py and the simplification modules such as powsimp.py and simplify.py would likely yield the relevant code.",

This suggests issues with the handling of negative bases and simplification logic when dealing with symbolic and numerical bases.\n\nI analyzed the provided search results, focusing on the sections related to Pow (power operations), powsimp (power simplification), and logcombine (logarithmic combination) in the sympy codebase. These sections seem to be directly relevant to the issue as they involve the manipulation and simplification of powers and logarithms, which are central to the reported problem. The '_eval_power' method in the Pow class, the 'powsimp' function, and the 'logcombine' function are particularly important as they deal directly with exponent evaluation and simplification rules, which are key to resolving the reported inconsistency. Furthermore, the 'simplify' function in simplify.py, which calls 'signsimp', might also be relevant for considering the simplification of the overall expression.\n\nGiven the issue, the relevant code spans are identified in the sections where power and logarithmic operations are defined and simplified, which are crucial for handling the symbolic and numerical inconsistencies reported.",
