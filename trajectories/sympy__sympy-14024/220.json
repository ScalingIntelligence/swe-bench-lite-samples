The issue was highlighted when comparing the results of these operations with symbolic 'a' and specific numeric 'a' (like 2). The main focus is on understanding how the `simplify` function and related methods handle these expressions.\n\nNext, I reviewed the current context, which indicated no relevant code has been identified yet. So, the task is to identify relevant code spans in the provided search results.\n\nI then processed the new search results, focusing on code spans from four files: 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/core/numbers.py', and 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py'. These files are likely to contain the logic for simplifying expressions and handling powers.\n\nIn 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', I found the `powsimp` function, which is crucial for simplifying expressions with powers. This function uses various techniques to combine and simplify power expressions.\n\nIn 'sympy/core/power.py', I identified several methods related to the `Pow` class, including properties like `base` and `exp`, and evaluation methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_is_negative`, and `_eval_is_zero`.\n\nIn 'sympy/core/numbers.py', I found the `NegativeOne` class and its `_eval_power` method, which handles the exponentiation of -1, relevant since the expression (-a)**x * a**(-x) simplifies to (-1)**x under certain conditions.\n\nIn 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py', I found the `refine_Pow` function, which refines the properties of a `Pow` expression based on assumptions, which could be relevant for handling the inconsistent behavior when simplifying.\n\nBased on this analysis, I identified the relevant code spans that contribute to the simplification logic and could be related to the reported issue.",
