The analysis of the code spans focuses on the Pow class and related methods in the sympy/core/power.py file. The relevant methods include _eval_refine, _eval_power, _eval_is_negative, and _eval_is_zero, which handle various aspects of power simplification and evaluation. Additionally, the powsimp and powdenest functions in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py are relevant for simplifying and denesting powers. The NegativeOne class and its _eval_power method in sympy/core/numbers.py are also relevant as they handle the exponentiation of -1, which is a key part of the reported issue. The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is the main entry point for simplification, which also needs to be considered. Overall, these code spans provide the necessary tools to address the issue, and it seems that the search for relevant code is complete since all key functional components have been identified.",
