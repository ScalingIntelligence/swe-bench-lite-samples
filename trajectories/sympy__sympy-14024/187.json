The examples provided show different numerical results for the same expression when a is either a Symbol or a specific integer value. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that might be responsible for this inconsistency.\n\nThe search results include several files and code spans from the SymPy library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. The files and spans seem related to the handling of powers, simplification, and evaluation of symbolic expressions. The 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py' contains methods for creating and evaluating power expressions, including '__new__', '_eval_power', and '_eval_subs'. The 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' functions in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' are also relevant as they handle simplification of powers. The 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' is a general-purpose simplification function that might be used in the process. Lastly, the 'TR0' and 'TR111' functions in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' might also be relevant as they are part of trigonometric simplification strategies.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the relevant code spans are likely those that handle the creation, evaluation, and simplification of power expressions, particularly those involving negative bases or exponents. The identified spans include 'Pow.__new__' and 'Pow._eval_power' in 'sympy/core/power.py', 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', and potentially 'simplify' in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py'.",

The relevant files and methods likely involve the power-related functions and simplification routines in the sympy library. The provided file context includes 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', which contain the '_eval_power' method in the Pow class and the 'simplify' function. These files and methods seem to address the issue, as they handle power simplification, including how negative bases are treated in expressions. The file context provides a comprehensive view of how powers are evaluated and simplified in sympy, which is directly related to the reported issue. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the relevant code for addressing the issue is provided in the file context.",
