The issue compares how the simplification behaves when 'a' is a symbolic variable and when 'a' is a specific integer value (2). The focus is on the simplification logic and how it handles negative bases and exponents, particularly in the context of symbolic variables versus concrete values.\n\nThe current file context already contains several relevant spans from `sympy/core/power.py`, which include the `Pow` class and its methods such as `_eval_refine`, `_eval_subs`, and `as_numer_denom`. These methods deal with the refinement and substitution of expressions, which are critical for understanding the simplification behavior.\n\nThe new search results further detail the `Pow` class and its methods. Notable spans include `Pow.base`, `Pow.exp`, `Pow._eval_refine`, `Pow._eval_subs`, and `Pow.as_numer_denom`. These spans provide additional context about how the base and exponent are accessed and how the class handles refinement, substitution, and representing the expression as a numerator and denominator.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on power simplification and the provided code spans that cover key aspects of this process, it is reasonable to conclude that the search has uncovered relevant code spans necessary to address the reported issue.",
