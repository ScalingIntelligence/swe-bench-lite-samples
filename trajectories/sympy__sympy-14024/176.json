Specifically, it focuses on the behavior of expressions like (-a)**x * a**(-x) where 'a' is a positive integer. The inconsistency arises when substituting specific values for 'x', leading to different numerical results despite the expressions being simplified to the same form in the symbolic comparison. To address this, it's crucial to investigate the '_eval_power' methods in classes like Pow, Integer, and Rational, as well as the simplification logic in functions like simplify() and powsimp().",

The issue presents different behaviors depending on whether the base is a symbolic positive integer or a specific integer value. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans that handle these cases in the SymPy library.\n\nReviewing the search results, several key files and code spans appear relevant to the reported issue. The `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` is central as it handles power operations. Additionally, the `Expr.simplify` and `Expr.powsimp` methods in `sympy/core/expr.py` are likely places where the simplification logic for expressions, including those with powers, is implemented. The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is also crucial, as it is responsible for the top-level simplification logic, potentially calling other specific simplification methods.\n\nOther files such as `sympy/core/numbers.py` contain definitions of `Rational` and `Integer`, which are relevant since the issue involves simplification with positive integers. The `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is directly related to simplifying powers, particularly in combining and simplifying them.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified code spans from the search results are likely to be directly or indirectly involved in the handling of the reported issue. They provide a good starting point for further analysis or potential fixes related to the inconsistency in simplifying expressions with negative bases raised to variable exponents.",

The key parts of the codebase that are relevant are those that handle power simplification and evaluation. Observing the search results, several critical sections are found: 1. `powsimp` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - This function is responsible for simplifying expressions with powers. 2. Various `_eval_power` methods across different classes like `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, and `NegativeOne` in `sympy/core/numbers.py` - These methods handle power evaluation for different types of numbers. 3. The `__new__`, `base`, `exp`, `_eval_power`, and other methods in the `Pow` class from `sympy/core/power.py` - These methods are central to how powers are constructed, accessed, and potentially simplified in SymPy. 4. The `_eval_power` method in `Mul` from `sympy/core/mul.py` - This method is crucial for handling powers in multiplicative expressions. Given these snippets, it's clear that they are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue as they directly pertain to simplifying and evaluating powers, which are central to the problem.",
