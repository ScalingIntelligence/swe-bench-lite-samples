Relevant code spans are identified in the Pow class within sympy/core/power.py, which contains methods for evaluating properties and behaviors of powers, such as base and exponent properties, refining evaluations based on assumptions, and simplifying expressions. Additionally, the refine_Pow function in sympy/assumptions/refine.py is relevant as it directly deals with refining power expressions based on given assumptions. The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is also pertinent, as it orchestrates the simplification process and is likely to be involved in the reported issue's context.
