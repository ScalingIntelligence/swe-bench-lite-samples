The expressions are expected to simplify to (-1)**x, but there are discrepancies when a is a Symbol vs. when a is a specific number (like 2). This suggests that the simplification logic in the codebase might be handling Symbols and numbers differently. This issue is likely related to the methods that handle exponentiation and simplification of powers, particularly around the treatment of the base being positive or negative while maintaining the properties of the exponent. The code spans in the provided search results that are likely relevant include Pow class methods for evaluating properties like being negative or zero (_eval_is_negative, _eval_is_zero), and methods dealing with refining and simplifying powers (_eval_refine, powsimp, refine_Pow). Additionally, the _denest_pow function in powsimp.py suggests it might handle or relate to simplifying nested powers, which could be relevant to the reported issue. These sections of the code are crucial because they directly deal with the properties and transformations related to expressions involving exponents, which are central to the inconsistency described in the issue.",
