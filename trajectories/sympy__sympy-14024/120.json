The user observed different results when 'a' is a symbolic variable versus when 'a' is a specific integer value. This suggests that the problem might lie in the simplification logic for powers, especially where the base is negative or involves symbolic manipulation. The focus should be on detecting and fixing discrepancies in the logic that handles these cases. The provided search results include code spans from sympy's core power handling and simplification modules, which could be pertinent to resolving the issue. In particular, the `Pow._eval_power` method from `sympy/core/power.py` and the `powsimp` function from `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` are likely relevant due to their direct involvement in simplifying and evaluating powers. The `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` may also contribute to the issue as it handles refining properties of Power expressions based on assumptions.",
