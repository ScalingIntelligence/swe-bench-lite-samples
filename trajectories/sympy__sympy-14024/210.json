To address this, we need to look into the evaluation and simplification logic of powers, focusing on the Pow class and related simplification functions.

Additionally, the 'powsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' is directly involved in simplifying expressions involving powers, which is critical for resolving the issue. The 'refine_Pow' function in 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py' also plays a role in refining expressions involving powers based on assumptions.
