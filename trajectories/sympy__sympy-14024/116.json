The inconsistency arises when the base 'a' is a symbolic positive integer and when 'a' is a specific positive integer (like 2). The problem seems to be related to how the simplification handles these different cases, potentially related to the _eval_power method or the simplification logic. Therefore, the focus should be on files where power evaluation or simplification is handled, such as 'power.py', 'simplify/powsimp.py', and 'assumptions/refine.py'.",

The main focus is on the behavior of the simplify() function with different values of 'a' and 'x'. The search results include several relevant code spans from the Pow class in sympy/core/power.py and the powsimp function in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py. The Pow class contains methods related to exponentiation properties, simplification, and evaluation of power expressions. The powsimp function is directly related to simplification of power expressions. The code spans provide the necessary context to understand how the simplification of such expressions is handled in SymPy. Specifically, the _eval_power, _eval_refine, and _eval_expand_power_base methods in the Pow class, as well as the powsimp and powdenest functions, are particularly relevant. These parts of the code are responsible for handling the core logic of simplifying and expanding power expressions. By examining these spans, it is clear that they address the key aspects of the reported issue, such as handling different cases of base and exponent values, applying mathematical rules for simplification, and potentially addressing inconsistencies based on the nature of the inputs. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue.",
