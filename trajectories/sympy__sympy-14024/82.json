The problem seems to be related to how `simplify` and `_eval_power` methods handle these expressions, especially when `a` is a positive integer. We need to investigate the `Pow` class and its associated methods, as well as the `simplify` function. Given the code snippets provided, searching for 'def _eval_power' in relevant files should help locate the critical parts of the codebase dealing with power evaluation and simplification.",

The issue is exemplified with different values of 'a', showcasing discrepancies in the results of simplification, especially concerning the handling of negative bases within powers. To address this, we need to identify code spans within the Pow class (in sympy/core/power.py) and the simplify function (in sympy/simplify/simplify.py) that closely deal with evaluation of powers and simplification respectively. Key aspects to look for include methods handling power evaluations, simplification logic, and conditions for recognizing and handling negative bases in powers. The identified spans should focus on how powers are computed and simplified, particularly in scenarios where the base might be negative.",
