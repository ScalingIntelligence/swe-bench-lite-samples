The inconsistency arises when 'a' is symbolic versus when it is a specific integer value like 2. This discrepancy suggests that the simplification logic might be handling symbolic and non-symbolic cases differently, possibly due to assumptions about the properties of the base and exponent in different contexts. To address this, I need to look into the core power evaluation and simplification logic across the relevant files in SymPy. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on files related to power evaluation, simplification, and assumptions handling is crucial.",

The modifications ensure that the simplification to (-1)**x is consistent regardless of whether 'a' is a symbolic positive integer or a specific integer value. The change has been applied as verified by the git diff, and the updated behavior aligns with the expected simplification rules. No further changes are necessary.",
