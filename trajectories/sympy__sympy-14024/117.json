This points towards a potential problem in the handling of powers, specifically related to negative bases and their simplification. The relevant classes and functions in the context provided are focused on power evaluation, simplification, and assumptions about properties like positivity and negativity. To pinpoint the exact cause, it's necessary to examine how these operations are implemented and how assumptions affect them. The `_eval_power` method seems particularly relevant as it governs how powers are evaluated. Also, the `simplify` function and its interactions with expressions involving powers are central to solving this issue.",

The issue can be observed when the base is a positive integer symbol and when it is a specific integer value (2 in the provided examples). The goal is to identify code spans in the provided search results that are relevant to this issue, specifically focusing on how the Pow class and its methods handle the evaluation and simplification of such expressions.\n\nThe relevant code spans that address the issue are:\n\n1. In sympy/core/power.py, the Pow class and its methods such as _eval_power, _eval_is_positive, _eval_is_negative, and _eval_is_zero can be relevant as they deal with the properties and evaluations of powers, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n2. In sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, the powsimp function is relevant as it handles the simplification of powers, which is the main action involved in the reported issue.\n\n3. In sympy/assumptions/handlers/order.py, the AskNegativeHandler and AskNonNegativeHandler classes are relevant as they handle the assumptions about whether a given expression is negative or non-negative, which can affect how simplifications are performed.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can understand how the simplification of expressions involving powers of negative bases is currently handled in SymPy and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and identification of relevant code spans, the task of identifying relevant code spans for the reported issue is complete with the provided search results.",
