The `Pow` class and its methods in `sympy/core/power.py` are likely to be relevant, especially `_eval_power` and `_eval_subs`. Additionally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is another key component. The `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` could also play a role in the inconsistency observed. Given the similarity of the results when substituting specific values for `x`, the problem might lie in how the simplification handles symbolic versus numeric values. Therefore, focusing on these files and functions can help pinpoint the source of the inconsistency.",

The primary focus seems to be on understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of the 'Pow' class and the 'simplify' function in the sympy library to handle these cases more consistently.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant code spans were found:\n\n1. `sympy/core/power.py` - This file contains the 'Pow' class which is central to handling powers. Relevant spans include 'Pow.base', 'Pow.exp', 'Pow._eval_power', and 'Pow._eval_is_zero'. These spans are directly related to properties of the 'Pow' class and its evaluation methods.\n\n2. `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` - Contains 'refine_Pow' which is likely involved in refining the expression involving powers. This is relevant to the reported issue as it could potentially handle the simplification steps.\n\n3. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - This file contains the 'simplify' function, which is called in the example given in the reported issue.
