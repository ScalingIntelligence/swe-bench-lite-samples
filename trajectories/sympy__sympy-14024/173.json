The inconsistency arises when simplifying with a as a positive integer or a general symbol with properties like 'integer' and 'positive'. The search results provide several relevant functions and methods that might be causing this issue. The `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` appears to handle specialized refining of powers, which could potentially be involved in the simplification process. Similarly, the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is designed to simplify powers, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` is critical as it defines how powers should be evaluated, potentially leading to the inconsistency observed. The `_eval_power` methods in the `sign` and `Abs` classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` might also play a role in handling the specific cases of negative bases and absolute values, which are pertinent to the reported issue.",
