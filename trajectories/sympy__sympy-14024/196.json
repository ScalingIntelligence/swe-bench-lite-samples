The problem seems to be centered around the handling of powers, particularly with negative bases and fractional exponents. Relevant files and methods to investigate include those related to power evaluation, simplification, and assumptions about the properties of numbers (real, positive, etc.). Specifically, the files `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` are likely to contain the methods involved in power evaluation and simplification. Focusing on the methods `_eval_power`, `simplify`, and related assumption handlers can help identify the source of the inconsistency.",

The main focus is on how the expression behaves under simplification and substitution, particularly in relation to powers and negative values. Several key pieces of code are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. The `Float._eval_power` and `Rational._eval_power` methods from `sympy/core/numbers.py` handle the exponentiation of `Float` and `Rational` types, which are crucial for understanding how individual components of the expression are computed.\n\n2. The `Pow` class and its methods such as `_eval_is_negative` and `_eval_power` from `sympy/core/power.py` are essential as they define the behavior of the `Pow` object, including how it evaluates whether it is negative and how it handles exponentiation.\n\n3. The `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions from `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` are directly related to simplifying expressions involving powers, which is a central part of the reported issue.\n\n4. The `AskNegativeHandler.Pow` and `AskNonNegativeHandler.Pow` methods from `sympy/assumptions/handlers/order.py` deal with assumptions about whether a power expression is negative or non-negative, which is relevant for understanding how SymPy evaluates these expressions under certain assumptions.\n\n5. The `AskRealHandler.Pow` and `AskImaginaryHandler.Pow` methods from `sympy/assumptions/handlers/sets.py` handle assumptions about whether a power expression is real or imaginary, which is also relevant given the nature of the reported issue.\n\nThese code spans collectively provide the necessary context and functionality to address the reported issue regarding the simplification and evaluation of power expressions in SymPy.",
