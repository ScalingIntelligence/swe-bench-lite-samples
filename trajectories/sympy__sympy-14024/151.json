The observed behaviors differ in these cases, indicating a potential problem with how symbolic and concrete values are handled in the simplification process. To debug this, we need to focus on the Pow class and its related methods in 'sympy/core/power.py', especially '_eval_power' and '_eval_is_positive'. We should also look into the handling of powers and simplification in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' and 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py'.",

The relevant code spans should cover the Pow class methods, especially those involved in evaluating and simplifying powers, as well as the powsimp function which is directly responsible for simplifying powers. The _eval_refine and refine_Pow methods are also critical as they handle refining the expression based on assumptions. Given these points, the relevant spans from the search results are those that define and manipulate Pow objects or involve the powsimp function. The search task is not yet complete as the search results should ideally cover the entire implementations of the Pow class, specifically the _eval_refine method for handling refinements, and possibly more detailed handling of powsimp especially to see how it manages the specific case mentioned in the issue.
