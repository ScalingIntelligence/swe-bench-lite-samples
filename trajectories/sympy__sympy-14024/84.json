The relevant files appear to be those that handle expressions involving powers, such as 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', and 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py'. It's also important to check how symbolic variables and constants are handled in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' and how expansions and simplifications are performed in 'sympy/core/mul.py' and 'sympy/core/add.py'.
