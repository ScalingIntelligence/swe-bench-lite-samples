            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves inconsistencies in handling the simplification of the expression $(-a)^x * a^(-x)$ when $a$ is a positive integer. The issue is traced to the simplification of powers and the handling of negative bases in `sympy`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the identified code spans relate to the issue:\n\n1. **`sympy/core/power.py` - `Pow._eval_power`**\n   This method handles the evaluation of power expressions. It contains logic for handling various cases, including when the exponent is an integer, when the base is polar, and when the exponent is a symbol with predefined properties (even, odd, real, imaginary). This is a crucial part of handling powers correctly, which is at the core of the reported issue.\n\n2. **`sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - `powsimp`**\n   This function simplifies powers with the same base or exponent. It is responsible for combining terms and potentially resolving inconsistencies in the simplification logic for powers. The issue might involve not correctly simplifying or distributing power terms, which is relevant here.\n\n3. **`sympy/assumptions/handlers/order.py` - Handlers for AskNegative, AskNonNegative**\n   The assumptions handlers help determine the properties of expressions like whether they're negative or non-negative, which is important for simplifying powers. The handlers for such questions are relevant as the original issue involves trignometric implications.\n\n4. **`sympy/core/mul.py` - `Mul._eval_power`**\n   Similar to `Pow._eval_power`, this method handles powers specifically within the context of multiplication operations, which are crucial for simplifying composite expressions like $(-a)^x * a^(-x)$.\n\n5. **`sympy/assumptions/handlers/sets.py` - AskReal, AskImaginary Handlers**\n   These handlers are relevant for determining whether parts of the expression are real or imaginary, which again is crucial for simplification logic. Especially relevant are the handlers for complex and imaginary behaviors related to powers.\n\n6. **`sympy/core/numbers.py` - Power evaluation methods in Number classes (Float, Rational, Integer, etc.)**\n   These methods handle exponentiation for basic number types, and inconsistencies here could directly lead to the issues seen in expressions that simplify down to such basic forms.\n\n7. **`sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - `posify`**\n   This function is used in simplifying expressions and deals with transforming symbols and ensuring positivity where possible, which is crucial in the context of the negative bases in $(-a)^x$.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I would select the spans that are directly involved in handling the evaluation and simplification of power expressions. These are the primary suspects for addressing the reported inconsistency issue concerning negative bases being simplified.\n",
