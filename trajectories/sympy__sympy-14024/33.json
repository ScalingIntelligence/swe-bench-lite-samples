The inconsistency arises when 'a' is a symbol versus when 'a' is a specific number like 2. This suggests a possible bug in the simplification logic, particularly when handling negative bases and exponents.\n\nReviewing the file context, it seems relevant spans include those from 'powsimp', 'Pow', 'Mul', and their respective methods for handling powers and multiplications. The focus should be on methods like '_eval_power' in 'Pow', 'powsimp' in 'powsimp', and '_eval_subs' in 'Mul', as these involve calculations and simplifications concerning powers and substitutions that might be responsible for the inconsistency observed.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it's reasonable to target 'powsimp' first, as it is directly responsible for simplifying expressions involving powers. Within 'powsimp', particularly relevant are the logic and conditions under 'combine', especially how expressions like (-a)**x * a**(-x) are handled. There might be a discrepancy when dealing with symbolic 'a' vs numeric 'a', possibly influenced by assumptions or specific handling of the base 'a'.\n\nReproducing the issue structure in the reported inconsistency using the exact expressions and comparing outputs for symbolic 'a' and numeric 'a' should highlight the divergence in simplification results. Corrective measures may involve addressing assumptions or conditions affecting 'combine' operations in 'powsimp', or adjusting how specific cases like negative bases are processed in method '_eval_power' of class 'Pow'.",
