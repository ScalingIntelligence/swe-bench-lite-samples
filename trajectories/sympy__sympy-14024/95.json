The expressions are simplified differently based on whether the base is symbolic (e.g., 'a') or a specific number (e.g., '2'). We need to investigate the functions and methods involved in power evaluation, simplification, and substitution to understand why these inconsistencies occur. Looking into the relevant classes and methods in 'power.py', 'numbers.py', and 'simplify/simplify.py', as well as handlers in 'assumptions/' could provide insights.",

The user provided examples of these inconsistencies where the results differ depending on whether `a` is a symbolic positive integer or a specific integer (e.g., 2). The core issue seems to be related to how exponentials and powers are handled, especially when dealing with negative bases and fractional exponents. The search results contain relevant code spans from various parts of the SymPy codebase that deal with exponential and power operations, including the `Pow` class and its `_eval_power` method, as well as methods for handling specific number types like `Integer`, `Rational`, and `Float`. These code spans are crucial for understanding how powers and exponentials are evaluated and simplified in SymPy. Additionally, the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions from `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` suggest that these simplification routines might also play a role in the reported issue.",
