The inconsistency arises when comparing the simplified and unsimplified forms of the expression with different values of 'a' and 'x'. 2. Reviewing the current file context: There are no previously identified relevant files or code spans. 3. Processing new search results: a. Analyzing the code spans in sympy/core/power.py: The spans 'Pow', 'Pow.base', 'Pow.exp', 'Pow._eval_power', and 'Pow._eval_is_negative' deal with power operations and properties of the base and exponent. These are highly relevant. b. Analyzing the code spans in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py: The spans 'powsimp', 'powdenest', and '_denest_pow' address power simplifications, which are directly related to the issue. c. Analyzing the code spans in sympy/assumptions/refine.py: The span 'refine_Pow' deals with refining power expressions based on assumptions, which could potentially be relevant. d. Analyzing the code spans in sympy/core/numbers.py: The spans 'Float._eval_power', 'Rational._eval_power', and 'Integer._eval_power' are related to number types and their power operations, which are relevant. e. Analyzing the code spans in sympy/simplify/simplify.py: The span 'simplify' is the main function for simplifying expressions, which is relevant. f. Analyzing the code spans in sympy/assumptions/sathandlers.py and other files: These spans deal with assumptions and handling of specific cases which, while not directly related to the issue, could influence the simplification process. 4. Deciding on relevance and completeness: The identified spans in sympy/core/power.py, sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, sympy/assumptions/refine.py, sympy/core/numbers.py, and sympy/simplify/simplify.py are relevant to the issue. The search for relevant code can be considered complete as the identified code spans cover the core functionality needed to address the issue of simplifying power expressions, particularly with negative bases and integer exponents.",
