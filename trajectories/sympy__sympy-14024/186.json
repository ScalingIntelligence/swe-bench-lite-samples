The user provided examples showing different results based on whether a is a symbolic positive integer or a specific positive integer like 2. This discrepancy is likely rooted in how powers and logarithms are handled within the simplification process. To address this, it's crucial to examine the code responsible for power handling and simplification. This includes the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py', which has methods for evaluating powers and handling special cases like when the base is negative. Additionally, the 'powsimp' and 'simplify' functions in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' respectively are key, as they are responsible for combining and simplifying powers, which could be where these inconsistencies arise.
