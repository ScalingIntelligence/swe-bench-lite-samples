            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves inconsistencies in the simplification of expressions involving negative bases raised to powers and their subsequent multiplication with the same base raised to a negative power. The expected outcome is that the simplified expression should match the numerical evaluation, but this is not the case when the base is a specific integer. The search results include code spans from three files: `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`. Each file contains potentially relevant code spans that address power operations, simplification, and assumptions on expressions. Here's the analysis for each file:\n\n1. `sympy/core/power.py` - This file contains the `Pow` class which defines power operations. The `_eval_power` method is particularly relevant as it evaluates powers based on certain conditions and handles special cases like negative bases and non-integer exponents.\n\n2. `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - This file contains functions for simplifying powers such as `powsimp` and `powdenest`. The `powsimp` function aims to combine powers with the same base or exponent, which could be relevant to the reported issue as it involves combining terms with the same base but different exponents caused by the negative sign.\n\n3. `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` - This file contains refinement rules for expressions based on assumptions. The `refine_Pow` function applies specific rules to refine `Pow` expressions, considering assumptions about the base and exponent's properties (e.g., real, even, odd), which could help handle the inconsistency in simplifying expressions with negative bases.\n\nGiven these analyses, the identified relevant code spans are within the `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py`, the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and the `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`.",
