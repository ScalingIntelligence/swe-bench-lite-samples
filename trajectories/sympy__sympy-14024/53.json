The problem seems to be related to how the simplification handles different values of 'a' (a positive integer) and different values of 'x'. The relevant code spans should include functions and methods responsible for power evaluations, simplification of powers, and handling of complex numbers. Specifically, the '_eval_power' methods in the 'Pow', 'Integer', 'Rational', 'Float', 'NegativeOne', 'ImaginaryUnit' classes are likely to be involved, as well as the 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' functions in the 'powsimp.py' file. The 'refine_Pow' function in 'refine.py' might also be relevant for understanding the assumptions during simplification. The 'isqrt' function in 'power.py' might be related as well, although less directly.",

The relevant sections are likely to include definitions and methods for handling powers, exponential functions, and their properties, as well as any special handling for negative bases and their powers.\n\nTo address the issue, the analysis should focus on the `Pow` class and its methods, especially those related to exponentiation and simplification (`_eval_power`, `_eval_is_negative`, `_eval_is_zero`, etc.), as well as the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in the `powsimp.py` file, which handle the simplification of expressions involving powers. These methods and functions will help in understanding how expressions involving negative bases and complex exponents are treated during simplification.\n\nThe analysis will also look into the `exponential` function in the `exponential.py` file, which might contain specific rules or methods related to exponential functions, though the current search results do not include this file directly.
