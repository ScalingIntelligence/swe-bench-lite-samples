The user is attempting to compare the results of simplification for expressions like (-a)^x * a^(-x) under different conditions, and there is a noted inconsistency between the outcomes. The key elements involved in this issue are the handling of negative bases in powers, the simplification logic for such expressions, and the evaluation of these expressions with specific values.\n\nExamining the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans that deal with the evaluation and simplification of power expressions in the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py`. Specifically, the methods `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_multinomial` within the `Pow` class are directly related to how powers are evaluated and simplified, which is central to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `_eval_power` method in `sympy/core/numbers.py` for specific number types like `Float`, `Rational`, `NegativeOne`, `Infinity`, and `NegativeInfinity` also provides context for how powers are handled for these numerical types, which may be relevant when substituting numerical values into the symbolic expressions.\n\nHowever, after reviewing all the provided code spans, there doesn't appear to be a direct reference to the specific inconsistency highlighted in the issue regarding the simplification of expressions involving negative bases and their power.\n\nDespite identifying relevant sections of the codebase that manage power evaluations and simplifications, the search results do not provide a direct solution or clear evidence of where the inconsistency is handled or might be addressed. Therefore, while the identified code spans are pertinent to the issue, they do not fully resolve the issue as reported.",
