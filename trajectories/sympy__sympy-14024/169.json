To address this, it's necessary to inspect the handling of such expressions in the '_eval_power' method within classes like Pow, Integer, and Rational, and also in the 'refine_Pow' and 'powsimp' functions. Additional scrutiny might be needed in the 'simplify' function itself, as well as the assumption handlers for real and imaginary numbers.",

The main focus is on the simplify function's behavior with specific examples involving real and complex numbers. We need to identify code spans that deal with power evaluations, especially where the base is negative or involves complex numbers, and where the simplify function is implemented or invoked. The provided search results include various sympy modules such as 'sympy.core.numbers', 'sympy.core.power', 'sympy.simplify.powsimp', 'sympy.core.mul', 'sympy.core.add', and 'sympy.simplify.simplify'. These modules contain methods like '_eval_power' for different classes (Float, Rational, Integer, NegativeOne, Infinity), and functions like 'powsimp' and 'simplify'. These are likely relevant as they handle the evaluation and simplification of powers, which is central to the issue. Additionally, the 'sympy.assumptions.handlers.sets' module could be relevant for understanding how assumptions about the types of numbers (real, imaginary) affect the simplification process.",
