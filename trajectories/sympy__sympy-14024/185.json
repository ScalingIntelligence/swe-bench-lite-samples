The problem seems to be related to how the `simplify` function and power evaluation handle these expressions, particularly when `a` is a positive integer. It is necessary to investigate the relevant methods in the classes `Pow`, `Mul`, `Add`, and others that handle power evaluations and simplifications. These methods likely reside in `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, and similar files. Focus should be on the `_eval_power` methods and simplification logic.",
