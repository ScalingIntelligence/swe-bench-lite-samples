This involves the manipulation and evaluation of power expressions, which are typically handled by classes like Pow in sympy/core/power.py. Additionally, simplification might involve functions from sympy/simplify/simplify.py and sympy/simplify/powsimp.py. Given the specific example using 'a' as a positive integer and the inconsistencies observed when substituting different values for 'x', it's important to investigate how Pow handles such cases and how simplifications are applied.",
