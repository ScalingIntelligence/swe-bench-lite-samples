Comparing two cases, the issue seems to be with the handling of the base and exponent in the simplification process, particularly when the base is negative and the exponent is fractional. The code spans provided from Pow and powsimp in sympy/core/power.py and sympy/simplify/powsimp.py respectively, offer a significant focus on the power-related evaluations and simplifications. These parts of the code, including Pow._eval_power and powsimp function, are crucial for understanding how power expressions are being simplified according to SymPy's rules, which directly aligns with the reported issue. As a result, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the issue at hand. Additionally, the refine_Pow function in sympy/assumptions/refine.py also checks for conditions under which a power expression may be simplified, which adds to the context of understanding the simplification logic.",
