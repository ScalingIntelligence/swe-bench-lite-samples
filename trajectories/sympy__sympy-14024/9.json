Key code spans to review are those related to simplification, power evaluation, and handling of expressions involving powers and symbols. The analysis should focus on how the `simplify` function and the `_eval_power` methods of various classes handle such expressions. Specifically, attention should be given to how negative bases and rational exponents are managed, as these are critical for addressing the inconsistency. The provided code spans include `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` for the main simplification logic, `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py` which show how expressions and numbers evaluate powers. These sections also demonstrate the handling of specific cases like negative numbers and rational exponents which are directly relevant to the reported issue. In particular, the `_eval_power` implementations in `sympy/core/mul.py` and `sympy/core/power.py` are crucial for understanding how powers involving negative bases and rational exponents are processed. The code spans in `sympy/core/numbers.py` related to `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, and `NegativeOne` provide insight into definite implementations of power evaluations for these specific numeric types.",
