The issue involves simplification of powers and their behavior under different conditions. I then examined the provided code spans in different files to find methods and classes related to power evaluation and simplification. I identified files (`sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`) containing relevant methods such as `_eval_power` which are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue. These methods deal directly with the evaluation and simplification of powers, especially considering the base and exponent properties. Additionally, I looked for other relevant methods like `_eval_is_real`, `_eval_is_positive`, etc., which assist in determining the properties of these expressions, potentially impacting their simplification. Based on these analyses, I chose the following code spans as relevant to the reported issue:\n- `Float._eval_power` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n- `Rational._eval_power` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n- `Integer._eval_power` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n- `NegativeOne._eval_power` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n- `Pow._eval_power` in `sympy/core/power.py`\n- `Pow._eval_is_positive` in `sympy/core/power.py`\n- `Pow._eval_is_negative` in `sympy/core/power.py`\nThese spans cover the core functionality of handling powers and their properties in the context of the reported inconsistency.",
