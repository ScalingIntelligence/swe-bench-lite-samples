The inconsistency observed is due to differences in how the base values are treated, especially when a is symbolic versus when it's a specific integer. Focusing on the core operations and simplification logic in the sympy library is crucial. Searching within files that deal with powering operations, simplification functions, and handling of symbolic and numeric bases will likely provide insights. The problem might be rooted in the _eval_power method, particularly how it handles negative bases and exponents. Specific methods such as powsimp and refine_Pow could also be relevant, as they explicitly deal with power simplification. Additionally, checking the assumptions handler for how it treats negative and non-negative numbers in power expressions could provide more context.",

The relevant code spans are identified by examining the Pow class's _eval_power method, which handles exponentiation, and the powsimp and powdenest functions in the simplify module, which are responsible for simplifying powers. The _eval_power method in the Pow class seems particularly important as it contains logic for handling different types of bases and exponents, which could explain the observed inconsistency.

For symbolic bases, it ensures consistency in handling negatives by potentially adjusting the base and exponent relationships. The `powsimp` function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' demonstrates how expressions are simplified, particularly focusing on combining bases with the same exponents or vice versa.
