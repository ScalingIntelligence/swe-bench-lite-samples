The `Pow._eval_power` method is of particular interest as it contains logic for evaluating powers, including handling of complex values and real exponents. Similarly, the `powsimp` function in `powsimp.py` could be relevant as it deals with simplifying expressions involving powers. The `Expr._eval_power` method in `expr.py` is also relevant as it provides a base implementation for evaluating powers.
