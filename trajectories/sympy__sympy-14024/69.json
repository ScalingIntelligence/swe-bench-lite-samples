The key focus is on the behavior of the `simplify` function, which should ideally simplify the expression to (-1)**x consistently. The provided examples show that the simplification works differently when 'a' is a Symbol with specific properties versus when 'a' is a specific integer (2). This suggests an issue in the handling of these expressions within the `Pow` and `powsimp` functions in the `sympy` library. The search results include code spans from `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and `sympy/core/expr.py`. These files are relevant because they contain implementations and evaluations of power functions, which are central to the reported issue. The `Pow._eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py` is particularly relevant as it handles the evaluation of power expressions, which is a key part of the simplification process. Similarly, the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is directly involved in simplifying power expressions and should be examined for inconsistencies in handling the base and exponent as described in the issue. Relevant code spans include the handling of integer exponents and the simplification logic within these functions.",

The new search results revisit sympy/core/power.py, sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, and sympy/core/expr.py to potentially identify additional relevant code spans for simplifying the expression. After analyzing the code spans in both the context and the search results, the identified code spans relevant to the reported issue involve handling and simplification of powers, particularly in the classes Pow and Expr, and the function powsimp. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the evaluation of powers, simplification of expressions involving powers, and the handling of commutative and non-commutative parts of the product. Key highlights include the _eval_power method in the Pow class, the powsimp function, and the _eval_power method in the Expr class.
