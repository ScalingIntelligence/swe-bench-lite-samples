The issue involves expressions of the form (-a)**x * a**(-x) where 'a' is a positive integer, and it seems to compare how this expression simplifies under different conditions. By examining the provided search results, we can identify several key sections in the code, particularly in the 'sympy/core/power.py' and 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' files, which define the behavior of the Pow class and the powsimp function. These sections are crucial as they deal with the evaluation, simplification, and properties of powers, which are directly related to the reported issue. The spans identified include various methods within the Pow class that handle evaluations (like _eval_power, _eval_derivative, _eval_evalf), properties (like base, exp), and substitions (like _eval_subs) of powers, as well as the powsimp function that is responsible for simplifying expressions involving powers.
