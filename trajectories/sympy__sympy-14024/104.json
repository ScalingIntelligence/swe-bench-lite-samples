This particular expression arises from handling powers of negative numbers and involves ensuring the simplification process maintains mathematical correctness across different scenarios. The key elements identified in the issue are the functions `Pow`, `simplify`, and the handling of negative bases and exponents in SymPy's core power module (`sympy/core/power.py`) and simplify module (`sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`). Also relevant is the refinement of power expressions in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, and the function `sign` for handling complex expressions in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`. Each code span is examined to see how it might influence or be part of the solution to the reported issue. Specifically, `Pow._eval_power` in `sympy/core/power.py` deals with the evaluation of powers, which is central to the issue. Similarly, `powsimp` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is the function intended to simplify such expressions, making it highly relevant. The `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` refines power expressions based on assumptions, likely playing a part in addressing the issue's inconsistencies. Lastly, `sign` and its methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` are checked for how they handle signs in complex expressions, which is relevant to correctly simplifying expressions involving negative bases.",
