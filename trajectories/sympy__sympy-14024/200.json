The problem manifests differently when `a` is a symbol compared to when it is a specific integer (like 2). Given the provided file contexts, it is evident that the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` is central to handling power operations. Additionally, simplification functions like `simplify` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` might be involved. The `_eval_power` methods across various classes (like in `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`) also play a crucial role. Initial search should focus on these files, particularly around the `_eval_power` methods and simplification functions.",

The `Pow` class in sympy/core/power.py, which includes methods like `_eval_refine`, `_eval_is_negative`, and `_eval_is_zero`. These methods deal with properties of powers and could potentially affect how expressions are simplified. \n\n2. Functions in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py such as `powsimp` and `powdenest`, which are explicitly designed for simplifying powers and could play a role in handling the inconsistency. \n\n3. The `Rational` and `Integer` classes in sympy/core/numbers.py, particularly their `_eval_power` methods, which handle exponentiation of these types and might affect the final output when compared with sympy\u2019s built-in results. \n\nGiven these matches, it seems likely that the relevant code spans are included in these search results.",

The `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` includes methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_is_negative`, and `_eval_is_positive`, which manage the evaluation and simplification of power expressions, including checks for the base being negative and the exponent being odd or even. This is exactly the logic needed to address the inconsistency when simplifying expressions involving powers of negative numbers and positive integers.\n\nIn `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Rational` and `Integer` classes also have `_eval_power` methods that handle the simplification of expressions involving rational numbers raised to other rational numbers or integers. These methods are crucial for handling different types of numbers and their exponentiation, which could be tied into the simplification logic for the issue at hand.",
