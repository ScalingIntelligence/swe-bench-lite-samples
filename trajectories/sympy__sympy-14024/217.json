This issue has two main aspects to consider: how the simplification behaves with symbolic expressions and how it behaves with specific numerical values. The search results contain several relevant files and code spans, particularly those dealing with power simplification and handling properties like negativity and realness in expressions. \n\n1. The file 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' contains the 'powsimp' function, which is the main function for simplifying expressions with powers. This function is likely to be directly involved in the simplification process described in the issue. \n\n2. The file 'sympy/assumptions/handlers/order.py' includes handlers for asking properties like negativity and non-negativity, which are relevant for determining the behavior of powers during simplification. Specifically, the 'AskNegativeHandler' and 'AskNonNegativeHandler' classes handle queries about whether expressions are negative or non-negative, which can influence the simplification process. \n\n3. The file 'sympy/assumptions/handlers/sets.py' contains handlers for asking about the set properties of expressions, such as whether they are real or imaginary. The 'AskRealHandler' and 'AskImaginaryHandler' are particularly relevant, as they determine the properties of expressions that could affect their simplification in the context of the reported issue. \n\n4. The file 'sympy/core/power.py' defines the 'Pow' class, which is fundamental for expressions involving powers. The '_eval_power' method in this class is responsible for evaluating expressions with powers, which is directly related to the issues described in the simplification process. \n\n5. The file 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' contains the 'simplify' function, which is the main entry point for simplification in SymPy. This function orchestrates the simplification process, including calls to specialized simplification functions like 'powsimp', making it central to handling the reported issue. \n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, focusing on these files and code spans will provide a comprehensive understanding and potential resolution of the simplification inconsistencies described.",
