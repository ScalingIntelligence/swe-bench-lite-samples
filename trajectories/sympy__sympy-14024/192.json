Two specific scenarios are presented where the simplification results differ, one with `a` as a symbolic positive integer and the other with `a` as a specific integer value (`S(2)`). The analysis of the code spans provided reveals that `sympy/core/power.py` contains the `Pow` class with methods relevant to exponentiation evaluation, including `_eval_power` which handles exponentiation rules. Additionally, `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` have functions (`refine_Pow` and `powsimp` respectively) that could influence how powers are simplified based on assumptions and common exponent simplifications.",
