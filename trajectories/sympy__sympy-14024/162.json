The key elements to focus on are the handling of negative bases, the integer and positive nature of a, and how the exponentiation and simplification are implemented. The search results provide several relevant code spans in `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`. In `power.py`, the class `Pow` and its methods are particularly relevant, especially `_eval_refine`, `_eval_power`, and `_eval_expand_power_base`. These methods deal with how powers are evaluated, simplified, and expanded, which directly relates to the reported issue. In `powsimp.py`, the function `powsimp` and `powdenest` are relevant as they are responsible for simplifying and denesting powers, respectively. These functions are likely to be used or extended to address the reported issue.
