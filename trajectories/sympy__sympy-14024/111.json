The inconsistency arises when 'a' is a positive integer and the simplification does not yield consistent results for different values of 'a'. The key elements to look for in the code are handling of powers, especially when dealing with negative bases and their simplification routines.  \n\nThe provided search results include significant sections of the code related to power simplification, specifically in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. The spans labeled 'simplify' and 'Simplify' contain the main logic for the simplify function, which processes an expression to simplify it by applying various simplification techniques. This includes handling of powers and logarithms, which are directly related to the reported issue. Furthermore, the 'powsimp' span indicates that it is responsible for handling the simplification of powers, which is central to the issue at hand. The 'hypersimp' and 'signsimp' spans, though not directly related to powers, may indirectly provide context on simplification strategies that could impact the issue at hand.\n\nGiven that the current file context already provides comprehensive code spans from `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py` that deal with the core logic of power evaluation and simplification, these new spans from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` further enrich the understanding of the simplification process. They hint at broader strategies for handling and simplifying expressions, potentially leading to a deeper understanding or a solution for the reported inconsistencies in power simplification. Thus, while the current spans are not directly the 'culprits', they offer valuable tools and contexts for addressing such issues.",
