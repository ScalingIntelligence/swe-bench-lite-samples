The key steps include analyzing the behavior of the `Pow` class, specifically the methods related to evaluation, simplification, and handling of negative bases and exponents. The search results provide sections of code from `Pow` class methods such as `_eval_power`, `_eval_refine`, and `_eval_expand_power_base`, which are likely relevant for understanding the simplification logic. Additionally, the `refine_Pow` function from `sympy.assumptions.refine` and the `powsimp` function from `sympy.simplify.powsimp` are also relevant as they deal with simplifying power expressions under different assumptions and combining bases or exponents, respectively.
