The provided search results contain code spans that deal with power evaluation and simplification, which are directly relevant to the issue. In sympy/core/power.py, the span 'Pow._eval_power' contains methods for handling the evaluation of powers, including special cases for negative bases and real exponents. This is highly relevant as it directly addresses the core issue of inconsistency in power simplification. Similarly, in sympy/assumptions/refine.py, the span 'refine_Pow' deals with refining power expressions based on assumptions, which is also relevant to ensuring consistent simplification. In sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, the span 'powsimp' is dedicated to simplifying expressions involving powers, which directly aligns with the goal of ensuring consistent simplification across different inputs. Given the detailed analysis of the code spans, it is evident that these spans are highly relevant to resolving the reported issue.",

The key issue seems to revolve around how the simplification routine handles the base and exponent in these different contexts. The file_context provided initially pointed to `sympy/core/power.py`, specifically the `Pow._eval_power` method and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` with the `refine_Pow` function that might contribute to this inconsistency. The new search results reaffirm these contexts and do not introduce new code spans significant to the issue reported. The analysis of the updated search results, particularly in `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, suggests that the relevance of the initially identified code spans stands; the new information does not add an extra step or reveal an overlooked aspect critical to resolving the reported issue. This maintains the assumption that the code already identified is pertinent to resolving the inconsistency described. Given the consistent relevance of the initially marked code spans to the reported issue, and no additional, essential code spans in the new search results contributing further, it can be concluded that the task of identifying relevant code spans is complete.",
