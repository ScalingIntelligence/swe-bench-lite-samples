The main goal is to ensure that the result of such simplification is consistent regardless of whether 'a' is symbolic or a concrete integer. The problem lies in the handling of the base and the exponent in the `_eval_power` and `powsimp` methods. The current implementation does not consistently handle the simplification when the base is negative and the exponent is symbolic. We need to update these methods to ensure that the simplification is applied correctly in all cases.",
