The key to addressing this issue is to understand how the Pow class in sympy.core.power handles such expressions and how the simplify function in sympy.simplify.simplify resolves them. Furthermore, understanding the assumptions handlers in sympy.assumptions.handlers.order is crucial for determining the sign of the expressions.\n\nAnalyzing the <search_results>, we find:\n- The Pow class in sympy/core/power.py contains methods like _eval_is_negative, _eval_is_zero, _eval_subs, and _eval_derivative that are relevant to understanding how powers are evaluated and simplified.\n- The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is directly involved in the simplification of expressions, and understanding its logic is crucial for resolving the reported issue.\n- The AskNegativeHandler, AskNonNegativeHandler, and AskPositiveHandler in sympy/assumptions/handlers/order.py are critical for handling the assumptions about the expression's sign, which is important for the correctness of the simplification.\n\nBased on the analysis of the search results, the identified spans within the Pow class, the simplify function, and the assumption handlers are all relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
