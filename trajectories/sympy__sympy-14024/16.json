The inconsistency arises when the base 'a' is a positive integer and the exponent 'x' is substituted with a complex number (such as -10/3). This suggests that the problem might be in how the simplification of such powers is handled in the code.

There is an inconsistency depending on whether `a` is a symbol or a specific number (e.g., 2). Additionally, the reference implementation provided suggests the expected result should be `(-1)**x`.\n\nGiven the search results, there are several relevant code spans identified:\n\n1. In `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `powsimp` function is responsible for simplifying powers. It includes logic to combine bases and exponents, which is directly related to the issue reported. This function could impact how `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` is simplified.\n\n2. Also in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `powdenest` function attempts to denest powers, which could also play a role in simplifying the given expression.\n\n3. In `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, the `refine_Pow` function is used to refine the properties of powers based on assumptions. This could help understand the behavior of `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` under different assumptions about `a` and `x`.\n\n4. Finally, in `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow._eval_power` method contains logic for evaluating powers. This method includes specific handling for integer and real exponents, which is crucial for understanding how `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` might be evaluated.\n\nThese code spans collectively cover the key functionalities involved in simplifying and evaluating expressions of the form `(-a)**x * a**(-x)`.",
