The focus should be on the `simplify` function and how it handles power expressions, especially when the base is negative. Relevant files likely include those handling power operations, simplification, and assumptions. Given the provided context, specific attention should be given to `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, as these contain methods directly related to power evaluation and simplification. Additionally, investigate the `_eval_power` method within `sympy/core/mul.py` and `sympy/core/add.py`, as these might influence how powers are handled in expressions.",

The examples provided show different outcomes for symbolic and numerical values of 'a'. We should focus on code spans related to Pow, simplify, and refine functions, as these operations are central to the issue. The spans related to '_eval_power', 'simplify', and 'refine_Pow' seem particularly relevant as they deal directly with the evaluation and simplification of powers. Additionally, '_denest_pow' and 'powdenest' functions could be relevant if they handle the nesting of powers in a way that affects the simplification. Analyzing these sections will help us understand how powers are being processed and simplified, and whether there are any discrepancies or edge cases that need to be addressed. By examining these sections, we can determine if the identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue or if more investigation is needed.",
