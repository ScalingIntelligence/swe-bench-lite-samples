The inconsistency arises from the difference in results when 'a' is a symbolic positive integer versus when 'a' is a specific positive integer (e.g., 2).

This has been tested with both symbolic 'a' and specific integer values 'a'. The primary focus is on the simplification process and how it affects the results when substituting specific values for 'x'. The relevant code spans should focus on the implementation of the Pow class, its properties and methods, as well as the refine_Pow function and the powsimp function. Additionally, understanding how the sign function behaves under certain conditions is crucial, especially with complex numbers. The most relevant parts of the codebase appear to be the _eval_refine, _eval_subs, and _eval_is_negative methods within the Pow class, the refine_Pow function in sympy/assumptions/refine.py, and the powsimp function in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py. These sections handle the simplification, substitution, and evaluation logic that is directly related to the issue at hand. Furthermore, the sign function's behavior, particularly its evaluation and power methods, will play a key role in understanding the inconsistencies noted in the example outputs.",

Specifically, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` contains methods for evaluating and simplifying powers, including `_eval_refine` and `_eval_subs` which are crucial for handling symbolic substitutions and simplifications. The `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` is also relevant as it refines expressions based on assumptions, which can be used to simplify the powers involved in the reported issue. Additionally, the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is designed to simplify expressions involving powers by combining them in various ways, which directly addresses the issue of combining powers like those in the reported issue. Finally, the `sign` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` is used to determine the sign of expressions, which is relevant for the simplification of expressions involving powers and signs. All these components together provide a comprehensive set of tools and methods that are relevant to addressing the reported issue, indicating that the provided file context is complete for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",
