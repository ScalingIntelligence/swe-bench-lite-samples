            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves inconsistencies in the simplification of expressions involving powers, specifically focusing on the expression (-a)**x * a**(-x) where 'a' is a positive integer. This issue seems to involve different handling of the base 'a' when it is a symbolic variable versus a specific integer value (like 2). The core functionality for handling power operations, including simplification and evaluation, seems to be spread across multiple files, notably 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/core/numbers.py', 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', and 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py'. To address this problem, it is crucial to examine the '_eval_power' method and the 'simplify' function in these files to understand how different bases and exponents are managed.",
