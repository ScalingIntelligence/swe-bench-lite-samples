The focus should be on the core power and simplification logic in the 'sympy' library to identify where the inconsistency arises. Potential files involved would be those dealing with power operations, simplification, and assumptions handling, such as 'Pow' in 'sympy/core/power.py', 'simplify_Pow' in 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py', and 'powsimp' in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py'. Additionally, functions dealing with numeric evaluations like those in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' might also be relevant. The search should concentrate on these areas to pinpoint the discrepancy.",

Upon reviewing the provided search results, several relevant code spans can be identified. These include methods from the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py' that deal with the evaluation of power expressions, such as '_eval_power', '_eval_refine', and '_eval_expand_power_base'. Additionally, the 'refine_Pow' function in 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py' is relevant for refining expressions involving powers based on assumptions. The 'powsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' also appears relevant for simplifying power expressions. Lastly, the '_eval_power' methods in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' for various number types like 'Float', 'Rational', 'Integer', and 'NegativeOne' are also pertinent as they handle power operations specifically for those types. These identified code spans should provide a good starting point for addressing the reported issue.",
