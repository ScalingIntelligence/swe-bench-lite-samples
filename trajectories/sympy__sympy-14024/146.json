The example provided shows different outcomes when a is a symbolic positive integer versus when a is a specific integer (2). The main concern is to identify the relevant code spans in the sympy library that handle power evaluation and simplification, particularly for expressions involving negative bases and exponents. The search results provide several relevant files (sympy/core/numbers.py, sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, and sympy/core/power.py), each containing methods like _eval_power and powsimp that are responsible for handling powers and their simplifications. The analysis aims to pinpoint the specific code spans that could be responsible for the observed inconsistency in the simplification behavior. It's important to note the handling of negative bases, especially with symbolic values versus specific integers, and how these might affect the evaluation and simplification processes. The identified code spans will be those that define or manipulate these behaviors directly.",
