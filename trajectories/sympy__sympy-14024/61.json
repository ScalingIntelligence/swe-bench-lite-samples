            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about an inconsistency when simplifying the expression (-a)**x * a**(-x) for a positive integer. There are two cases presented: one where 'a' is a symbol with properties of being an integer and positive, and another where 'a' is a specific value of 2. The issue is that in the symbolic case, the simplification leads to (-1)**x, which is correct, but in the specific integer case, the simplification leads to the same result which is mathematically incorrect when x is substituted with a specific value. To resolve this issue, we need to identify the parts of the code in SymPy that deal with the simplification of such expressions, specifically focusing on how powers are handled and simplified. This includes the 'Pow' class and the '_eval_power' method which is responsible for evaluating powers, and the 'simplify' function which orchestrates the simplification process.\n\nFrom the search results, we see relevant code spans in 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py'. These files contain definitions for the 'Pow' class, the '_eval_power' method which handles how powers are evaluated, and the 'simplify' function which is central to the simplification process. Additionally, 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' contains relevant code regarding polar handling which might affect how negative values in bases are treated during simplification.\n\nThe issue at hand involves how the simplification is applied to this particular power expression and how certain conditions might not be correctly handled during the simplification process. The identified spans in the 'Pow' class and its methods ('_eval_power', 'base', 'exp') are directly relevant to understanding how such expressions are processed. The 'simplify' function looks at how expressions are passed through the simplification process, affecting final results directly. The 'powsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' named as 'powsimp' specifically deals with simplification of powers, which is crucial for our issue. Thus, these are the critical sections of the code to understand and potentially modify to address the issue.",
