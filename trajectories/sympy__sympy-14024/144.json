The examples provided show differing results derived from symbol 'a' as a general positive integer versus a specific integer value (2). This suggests that the discrepancy could arise from the specific handling of symbol properties and their evaluations in the context of power operations. To investigate, focus should be on the power evaluation logic within the core power processing classes and functions, particularly where simplifications occur. The search should target the _eval_power method and potentially related simplification functions that manipulate such expressions.",

The key elements to look for in the search results would involve the handling of Pow (power) objects, particularly with respect to negative bases and their exponents. Additionally, the simplification function 'simplify' should be examined for how it processes these cases. From the provided search results, we identify 3 relevant sections from 'sympy/core/power.py' that deal with the evaluation of powers in different scenarios (span id='Pow', span id='Pow._eval_power'), and one section from 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' that details the 'powsimp' function, which is likely involved in the simplification process (span id='powsimp'). These sections are chosen due to their direct relation to the power operations and simplification, which are central to addressing the reported issue. More specifically, the '_eval_power' method within the 'Pow' class handles the evaluation of powers, possibly affecting how negative bases are processed. The 'powsimp' function is also relevant as it deals with simplification of powers. It's important to closely examine these parts of the code to understand if they indeed influence the simplicity behavior in the reported edge case involving negative bases and their powers.",
