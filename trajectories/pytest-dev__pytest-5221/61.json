The current approach involves either looking at the documentation (when available) or reviewing the source code. From the provided files, there are relevant sections in `src/_pytest/python.py` and `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` that need to be investigated further. Specifically, the functions `_show_fixtures_per_test`, `showfixtures`, and `_showfixtures_main` in `src/_pytest/python.py` are likely involved in displaying the fixtures. In `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`, the fixture definition and scope management are defined, particularly around the `fixture` function and the classes that manage fixture requests and scopes. The testing files indicate that there are tests specifically for showing fixtures in different scopes and types, providing a clear direction for the needed enhancement.",
