'show_fixtures_per_test' and '_show_fixtures_per_test' may be relevant if they also handle fixture display for individual tests. \n4. The 'fixture' and 'yield_fixture' functions in 'src/_pytest/fixtures.py' define the fixture decorator and marker, which might contain information on the scope, but are more focused on fixture creation rather than display.\n5. 'write_fixture' and 'write_item' functions in '_show_fixtures_per_test' appear to handle the actual writing of fixture information. \nBy focusing on these spans, we can ensure that all aspects of fixture display, including scope, are captured and used to form a comprehensive response.",
