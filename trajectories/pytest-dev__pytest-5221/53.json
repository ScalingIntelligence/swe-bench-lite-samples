The `src/_pytest/python.py` file contains definitions for `showfixtures` and `_showfixtures_main`, which handle displaying fixtures. The `src/_pytest/setuponly.py` file includes a function `_show_fixture_action` that prints fixture scopes. The `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` file deals with fixture setup and resolution, though not directly related to displaying scopes. The `src/_pytest/setupplan.py` and `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py` files handle command line options and help display, relevant for the `--fixtures` option. Finally, `src/_pytest/main.py` and `src/_pytest/cacheprovider.py` are involved in session management and cache handling, not directly related to fixture display but indicative of pytest's control flow. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these files, a thorough examination is necessary.

The key focus is on enhancing the output of the 'pytest --fixtures' command to include fixture scopes. This involves identifying and possibly modifying functions like 'showfixtures' and related functions in the '_pytest.python' module, as well as ensuring that any display functionality correctly represents the scope of fixtures. From the search results, relevant functions include 'showfixtures', '_showfixtures_main', and 'write_docstring' in '_pytest.python.py', and '_show_fixture_action' in '_pytest.setuponly.py'. These functions are responsible for displaying fixture information, and modifying them to include scope would address the issue. Additionally, the 'pytest_cmdline_main' function in multiple modules ('_pytest.python.py', '_pytest.setuponly.py', '_pytest.setupplan.py', and '_pytest.helpconfig.py') controls the command line options and could be where the '--fixtures' option is handled. Further inspection of these functions will be needed to determine the exact changes required to include fixture scopes in the output.",
