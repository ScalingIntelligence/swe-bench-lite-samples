These functions iterate over available fixtures but do not currently include scope information in their output.\n\nThe new search results include the same files and code spans, indicating that the relevant parts of the codebase for addressing this issue are already identified. The `fixture` function in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` and the associated `FixtureFunctionMarker` class are crucial as they define the fixture and its scope. Additionally, the `showfixtures` and `_showfixtures_main` functions in `src/_pytest/python.py` are responsible for displaying fixture information, where modifications to include scopes would need to be implemented.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, particularly where fixtures are defined and how they are displayed.",
