However, these functions currently do not include the scope attribute of the fixtures in their display logic. The 'FixtureRequest' class in 'fixtures.py' does have a 'scope' attribute that could be leveraged to include the scope information in the display. Since the 'scope' attribute is present in the 'FixtureRequest' class and the display functions need to incorporate this information, the provided context seems relevant but incomplete for fully addressing the issue. The modification of the '_show_fixtures_per_test' and '_showfixtures_main' functions to fetch and display the scope from 'FixtureRequest' objects is required, which indicates an ongoing task but not completion of the full integration.",

From the provided context and search results, it is clear that the files `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` and `src/_pytest/python.py` are relevant. The identified code spans in these files directly relate to the initialization, computation, and manipulation of fixture scopes. Specifically, the `SubRequest.__init__` and `FixtureRequest.__init__` methods initialize the scope attribute, and the `_show_fixtures_per_test` and `_showfixtures_main` functions handle the display of fixtures, which can be extended to include scope information. The presence of these components suggests that the codebase already has substantial infrastructure to support the requested enhancement without requiring a significant rewrite. Further, detailed examination revealed that the `showfixtures` and `show_fixtures_per_test` functions, which are responsible for displaying fixtures, do not currently include scope information, indicating the exact location for integrating the new functionality. Overall, the analysis indicates that the relevant code spans have been identified from the search results, and the integration of scope information into the fixture display can be effectively implemented based on the existing infrastructure.",
