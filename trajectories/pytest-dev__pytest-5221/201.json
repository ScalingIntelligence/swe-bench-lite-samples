This might involve modifications to the 'write_fixture' or 'write_item' functions to ensure that output includes fixture scopes, and a deeper examination of 'show_fixtures_per_test' and '_show_fixtures_per_test' to determine where enhancements are most effective.

The reported issue indicates that current methods to determine fixture scopes involve checking documentation or source code directly. The search results provided include several key files and code spans that pertain to fixture functionality, including `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` and `src/_pytest/setuponly.py`.\n\nIn `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`, the code spans labeled 'get_scope_package', 'FixtureRequest._getscopeitem', 'FixtureFunctionMarker', and 'fixture' are particularly relevant. These spans deal with determining the scope of fixtures, defining fixture scopes, and handling requests related to fixtures. The 'scope' attribute in the 'FixtureFunctionMarker' class is directly related to defining fixture scopes. Additionally, the 'fixture' function allows for the setting of the scope parameter, which is instrumental in demonstrating scopes through the `pytest --fixtures` command.\n\nIn `src/_pytest/setuponly.py`, the 'pytest_fixture_setup' and '_show_fixture_action' spans are relevant as they are involved in setting up fixtures and displaying actions related to them. The '_show_fixture_action' function, in particular, outputs information during fixture setup, which could be adapted to include scope information as requested by the issue.\n\nFinally, in `src/_pytest/hookspec.py`, the 'pytest_fixture_setup' span is part of the hook specifications for pytest, which indicates that modifications here could affect how fixture setup information is handled and potentially shown.\n\nOverall, these spans provide a foundational understanding of how fixture scopes are managed and could be modified or extended to include scope information as part of the output of the `pytest --fixtures` command.",

However, there is no direct mention or display of scope in the functions responsible for showing fixture information. Similarly, in 'src/_pytest/setuponly.py', while there are hooks for setup and teardown of fixtures, they do not currently include scope details in their output. The 'src/_pytest/hookspec.py' file, which defines hook specifications for pytest, also does not currently include scope information in its fixture setup hook specification.

Additionally, reviewing the interaction of these components with 'pytest_cmdline_main' and '_showfixtures_main' may provide insights into the appropriate integration points for displaying fixture scopes.

The current file context already provides a good overview of how fixture definitions are handled, including how their scopes are determined and managed. The new search results broaden the context, showing how fixtures are interacted with during command line executions, including displaying fixture information. However, the primary focus on scopes is not explicitly shown. The `show_fixtures_per_test` function is particularly relevant as it appears to be related to showing fixture details per test, though it lacks implementation. The `pytest_cmdline_main` function in various files shows how the command line interface handles fixture display options. My analysis indicates that the relevant code spans need to include parts of `pytest_cmdline_main`, `showfixtures`, and `_showfixtures_main` from `src/_pytest/python.py` for showing fixture information, but the detailed display of fixture scopes is currently not directly addressed.",
