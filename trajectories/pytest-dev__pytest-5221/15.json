This requires looking into the code that handles the `--fixtures` option and related functionalities. The `pytest_cmdline_main` function in `src/_pytest/python.py` is central to the command-line options handling. It calls `showfixtures` and `show_fixtures_per_test`, which are responsible for displaying fixtures. These functions are essential for identifying relevant code spans. Additionally, the `FixtureRequest` class in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` defines the scope of fixtures, which is also relevant. The `pytest_cmdline_main` in other files like `cacheprovider.py`, `helpconfig.py`, etc., are about different options and not directly related to displaying fixture scopes with `--fixtures`. The `_showfixtures_main` and `_show_fixtures_per_test` functions are crucial as they manage the actual content displayed. The `write_fixture` function in `_show_fixtures_per_test` specifically handles the output of fixture information, making it highly relevant. Given the details, the identified spans are: 'pytest_cmdline_main' in `src/_pytest/python.py`, which initiates the fixture display. 'showfixtures' and 'show_fixtures_per_test' in `src/_pytest/python.py`, which are the main functions for showing fixtures. '_showfixtures_main' and '_show_fixtures_per_test' in `src/_pytest/python.py`, which contain the detailed logic for displaying fixtures.
