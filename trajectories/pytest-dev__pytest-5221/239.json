Their presence is crucial for understanding how fixture functionality is implemented within the pytest framework.\n\nGiven these points, all identified spans appear relevant to understanding and potentially modifying the pytest framework to show fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`.

The current implementation in `src/_pytest/python.py` includes functions like `showfixtures` and `_showfixtures_main` that handle displaying fixtures but do not explicitly show the scope. Similarly, in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`, the `FixtureRequest` class and related functions handle fixture request processing but do not directly address the requirement to show fixture scopes in the `--fixtures` output. The newer search results suggest that the `FixtureFunctionMarker` and `fixture` functions might be involved in defining fixture scope but do not directly relate to the display functionality. Based on the understanding of the issue and the current context, it seems that an enhancement is needed in the existing code to incorporate the fixture scope in the display output. This would likely involve modifying the `showfixtures` function to include scope information from the fixture definitions. I identify the relevant code spans from the search results that might be necessary for implementing the enhancement, such as the `fixture` and `yield_fixture` functions which define the scope attribute.",

These classes and functions handle the setup and teardown of fixtures, including their scope. The `FixtureRequest` class contains the scope attribute and methods like `_compute_fixture_value` that reference the scope. Additionally, the `fixture` and `yield_fixture` functions include the `scope` parameter in their definition. This indicates that the provided file context is relevant to the reported issue, as it includes the main components involved in defining and managing fixture scopes. It also contains the `src/_pytest/python.py` file with functions related to showing fixtures and their usage, although these do not directly display the fixture scope. However, the `pytest_fixture_setup` function does handle scope explicitly, suggesting the codebase is designed to manage fixture scopes effectively.
