From the provided search results, the relevant sections of the code are located in 'src/_pytest/python.py' and 'src/_pytest/fixtures.py'. The primary function of interest in 'src/_pytest/python.py' is `_showfixtures_main` which seems to be responsible for displaying fixture information, including possibly their scopes as it iterates over fixture definitions (fixturedef). Additionally, the 'src/_pytest/fixtures.py' file contains the definition of the `fixture` function which is where the scope of a fixture is defined, potentially indicating where the scope information originates. By focusing on these sections, we can ascertain if the current implementation provides scope details and determine if further modifications are needed to explicitly include scope information when fixtures are displayed.

Furthermore, the `FixtureFunctionMarker` class and the `fixture` function in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` contain the scope attribute which is essential for this enhancement.
