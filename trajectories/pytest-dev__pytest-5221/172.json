The analysis of the search results revealed several key components:\n\n1. **Fixture Definition and Scope:**\n   - The `FixtureFunctionMarker` class and the `fixture` function in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` are crucial as they define the scope of fixtures. These are referenced in spans 'FixtureFunctionMarker' and 'fixture'.\n\n2. **Fixture Display and Information:**\n   - Functions and logic related to displaying fixture information such as `showfixtures`, `_showfixtures_main`, and `write_docstring` in `src/_pytest/python.py` are relevant. These spans handle the presentation of fixture details and are essential for implementing the feature to show fixture scopes. Spans 'showfixtures', '_showfixtures_main', and 'write_docstring' are identified as relevant.\n\n3. **Fixture Initialization:**\n   - The `FixtureRequest` class and its `__init__` method in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` handle the initialization of fixture requests, including setting the scope. This is significant for understanding how fixture scopes are internally managed and could be leveraged to enhance the output of `pytest --fixtures`. The span 'FixtureRequest.__init__' is relevant here.\n\nBy focusing on these components, we can extract the necessary code spans that form the basis for enhancing the `pytest --fixtures` command to include fixture scopes. This approach ensures that we are targeting the correct parts of the codebase that either directly control or interface with fixture management and display.",
