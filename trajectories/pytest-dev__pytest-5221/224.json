The `showfixtures` and `_showfixtures_main` functions in 'src/_pytest/python.py' seem to be directly responsible for displaying fixture information. These functions iterate over fixture definitions, write their details, and could potentially be extended to include scope information. The 'resolve_fixture_function' and 'pytest_fixture_setup' functions in 'src/_pytest/fixtures.py' are also relevant as they handle fixture definitions and setup, indicating where scope information is likely to be used or can be accessed.

Analyzing the provided code spans, the function `_showfixtures_main` processes and displays information about fixtures. However, it does not currently include the scope information of each fixture.
