I then analyzed the 'src/_pytest/fixtures.py' file, focusing on the `FixtureRequest` class and its `__init__` method, which assigns a default scope of 'function' to fixtures. This is directly relevant to the issue as it pertains to fixture scope management. Subsequently, I examined the 'src/_pytest/python.py' file, especially the `showfixtures` function and the `_showfixtures_main` helper function, which handle the command-line option '--fixtures'. These functions assemble and display fixture information, although they currently lack scope detail, which aligns with the issue's requirements. These code spans offer a foundation for understanding current fixture management and indicating ideal locations for future scope detail integration.

The scope information is available in the `FixtureRequest` class and its subclass `SubRequest` through the `scope` attribute. To implement this, ensure that when `write_fixture` is called in `_show_fixtures_per_test`, it includes a line to output the scope of the fixture along with its name and location. Similarly, when listing the available fixtures in `_showfixtures_main`, append the scope information for each fixture next to its name and location in the output. This will provide users with immediate visibility into the scope of each fixture when using the `pytest --fixtures` command.",
