It involves a switch to `importlib` for the `import-mode` and reorganizing the tests to avoid import errors. The primary problem is that the initializer is executed but doesn't appear to have had any effect, due to two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` being present. The search should focus on the `pmxbot` package, specifically the `core` and `logging` modules, and investigate how the switching of import modes might have caused this issue. Additionally, the tests should be reviewed to see if there are any glitches in the module loading process.",
