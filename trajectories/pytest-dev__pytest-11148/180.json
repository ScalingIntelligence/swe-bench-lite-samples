The core problem seems to be that `pmxbot.logging` is present in `sys.modules` but with a different instance than what is found in the tests, causing the initializer's actions to seemingly have no effect. To address this, we need to locate the code that handles the import mechanics using `importlib` and ensure that it is not causing duplicate imports of the same module. Additionally, the code related to the `core.initialize()` function should be found to understand how the module initialization is being handled.",
