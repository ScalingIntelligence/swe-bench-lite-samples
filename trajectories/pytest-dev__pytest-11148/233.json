The tests fail because of the presence of two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` - one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`. This duplication is likely due to problems with the import mechanism or the way the modules are being loaded and managed in the system. To resolve this, it's crucial to identify the code responsible for module imports and management, especially in contexts where `importlib` is used. This includes looking into how `pmxbot.logging` is being handled and potentially how global state is being managed across different parts of the system.",
