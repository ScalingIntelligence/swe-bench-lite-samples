The search results contain code related to logging in pytest, specifically the `LogCaptureHandler` and `LoggingPlugin` classes in `src/_pytest/logging.py`. These classes handle logging within pytest and might be relevant to the issue since they deal with capturing and handling log records, similar to the `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store` mentioned in the issue. The `LogCaptureHandler` class initializes, emits, resets, and handles log records, while the `LoggingPlugin` class manages logging configurations and interactions during pytest runs. The `pytest_runtest_teardown` method in `LoggingPlugin` is particularly relevant as it deals with cleanup after test runs, which could explain where the logging setup might be being reset or conflicting. Therefore, these sections of code could be relevant to the issue of multiple logging modules being present during tests.",

The issue is further detailed with a failure in the tests due to the `core.initialize()` function seemingly not having an effect. The investigation reveals that the initializer is executed and sets a class variable `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`, but there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present. One in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`. The provided search results focus on the `LogCaptureFixture` class and `caplog` fixture in `src/_pytest/logging.py`, which are relevant components for capturing logs during tests. The `LogCaptureFixture` class manages the logging capture and formats the logs during test execution, while the `caplog` fixture provides an instance of `LogCaptureFixture` for use in tests. These components might not directly address the double import issue but are crucial for diagnosing and potentially resolving issues related to logging during tests.",
