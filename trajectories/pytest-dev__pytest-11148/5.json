The problem is that the initializer function `core.initialize()` seems to have no effect, and there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present. This could be due to how imports are being handled or how modules are being cached in `sys.modules`. The search results provided show various parts of the code related to importing and handling modules with `importlib`. Specifically, `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`, and `src/_pytest/python.py` contain relevant code spans that deal with module loading and handling in a pytest context, which might align with the problem of module duplication and initialization failure. These code spans include the `AssertionRewritingHook` class, which is responsible for rewriting assertions, and the `import_path` function, which handles importing modules based on their paths with different modes, including `importlib`. Additionally, the `Module._importtestmodule` method in `src/_pytest/python.py` shows how test modules are imported with different modes, which is directly related to the reported issue. These code spans could provide insights into how to fix or further investigate the issue of duplicated modules and ineffective initialization.",
