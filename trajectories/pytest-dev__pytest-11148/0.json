The issue occurs when switching to `importlib` and reorganizing tests, leading to two different versions of a module being present. The focus is on understanding how this duplication occurs and how to prevent it. \n\nThe search results provide valuable insights into pytest's plugin management and import handling, which could be affecting how 'pmxbot.logging' is being imported. Specifically:\n\n1. `src/_pytest/config/__init__.py` provides deep insight into pytest's plugin management with the `PytestPluginManager` class and its methods for importing plugins. Notably, you will see functions like `_importconftest`, `_getconftestmodules`, `_try_load_conftest`, and `_rget_with_confmod` which manage importing and handling of modules during test configuration.\n\n2. `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` defines the `AssertionRewritingHook` class which is responsible for rewriting of assertions for test modules. You have methods like `_should_rewrite`, `set_session`, and `get_data` which might influence how modules are rewritten and imported.\n\nExamining these code spans helps in understanding how pytest handles imports and module rewriting, pivotal points for identifying the problem. Given that the reported issue describes conditions for the pytest environment, code snippets such as `PytestPluginManager` and `AssertionRewritingHook` seem crucially involved in handling the imported modules, potentially overseeing the mechanism leading to the duplicated versions of the module. These areas need closer inspection to understand if the current import or rewrite logic could inadvertently lead to this phenomenon.",
