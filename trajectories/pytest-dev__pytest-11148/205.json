The search results include relevant code spans that handle module imports and manage the Python `sys.modules` dictionary. Here's my step-by-step justification for identifying relevant code spans:\n\n1. **TestModule.test_import_duplicate**: This test specifically checks for import mismatches, which could potentially relate to the issue of duplicated modules.\n2. **import_path**: This function is crucial as it handles the import of modules with different modes, including `importlib`. It aligns directly with the reported issue's context of switching to `importlib` for importing.\n3. **Module._importtestmodule**: This method imports test modules and can raise exceptions related to import errors, which could be indicative of the problem described. It uses the `import_path` function, making it part of the import process.\n4. **LocalPath.pyimport**: This method is used to import modules from local paths, which could also potentially lead to the duplication issue if not handled correctly, especially with the `importlib` mode.\n\nGiven these connections to the main issue of duplicated imports when using `importlib`, the identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the reported problem.",
