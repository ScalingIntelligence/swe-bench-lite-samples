This inconsistency is causing the tests to fail as the effects of `core.initialize()` are not having the intended effect across different parts of the code. The focus should be on identifying where and why the module is being imported multiple times, and then potentially utilizing mechanisms like `importlib` correctly to prevent this duplication. Given the detail in the issue, it's specific to the `pmxbot` project and its use of `importlib`. We should target this project's specific structure and focus on the `logging` module as it's central to the problem.",
