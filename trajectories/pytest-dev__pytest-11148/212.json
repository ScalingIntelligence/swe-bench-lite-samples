The traceback shows that there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present, one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`. This suggests an issue with how the module is being imported and managed in the codebase. The search results contain several relevant code spans that handle module imports and `sys.modules` manipulation, which are likely to be related to the issue. For instance, the `import_path` function in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` is responsible for importing modules using different modes, including `importlib`. This function manipulates `sys.path` and `sys.modules` directly, which could lead to the observed issue of duplicate module versions. Additionally, the `Module._importtestmodule` method in `src/_pytest/python.py` also deals with importing test modules and could be a source of the problem if the import mode is not handled correctly. Furthermore, the `test_import_duplicate` method in `testing/python/collect.py` specifically tests for import mismatches and could provide insight into how such issues are handled and possibly resolved. These spans of code are directly related to the import mechanisms and module management in the codebase, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",

The existing files do not directly show any `pmxbot` specific imports or usage of `importlib`, but the general pattern indicates complex interactions with importing mechanisms, especially concerning `importlib` itself. To accurately diagnose the issue, we need to narrow down the search to files directly pertinent to `pmxbot` operations such as `pmxbot/core.py` and `pmxbot/logging.py` since these house the critical functions `core.initialize()` and the setup of the `logging` module respectively. By focusing solely on these `pmxbot`-specific files, we can more precisely identify how the logging setup is affected when using `importlib` and isolate any duplicate module issues in `sys.modules`. This approach will also help us understand if and how `importlib` is utilized within the `pmxbot` package during its initialization process to prevent or solve the situation of module duplication.",

There is a specific bug described, where `pmxbot.logging` gets imported twice, causing test failures. The detailed examination of the provided code and search results reveals that the code spans identified are relevant to logging, which is a central part of the described issue. Specifically, the code in `src/_pytest/logging.py` handles log capture and logging configuration, which could be related to the duplicate module issue. Additionally, the logging configuration in `doc/en/conf.py` is also relevant for understanding how logging is set up in the project. Based on these findings, it appears that these code spans could be directly related to the issue reported, especially given the multiple instances of the `pmxbot.logging` module in `sys.modules` described in the issue.",

The issue is evident in the `pytest_collect_file` and `Module._importtestmodule` sections, where the `import_path` function is used to import modules with the specified import mode.\n2. The `pytest_addoption` and `pytest_configure` functions in `src/_pytest/logging.py` are responsible for setting up logging configurations based on the CLI options.\n3. The `src/_pytest/pytester.py` includes fixtures like `_sys_snapshot`, `SysModulesSnapshot`, and `SysPathsSnapshot`, which could be useful for managing the state of `sys.modules` and `sys.paths` during testing.\n4. `src/_pytest/junitxml.py` contains the `pytest_configure` function, which sets up the `LogXML` for JUnit XML reporting.",
