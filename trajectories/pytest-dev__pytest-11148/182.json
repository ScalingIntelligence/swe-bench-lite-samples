The provided search results contain several files with relevant code spans that might contribute to the issue. First, 'testing/python/collect.py' includes tests related to module imports and duplicates, which could indicate how the system behaves in such scenarios. The 'src/_pytest/pathlib.py' file contains the 'import_path' function, which is responsible for importing modules based on different modes, including 'importlib'. Understanding how this function operates with regard to sys.modules and ensuring it doesn't lead to duplicate entries is critical. Additionally, 'src/_pytest/python.py' has the 'Module._importtestmodule' method, which directly relates to importing test modules and could be the entry point where the duplicate import issue starts. Finally, 'src/_pytest/_py/path.py' includes the 'LocalPath.pyimport' method, which also handles module imports but with an additional parameter for 'importlib' mode. Investigating these spans should provide insight into whether the duplicate module entries in sys.modules are due to improper handling of import modes or other underlying issues.",

Possible areas to explore could include other configuration files, scripts that might interact with `pmxbot`, or any additional tools that are involved in the import process.
