            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a module being imported twice under import-mode=importlib, leading to discrepancies in the sys.modules cache. This can cause inconsistent states in the codebase, especially when dealing with mutable objects or stateful operations. The provided search results are primarily focused on import mechanisms and handling module import mismatches.\n\n1. Analyzing User Instructions:\nThe issue explicitly mentions the use of importlib for dynamic imports and the need to avoid multiple versions of the same module in sys.modules. The problem is further described with a specific test failure due to an AttributeError, hinting at an expected attribute not being present in the module object. This suggests a potential issue with how module state is managed during imports.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\nThe current file context provided includes several files dealing with import logic, such as '_pytest/pathlib.py' and '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py'. These files handle aspects like finding and loading modules dynamically, rewriting module imports, and managing module paths during tests. The context already identified sections related to module loading and ensuring syspath operations.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n3.1 Analyzing each code span in the new search results reveals additional files dealing with module import and handling mismatches. Key files and spans include:\n- 'src/_pytest/pathlib.py' with functions for importing modules using different modes including 'importlib'.\n- 'src/_pytest/python.py' which handles the collection of test modules and their import dynamically during test runs.\n- 'src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py' which includes utility for safely patching and resolving module imports.\n\n3.2 Matching these code spans with the reported issue, especially the mention of initialization failure due to multiple module instances, connects with how modules are managed and imported in the codebase. The 'import_path' function in 'pathlib.py' is particularly relevant as it directly addresses dynamic module loading using 'importlib'.\n\n3.3 The issue suggests needing to avoid or manage multiple imports of the same module. Relevant to this, the '_warn_already_imported' method in 'rewrite.py' and the 'pyimport' method in '_py/path.py' indicate checks and handling for already imported modules.\n\n3.4 Given the issue's focus on module state and its management, these are critical sections for ensuring single instances of modules are used, especially how they interact with the sys.modules cache and Python's import system.\n\n3.5 Reviewing entire sections ensures a complete understanding. For instance, understanding how 'pyimport' works within the larger context of 'LocalPath' class in '_py/path.py' provides insight into how import mechanics are integrated into path-based operations.\n\n3.6 References to other parts might not be explicitly found but understanding interconnections helps, like how 'python.py' integrates with import mechanisms to collect and run tests.\n\n3.7 Extracted relevant code spans focus on core logic dealing with dynamic imports, module state integrity checks, and handling of module mismatches, crucial for resolving the reported issue.",
