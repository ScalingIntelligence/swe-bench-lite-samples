Specifically, the regular expression used in self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1) is misinterpreting the multiline SQL, leading to incorrect duplicate identification and subsequent omission of valid 'order by' clauses. To address this, a search should be conducted focusing on the SQLCompiler class within the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, particularly the get_order_by() method, which is where the issue is identified.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the incorrect handling of order_by clauses in SQLCompiler when dealing with multi-line RawSQL expressions. Specifically, the problem arises because the regular expression used in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() is not properly handling multi-line SQL strings, leading to incorrect identification of duplicates based on the last line of the SQL expression. This results in some order_by clauses being improperly omitted from the final SQL query. Given the context provided, the relevant code spans are located in the SQLCompiler class within the get_order_by() method, particularly where the ordering_parts regular expression is defined and used. Additionally, the RawSQL class in another file also contains relevant code, although direct intervention here is not needed for fixing the issue. The focus should be on ensuring that the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method correctly processes multi-line RawSQL strings.\n\nBased on the search results, the identified code spans directly relate to the issue described. The get_order_by() method in SQLCompiler is where the ordering_parts regular expression is defined and used to process the SQL query. This method iterates through the ordering fields, resolves them, and attempts to compile them into SQL statements. The primary flaw here is the use of a regular expression that doesn't account for multi-line SQL, leading to incorrect groupings and the seen set being populated inaccurately. This behavior directly matches the issue described where multi-line SQL order by clauses are misinterpreted, causing incorrect omissions.\n\nAs a preliminary fix, the suggestion to change SQL handling by converting multi-line SQL into a single line before applying the regular expression could be a viable workaround. This change affects the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, ensuring it now has the capability to uniformly process SQL regardless of its formatting. This aligns with the broader fix intended to handle all forms of SQL input correctly and efficiently.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
