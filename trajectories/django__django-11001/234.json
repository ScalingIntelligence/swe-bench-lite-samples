The key problem is that the method is only comparing the last line of the SQL passed to the 'order by' clause, which can lead to incorrect removal of 'order by' clauses. \n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file. Specifically, the SQLCompiler class's get_order_by method is where the issue lies. The method uses a regular expression (self.ordering_parts) to parse the SQL and identify the 'order by' parts. However, this parsing fails when dealing with multiline SQL, as the regular expression only matches a single line containing ASC or DESC. This results in incorrect identification of duplicates. \n\nAdditionally, the RawSQL class in the django/db/models/expressions.py file is also relevant as it is used to create the multiline SQL expressions mentioned in the issue. This class provides methods to handle raw SQL strings, which are used in the 'order by' clauses. \n\nConsidering the issue at hand and the provided search results, the identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue.

The current implementation uses a regular expression to search for ordering parts in the SQL query. However, due to the multiline nature of the SQL, the regular expression is only capturing the last line of each RawSQL expression, leading to incorrect identification of duplicates and subsequent removal of valid 'order by' clauses. To address this, I propose normalizing the SQL query by removing newline characters before applying the regular expression. This will ensure that the entire SQL expression is considered as a single line, preventing the incorrect identification of duplicates.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
