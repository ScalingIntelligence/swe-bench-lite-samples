The problem lies in the way the method processes these multiline SQL strings, causing it to mistakenly treat different clauses as duplicates. The provided files suggest that the SQLCompiler class is defined in the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file, which is crucial for understanding and fixing this issue. Additional relevant files include django/db/models/expressions.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py, which might contain related logic that affects how RawSQL and order by clauses are handled. Given the context and the nature of the bug, focusing on these files and specifically the get_order_by method should be the first step in debugging and potentially fixing this issue.",

The problem is that the regular expression `ordering_parts` in `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` is not correctly handling multiline SQL, leading to incorrect identification of duplicates. This results in only the first 'order by' clause being returned. To address this, the analysis focused on the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method to find the specific code spans responsible for the problem. The method `get_order_by()` processes the 'order by' clauses, and the line `without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)` specifically deals with the SQL string to find the ordering part. The solution proposed by the user involves converting the multiline SQL to a single line to prevent incorrect matching. The identified code spans include the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method definition and the `ordering_parts` regular expression definition in the `SQLCompiler.__init__()` method. These spans are crucial for understanding and modifying the code to fix the issue.",

I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
