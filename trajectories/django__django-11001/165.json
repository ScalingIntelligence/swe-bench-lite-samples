The root cause seems to be in the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, where the regex self.ordering_parts is used to parse the SQL query, leading to the incorrect identification of duplicates. Specifically, the regex is parsing only the last line of the SQL query, which contains 'ASC' or 'DESC', and thus cannot differentiate between different multiline RawSQL expressions with identical last lines. The provided search result includes the definition of the SQLCompiler class and the implementation of the get_order_by() method.

This spans from the definition of the ordering_parts regex in the __init__ method to the usage of this regex in the get_order_by method.

This results in only the first 'order by' clause being retained when equivalent last lines (e.g., 'else null end') are present across multiple RawSQL expressions.\n\nFrom the provided file context in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method are clearly the focus. The method attempts to compile SQL ordering parts and checks for duplicates, which is where the problem occurs due to the multiline SQL handling.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context around the SQLCompiler class, specifically its __init__ method where the ordering_parts regular expression is defined. This reinforces understanding that the regex is key to the issue, as it aims to identify the 'order by' components but fails due to lack of proper multiline support.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the task should focus on identifying and providing the relevant code spans associated with SQLCompiler and its get_order_by method, particularly where the ordering_parts regex is used or defined, as these are directly linked to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
