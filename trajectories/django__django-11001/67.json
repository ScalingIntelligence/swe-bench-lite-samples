            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the incorrect removal of the 'order by' clause, especially when dealing with multiline RawSQL expressions. The core of the problem lies in the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, where the ordering parts are determined using a regular expression that fails to correctly identify such multiline orders. This is evident from the pattern 'self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)' which, in the case of multiline SQL, might return only parts of the order by clause, leading to duplicates being incorrectly identified and wrongly removed. The user suggested a quick fix involving replacing newline characters with spaces in the sql variable to ensure the regular expression works correctly across the entire SQL string, rather than line by line. The search results provide relevant code spans that directly address the issue. The most significant span is 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' which contains the method being addressed by the reported issue. This span includes the regular expression used to identify ordering parts ('self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)') and adds these parts to a 'seen' set, leading to potential incorrect removal of duplicates. Other spans, particularly 'SQLCompiler.__init__', 'SQLCompiler.as_sql', and 'QuerySet.order_by', are indirectly relevant as they provide context and related functions within the SQLCompiler class and QuerySet class, respectively. These help in understanding how the SQLCompiler interacts with SQL queries and how the order by clauses are added to queries in the first place. Based on the analysis, the provided search results do contain the relevant code spans needed to address the reported issue, particularly in identifying and potentially fixing the ordering clause detection in SQLCompiler.get_order_by().",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
