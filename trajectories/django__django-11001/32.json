The SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of the SQL when using multiline RawSQL, leading to incorrect ordering. To address this, the search should focus on the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method and the handling of RawSQL expressions in the ordering context.

The problem arises because the 'ordering_parts' regular expression is only matching the last line of the SQL, potentially leading to duplicates being misidentified and removed from the query. The user suggests a quick fix involving converting the multiline SQL to a single line, which would make the regex work correctly. The most relevant part of the code to address this issue is the 'get_order_by' method in the SQLCompiler class, where the regex is used to process the SQL and identify 'order by' clauses. Specifically, the problematic line is 'without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)', where 'sql' is not being normalized (i.e., converted from multiline to a single line) before applying the regex. Based on the user's proposed fix, implementing 'sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))' and then applying 'self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)' would likely resolve the issue. The provided search results include the SQLCompiler class definition, which houses the 'get_order_by' method containing the identified problematic line, making that part of the code highly relevant and likely the target for the fix.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
