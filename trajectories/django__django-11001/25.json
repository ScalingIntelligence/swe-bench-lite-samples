This leads to incorrect SQL query construction. The main focus should be on the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method as well as the RawSQL class handling within the context of ordering expressions. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the handling of multiline SQL and the deduplication logic in ordering is accurate and consistent.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the incorrect removal of the 'order by' clause in SQL queries, particularly those created as multiline RawSQL expressions. The problem is rooted in the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, where a regular expression incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of SQL passed to the 'order by' clause. This results in only the first 'order by' clause being retained in the final SQL query. To address this, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method needs to handle multiline RawSQL expressions properly, ensuring that each 'order by' clause is evaluated independently rather than just comparing the last line. The suggested quick fix involves converting the multiline SQL to a single line before applying the regular expression, which should help in correctly identifying each 'order by' clause.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant code spans are identified in the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file under the SQLCompiler class. Specifically, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method contains the logic that processes the 'order by' clauses and is likely where the bug is occurring. The self.ordering_parts regular expression is used here to parse the SQL and is likely the cause of the issue when dealing with multiline SQL. Additionally, the method where without_ordering is computed (without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)) is identified as the key line where the issue might be addressed by converting sql to a single line. The get_extra_select method is also relevant as it further manipulates the ordering parts.\n\nIn the django/db/models/expressions.py file, the OrderBy class is identified as relevant due to its role in handling ordering expressions, although no specific bug-related code is found here.\n\nLastly, in the django/db/models/sql/query.py file, the Query class is identified as relevant because it includes the base logic for constructing SQL queries, including order by clauses. Although no direct bug-related code is found here, it is included as context for understanding the bigger picture of SQL query construction.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans in the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file are directly relevant to the reported issue, particularly the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method and the handling of the ordering_parts regular expression.",

I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
