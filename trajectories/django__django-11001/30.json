The problem arises because the current implementation of avoiding duplicates in the 'order by' clause only compares the last line of the SQL passed to the clause, leading to incorrect results. To fix this, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method needs to be adjusted to properly handle multiline SQL and avoid incorrect duplicate identification.",

The issue specifically highlights a problem in the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method where the self.ordering_parts regular expression fails to correctly parse multiline SQL, leading to incorrect duplicate detection. This is evidenced by the example provided where RawSQL clauses with identical last lines are mistakenly identified as duplicates. The suggested quick fix involves converting the multiline SQL to a single line before applying the regular expression. \n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the code spans in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' are highly relevant as they directly deal with the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method, which is central to the reported issue. The spans including SQLCompiler.__init__ and SQLCompiler.get_order_by contain the initialization and the main logic of the get_order_by method, respectively, including the problematic regular expression usage and the seen set logic for duplicate detection. \n\nThe code spans in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' are also relevant as they define the OrderBy class and its methods, which are involved in the ordering process. Specifically, the spans for OrderBy.__init__, OrderBy.get_source_expressions, and OrderBy.as_sql are relevant as they deal with initialization, expression resolution, and SQL generation for ordering, respectively. These sections of the code are directly related to the ordering functionality that is failing in the reported issue.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, the search results do provide relevant code spans, particularly in the SQLCompiler and OrderBy classes, which should be sufficient to address the reported issue concerning the incorrect handling of multiline RawSQL in the 'order by' clause.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
