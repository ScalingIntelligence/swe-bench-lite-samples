            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the incorrect removal of the 'order by' clause in multiline RawSQL statements in the SQLCompiler. The problem is rooted in the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, where a regular expression is used to identify and handle ordering parts. This regex incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of the SQL passed to the order by clause, leading to the unintended removal of 'order by' clauses from the SQL query. Potential fixes involve ensuring that the SQL string is processed without newlines before applying the regex to avoid misidentification. Relevant classes and methods to focus on include SQLCompiler.get_order_by() in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, OrderBy in django/db/models/expressions.py, and QuerySet.order_by() in django/db/models/query.py.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the incorrect handling of the 'order by' clause in multiline RawSQL expressions within the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method. This issue can be traced to the current implementation of SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), specifically where it uses a regular expression (self.ordering_parts) to identify the 'order by' clauses in the SQL query. The problem arises because the regular expression is not able to handle multiline SQL properly, leading to only parts of the SQL being matched and thus causing duplicate clauses to be missed.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the relevant file appears to be 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py'. Within this file, the SQLCompiler class contains the get_order_by method which is directly related to the issue's description. The key part in this function is the use of self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1) to extract parts of the SQL query, which is where the problem lies due to the inability to correctly process multiline SQL.\n\nAnother file that partially relates to this issue is 'django/db/models/expressions.py', which contains the OrderBy class. Although not directly causing the issue, understanding how OrderBy handles SQL expressions could be helpful when deciding the necessary changes to fix SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\n\nGiven the issue's nature, the immediate step should be to address SQL handling in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() to correctly identify and parse 'order by' clauses in multiline SQL, possibly by adjusting how sql is processed or how the regular expression works. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to test any adjustments made to ensure they can handle conditionally added 'order by' clauses as per the examples provided in the issue.\n\nOverall, the search task is considered complete as I have located and identified the key parts in the relevant files where modifications or fixes are needed to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
