            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the SQLCompiler's handling of multiline RawSQL in the 'order by' clause. Specifically, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method is incorrectly identifying duplicates based on the last line of the SQL statement. This can cause the method to inadvertently remove valid 'order by' clauses. To address this, a potential fix involves normalizing the SQL string by removing newline characters, ensuring that the ordering parts are accurately identified without being confused by multiline formatting. The relevant code is likely to be found within the SQLCompiler class in the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file, particularly within the get_order_by() method. Additional context suggests that expressions involving RawSQL and OrderBy within the 'django/db/models/expressions.py' file might also be relevant.",

The key problem seems to be that the self.ordering_parts regular expression is not handling multi-line SQL correctly, leading to incorrect identification of duplicate clauses. The provided search results contain two main files: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py and django/db/models/expressions.py. The SQLCompiler class in the compiler.py file is of particular interest as it includes the problematic get_order_by() method and the ordering_parts regular expression. This method processes the ordering of SQL queries and is directly related to the issue mentioned. The RawSQL class in expressions.py is also relevant as it defines how raw SQL is handled and is likely used in the order by clauses affected by this bug. There are multiple spans of code within these files that are directly related to the processing of order by clauses and raw SQL, which would need to be reviewed or modified to fix the reported issue. These include the self.ordering_parts definition, the implementation of get_order_by(), and methods related to RawSQL and OrderBy expression handling. The identified spans of code provide a clear starting point for addressing the issue, but further detailed analysis and potential modifications may be required to fully resolve the problem.",

Specifically, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method is incorrectly identifying duplicates based on the last line of the SQL statement. This can cause the method to inadvertently remove valid 'order by' clauses. To address this, a potential fix involves normalizing the SQL string by removing newline characters, ensuring that the ordering parts are accurately identified without being confused by multiline formatting. The relevant code is likely to be found within the SQLCompiler class in the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file, particularly within the get_order_by() method. Additional context suggests that expressions involving RawSQL and OrderBy within the 'django/db/models/expressions.py' file might also be relevant.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
