The SQLCompiler is mistakenly identifying duplicate clauses based only on the last line, which causes it to incorrectly filter out some ordering clauses. To address this, we should focus on the `get_order_by` method in the SQLCompiler and potentially the `order_by` method in the QuerySet. Given the detailed description of the issue, it suggests that the problem lies in how the SQLCompiler processes the SQL query strings, especially when they contain multiline `RawSQL` expressions.",

The analysis of the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file reveals that the `SQLCompiler` class contains the `get_order_by` method, which is the focus of the issue. Within this method, the regular expression `self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)` is used to identify and process the 'order by' clauses. This regex only considers parts of the SQL query containing 'ASC' or 'DESC', which leads to incorrect duplication checks when dealing with multiline RawSQL. The current implementation of `get_order_by` does not properly handle multiline SQL and thus fails to correctly identify and process the 'order by' clauses when they are present in multiline RawSQL expressions. Additionally, the suggested fix involves converting the multiline SQL into a single line before processing to avoid incorrect duplication checks. This indicates a clear need for modifying the `get_order_by` method to handle multiline RawSQL correctly.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
