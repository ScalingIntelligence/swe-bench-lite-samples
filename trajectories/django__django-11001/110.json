The issue is that when multiple order_by clauses are used with multiline RawSQL statements, the SQLCompiler incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of the SQL rather than the entire SQL statement. This results in some order_by clauses being incorrectly omitted from the final SQL query. The provided search results include the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method, which are directly relevant to the reported issue. The get_order_by method contains the logic for handling the order_by clauses, including the problematic line where the without_ordering variable is computed using a regular expression on the sql variable. This line is the key location where the issue is occurring, as it does not account for multiline SQL statements properly. Therefore, the identified code spans include the entire get_order_by method which is necessary to understand and address the issue.",

The issue describes that this regex mistakenly considers only the last line of the multiline RawSQL, leading to incorrect duplicate identification and removal of order_by clauses. The method's logic for processing order_by clauses and the use of regex to identify duplicates aligns with the description provided in the issue. The quick/temporal fix suggested by the issue reporter involves modifying the SQL string to remove newline characters before applying the regex, which could be applied within the get_order_by method.

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
