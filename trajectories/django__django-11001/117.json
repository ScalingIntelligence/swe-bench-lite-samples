The problem lies in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() where multiline SQL strings are not correctly processed, leading to the omission of some order_by clauses. To address this, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method needs to be investigated and potentially modified to handle multiline SQL strings properly. Given the provided context, I will focus the search on the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method.",

The issue stems from the regular expression used in the ordering_parts attribute, which does not handle newline characters correctly. The relevant code sections are likely in the get_order_by() method and any methods that interact with or depend on it. From the search results, the SQLCompiler class in the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file contains the methods related to SQL compilation, including get_order_by(), which is responsible for constructing the ORDER BY clause of the SQL query. The analysis shows that the problematic part is in the get_extra_select() method, where the without_ordering variable is calculated using a regular expression that does not account for multiline SQL strings. This results in incorrect identification of duplicate clauses, leading to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant span ids for the identified issue are those related to the get_order_by() and get_extra_select() methods in the SQLCompiler class within the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
