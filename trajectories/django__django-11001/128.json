This method is responsible for constructing the 'order by' part of the SQL query. The issue arises because the 'order by' clauses are being compared based on the content of their last line, which can lead to incorrect duplicates being identified, particularly when using multiline RawSQL expressions.\n\nTo address this issue, it is necessary to analyze the 'get_order_by()' method in the SQLCompiler class, as well as the handling of RawSQL within the context of ordering parts. The method uses a regular expression self.ordering_parts to match and parse the 'order by' patterns, but this approach fails for multiline SQL due to the line-by-line processing. The provided quick fix suggests normalizing the SQL string by joining lines into a single line, which could potentially resolve the issue by making the patterns identifiable on a unified string level rather than per line.\n\nThe search results include relevant parts of the SQLCompiler and RawSQL classes:\n\n1. SQLCompiler class: The 'get_order_by()' method particularly is examined for its implementation of ordering logic. The method iterates over ordering fields, compiles expressions into SQL, and checks for duplicates using the content of the SQL strings without considering the multiline nature.\n\n2. RawSQL class: Relevant for understanding how RawSQL expressions are handled and compiled into SQL, particularly in the context that they can span multiple lines, which the current implementation of ordering does not properly accommodate.\n\nThe evaluation of search results indicates that these classes and methods directly relate to the reported issue. Extracting the 'get_order_by()' method from the SQLCompiler class and the basic initialization and SQL compilation of RawSQL class will provide sufficient context to address the issue.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, Django source code maintainers might benefit from a broader review of the SQL processing logic for instances handling of multiline SQL conditions across various features like filters and joins might encounter similar issues, recommending a systemic review of SQL parsing for complex, multiline SQL patterns.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
