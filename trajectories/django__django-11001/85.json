The provided quick fix involves making the SQL one-liner by removing newline characters.

The method seems to mistakenly identify duplicate ordering clauses based only on the last line of the SQL, which causes the removal of valid 'order by' clauses. The analysis of the provided search results reveals that the relevant code spans are located in the SQLCompiler class within the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file. Specifically, the init method and the get_order_by method are of importance. The get_order_by method processes the ordering of the SQL query, including the identification of duplicates using a regular expression on the SQL string. Notably, the method includes the computation of 'without_ordering' using a regular expression that processes the entire SQL string. The suggested temporal fix involves cleaning the SQL string of newline characters to avoid the incorrect identification of duplicate clauses. The QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py is also relevant as it includes the order_by method, which users call to set the ordering of the query. Given the identified code spans, it is clear that the issue is related to how the SQLCompiler processes the 'order by' clauses in the RawSQL expressions. Therefore, the identified spans are sufficient to address the reported issue, and the search task can be considered complete.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
