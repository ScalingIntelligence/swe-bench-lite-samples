            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the incorrect handling of 'order by' clauses in SQL queries, specifically when using multiline RawSQL expressions. The core problem lies in the SQLCompiler's method get_order_by(), where the regex pattern self.ordering_parts is used to search and isolate ordering parts of the SQL query. However, due to the multiline nature of the RawSQL, the regex incorrectly identifies duplicate 'order by' clauses based solely on the last line, leading to incorrect removal of valid ordering clauses.\n\nFrom the search results, the critical code spans are evident:\n1. The definition of self.ordering_parts in SQLCompiler's __init__ method.\n2. The main logic in the get_order_by method where ordering parts are processed and filtered.\n3. Specifically, the line 'without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)' is the focal point where the regex incorrectly identifies the ordering clause due to the newline characters.\n\nTo address this issue, a potential solution is to modify the handling of the SQL string to disregard newline characters during the regex search, as suggested in the reported issue. This approach ensures that the entire ordering clause is considered, rather than just the last line. Thus, the identified code spans directly relate to the issue by defining the problematic regex and implementing the problematic logic in the get_order_by function.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
