            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the SQLCompiler incorrectly removing 'order by' clauses created as multiline RawSQL. Specifically, the issue arises when the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method processes SQL queries that contain multiline RawSQL expressions with identical last lines, leading to the removal of some 'order by' clauses. This is evident in the code snippets provided, where the method SQLCompiler.get_order_by() contains logic to add order by clauses to a 'seen' set and then checks if a clause has already been seen before adding it to the final result. The problem stems from the regex pattern used to identify parts of the SQL query, which returns only the last line if the SQL is multiline. This has been identified in the code snippet where the method is defined and where the regex pattern (self.ordering_parts) is used to match and group parts of the SQL query. However, it also suggests that a workaround could be to make the SQL query one-liner by replacing newlines with spaces, which implies looking at how the RawSQL class and its methods such as __init__ and as_sql are implemented. The provided code spans give insights into the construction and compilation process of RawSQL expressions and how they might be used or referenced within the SQLCompiler's get_order_by method. Further examination might be needed to determine if there are direct effects on the RawSQL class due to the SQLCompiler's get_order_by method, or if other aspects of the query construction process are affected. Since the issue involves both the RawSQL class and the SQLCompiler's get_order_by method, both should be considered relevant for this issue.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
