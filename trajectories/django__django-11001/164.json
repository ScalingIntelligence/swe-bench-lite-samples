The method is incorrectly identifying and removing duplicate 'order by' clauses due to the multiline nature of RawSQL expressions, which causes the ordering_parts.search method to compare only the last line of each SQL statement. To address this, we need to find the specific implementation of the get_order_by method and the ordering_parts.search method. Additionally, checking where RawSQL is used in conjunction with the order_by method in QuerySet might provide more context on where the issue occurs.",

The user identified that the bug is in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, specifically where the ordering_parts regular expression is used. The analysis shows that the ordering_parts regular expression does not correctly handle multiline SQL statements, leading to the incorrect identification of duplicate 'order by' clauses. I found two relevant files in the search results: 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' and 'django/db/models/query.py'. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the SQLCompiler class contains the get_order_by method where the issue occurs. The crucial part of the code is where the ordering_parts regular expression is used to match 'order by' clauses. The user's suggested fix involves modifying the SQL string to remove newline characters before applying the regular expression, which ensures that the regular expression correctly processes the entire 'order by' clause. The 'QuerySet' class in 'django/db/models/query.py' also involves methods related to ordering, specifically the 'order_by' method, which could be relevant for understanding how ordering is controlled in Django queries. These files and their specific spans are the most relevant based on the reported issue.",

This method is the focal point of the reported issue as it handles the processing of 'order by' clauses, particularly in cases where RawSQL is used. The method attempts to avoid duplicates by using a regular expression (ordering_parts.search) which is likely where the issue lies when dealing with multiline RawSQL expressions. Additionally, the QuerySet class, which includes the order_by method, is also present in the file context. This is relevant because it shows where the RawSQL expressions are being used in connection with the order_by method.

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
