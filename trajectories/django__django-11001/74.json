            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about incorrect handling of the 'order by' clause when using multiline RawSQL expressions in Django's SQLCompiler. The issue arises because the current implementation of SQLCompiler.get_order_by() incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of the SQL expression, which can be identical across different RawSQL expressions. This leads to incorrect removal of 'order by' clauses.\n\nLooking at the search results, I notice the presence of SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, which contains the method get_order_by(). This method is directly related to the problem described in the issue, as it processes the 'order by' clauses and checks for duplicates. Specifically, the line `without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)` in the get_order_by() method is mentioned in the issue as the problematic part of the code where the order by clause is being incorrectly identified and processed. This line is responsible for removing duplicates based on the last line of the SQL expression, which is not reliable for multiline RawSQL expressions. Additionally, the file django/db/models/expressions.py contains the OrderBy class, which is closely related to the handling of ordering in SQL queries. Although the issue specifically mentions problems in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), understanding how OrderBy expressions are handled can also be relevant to addressing the problem.\n\nGiven these findings, it looks like the search results provide the necessary code to address the reported issue. Specifically, modifying the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py to handle multiline RawSQL expressions correctly would likely resolve the issue. The OrderBy class in django/db/models/expressions.py can also serve as context for understanding how order by expressions are processed in Django's ORM.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
