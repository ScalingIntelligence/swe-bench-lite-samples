The problem is that the 'order by' clauses in multiline RawSQL expressions are being incorrectly identified as duplicates and thus removed from the query. This occurs because the ordering_parts.search() method is only considering the last line of the SQL passed to the 'order by' clause. To address this, the search should be conducted on a version of the SQL query where newline characters are properly handled. Given the context and the nature of the issue, it is crucial to focus on the SQLCompiler class and its related methods, particularly get_order_by().",

Specifically, the regex used in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of the SQL, which leads to incorrect ordering when the last lines of multiple RawSQL expressions are identical. The relevant code spans in the provided search results primarily focus on the SQLCompiler class, especially the get_order_by method. This method is directly implicated in the issue as described. Several key areas are worthy of note. First, the ordering_parts regex definition in the __init__ method is central to the problem, as the regex tries to match specific parts of the SQL for ordering purposes. Second, the get_order_by method itself, where the regex is applied to the SQL strings during the ordering process, is a critical area to examine. The method's logic for checking and adding 'order by' clauses to the seen set could likely be modified to consider the entire RawSQL expression, not just the last line, to avoid incorrectly marking similar-ending lines as duplicates.",

The method `ordering_parts.search` is indeed used to process SQL queries within `get_order_by`, and the issue of duplicates in the `order by` clause is directly tied to this method. The responsibility for handling or manipulating SQL queries via `ordering_parts.search` lies within the `SQLCompiler` class, as the method `get_order_by` and the attribute `ordering_parts` are both present and relevant to the issue.

I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
