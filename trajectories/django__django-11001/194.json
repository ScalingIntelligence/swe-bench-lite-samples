The problem is caused by the SQLCompiler identifying duplicates based solely on the last line of the SQL passed to the order by clause, which leads to incorrect removal of certain order by clauses. The relevant class is SQLCompiler, and the specific method where the issue is suspected is get_order_by(). Additional relevant files might include those handling SQL expressions, such as expressions.py and query.py, which might have relevant logic for how RawSQL and ordering are processed. Since the issue involves RawSQL and specifically how order by clauses are handled, focusing on methods related to these aspects will be crucial.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the incorrect removal of an 'order by' clause in Django's SQLCompiler class when dealing with multiline RawSQL expressions. The problem is that the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method incorrectly identifies duplicates due to the comparison being made on the last line of the SQL passed to the order by clause. The issue is caused by the regular expression used in 'ordering_parts' which only matches parts of the SQL containing 'ASC' or 'DESC', which can lead to incorrect grouping of similar orders. This is problematic when SQL statements are multiline and therefore do not match exactly. However, the solution involves updating the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method to handle such cases appropriately by considering the entire SQL statement rather than just the last line. I identified two key sections from the search results: 1. The SQLCompiler class within django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, specifically the __init__ and get_order_by methods which contain the logic where the issue originates. 2. The RawSQL class in django/db/models/expressions.py, although indirectly related, it is necessary as it provides context to how RawSQL expressions are handled within Django's ORM. From the context of these code spans, it becomes clear that the immediate fix may indeed require changing the pattern matching approach within SQLCompiler.get_order_by(). It might be necessary to use a more sophisticated regular expression or to ensure that the entire SQL statement is considered during pattern matching to avoid false positives when identifying duplicate order by clauses.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
