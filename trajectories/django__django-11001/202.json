Specifically, the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method incorrectly identifies duplicates based on the last line of the SQL, leading to the removal of valid 'order by' clauses. The problem can be traced to the regex search in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() and how it processes multiline SQL strings. To resolve this, the regex needs to be applied to a single-line version of the SQL to ensure correct duplicate detection.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the incorrect removal of the 'order by' clause when using multiline RawSQL expressions in the SQLCompiler. The core of the problem lies in the SQLCompiler.get_order_by() method, where the self.ordering_parts regular expression is incorrectly identifying duplicates based on the last line of the SQL passed to the order by clause. This leads to only the first 'order by' clause being retained in the final SQL query. The suggested fix involves cleaning the sql variable of newline characters before applying the regular expression for ordering parts. The relevant code spans have been identified in the provided search results, focusing on the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method where the issue likely resides. Additionally, the OrderBy class in expressions.py has been noted, as it might be related to how ordering expressions are handled.\n\n1. Analyzed the reported issue and identified that the core problem is the incorrect identification of duplicates in the 'order by' clause when using multiline RawSQL expressions.\n2. Examined the SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, particularly the get_order_by method, which deals with ordering parts and might be where the issue occurs.\n3. Reviewed the OrderBy class in django/db/models/expressions.py as it might be relevant to how ordering expressions are managed and might need adjustments based on the reported issue.\n4. Noted the presence of re.compile(r'(.*)\\s(ASC|DESC)(.*)') as the regular expression for ordering parts, which is likely the key part where the fix will be applied or modified. Understanding the context of this regex is crucial for implementing correct behavior for multiline SQLs.\n5. Assessed the entire section of code to ensure a comprehensive understanding. Including places like RawQuery and QuerySet to understand if there are dependencies that might be affected by any changes in SQLCompiler or expressions.py.\n6. Determined that there are no references to other parts of the codebase that could be relevant but not found in the search results based on the provided context of the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.\n"
