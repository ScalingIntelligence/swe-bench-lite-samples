The primary focus is on the method `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` and how it processes expressions involving exponents. The provided search results from `sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py` offer key insights into how dimensions are managed, including methods for arithmetic operations and dimensional dependencies. From `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, the `Quantity` class and its static methods related to dimensional analysis are important, particularly the deprecated `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method that suggests a direct link to the reported issue. By analyzing these code spans, we can pinpoint the exact logic responsible for dimensional analysis and potentially identify the root cause of the reported bug. The relevant spans include those handling basic dimension arithmetic, exponentiation, and the method in question from the `Quantity` class.",

The methods `_eval_power`, `__mul__`, and others handle how dimensions behave under multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n\n3. **DimensionSystem**: Manages a system of dimensions, including base and derived dimensions, and is responsible for resolving dependencies and defining how dimensions interact within a system.\n\n4. **UnitSystem**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the report, this class is involved in collecting factors and dimensions, specifically through the method `_collect_factor_and_dimension`, which is suggested to be used instead of the deprecated method in `Quantity`. This method comprehensively handles various types of expressions to decompose them into their numerical factors and dimensions, making it central to solving the reported issue.\n\nGiven these elements, it is apparent that the functionality of `_collect_factor_and_dimension` within `UnitSystem` is directly relevant to addressing the reported problem.
