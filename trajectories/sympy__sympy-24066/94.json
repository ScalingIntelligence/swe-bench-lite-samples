This method is crucial for handling dimensional analysis in the SI unit system within the SymPy library. The error occurs when processing an expression involving `exp(expr)` where `expr` is a combination of units. It is likely that this method or its dependencies need to be investigated to ensure proper handling of dimensionless quantities and their exponents. The search should focus on the `si.py` file and the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, as well as any related methods and classes that might influence how dimensions are collected and processed.",

This issue is critical as it leads to incorrect dimension calculations for expressions containing exponentials. Upon analyzing the provided search results, it is evident that the method in question is located within the UnitSystem class in the file 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py'. The code span with id 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension' contains the method definition that is likely causing the error. This method is responsible for collecting the factor and dimension from an expression, which is precisely the functionality that seems to be malfunctioning according to the issue description. Additionally, the method's handling of different types of expressions (e.g., Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, Function) suggests that the error might be occurring specifically when dealing with Function type expressions, such as exponentials. This aligns with the problem described in the issue, where an exponential expression leads to a ValueError because the dimension of the exponent is not correctly identified as dimensionless. Furthermore, the 'Quantity' class in 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py' has a deprecated method '_collect_factor_and_dimension', which redirects to the UnitSystem class method, supporting the focus on 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension' as the relevant code span for addressing the issue.",

To address this, we need to focus on the implementation of this method in the UnitSystem class. Specifically, the method should correctly handle the case where an expression is the argument to a function, such as exp().\n\nThe relevant code spans are found in sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py, where the UnitSystem class defines the _collect_factor_and_dimension method. This method is responsible for recursively evaluating the dimensions and factors of expressions, including handling of multiplicative, power, additive, derivative, and function cases. The current implementation of this method does not explicitly account for functions like exp() when evaluating dimensions, which is likely why the issue arises. Additionally, the DimensionSystem class in sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py includes the is_dimensionless method, which checks if a dimension represents a dimensionless quantity and is used within the _collect_factor_and_dimension method to evaluate the dimensions of expression parts.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the key spans are the definition of _collect_factor_and_dimension in UnitSystem and the is_dimensionless method in DimensionSystem. These are the core pieces of code that need to be inspected and potentially modified to resolve the issue. The identified spans encompass the method implementations and their specific handling of different expression types, providing the context necessary to understand and fix the problem related to the exponential function's argument dimensions.\n\n",
