This suggests that the problem lies within the handling of the exp() function within the sympy library, specifically in the sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py file. The relevant spans of code to investigate would be those that deal with the properties and evaluations of the exp() function, particularly how the function handles dimensions or units. This includes the ExpBase class and its methods, especially those dealing with inverse, base-exp relationship, and evaluation properties like adjoint, conjugate, transpose, finiteness, rationality, and zero-checking.\n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue, it seems the problem might be in how the exponent is being processed in the context of dimensions in the expression involving exp().\n2. The search results include the ExpBase class and its methods, which are relevant as they deal with the properties of the exp() function. In particular, methods like `as_base_exp`, which normalize the base, and `inverse`, which returns the logarithm, are of interest as they are likely involved in handling the exponent and its properties.\n3. The `_eval` methods like `_eval_adjoint`, `_eval_conjugate`, and `_eval_is_finite` also provide insights into how the function's properties are evaluated. They might not directly handle dimensions but show how the function's arguments are processed.\n4. The `exp_polar` class, a subclass of ExpBase, and its method `as_base_exp` should also be reviewed as they handle specific aspects of the exponentiation.\n5. Finally, the `log` class and its methods like `_eval_is_rational` and `_eval_is_finite` provide a contrasting view of how a similar mathematical function (logarithm) handles critical properties, which is useful for comparison.\n\nBased on the examination, the spans providing relevant context for solving the reported issue are those dealing with the ExpBase class's methods and, to a lesser extent, the `exp_polar` handling and the contrasting `log` class methods.",

This method is responsible for collecting the factor and dimension of an expression and should handle cases involving Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, and Function. The issue at hand specifically involves an expression with an exponent, likely falling under the Pow or Function category. The current implementation in the search results does not explicitly handle the case where an exponent is expected to be dimensionless. This omission could be the root cause of the issue.
