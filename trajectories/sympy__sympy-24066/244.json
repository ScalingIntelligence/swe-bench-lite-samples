The search results include several key files: unitsystem.py, quantities.py, dimensions.py, and util.py. The relevant code spans are found in the UnitSystem class in unitsystem.py, specifically the methods _collect_factor_and_dimension and get_dimensional_expr. These methods are responsible for processing expressions to collect factors and determine dimensions. Additionally, the Quantity class in quantities.py contains deprecated methods for collecting factor and dimension, which are still relevant as they point to the UnitSystem methods. The Dimension class in dimensions.py is also relevant for handling dimensions and dimensional dependencies. Finally, the util.py file contains a function check_dimensions, which could be utilized or modified to enhance dimension checking. By analyzing these code spans, we can identify the areas that need to be addressed or improved to resolve the reported issue.",

This issue is evident when the function is used in expressions involving the `exp` function and specific units. The primary focus is on improving or fixing the logic within `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` to correctly handle dimensions for such expressions.\n\nThe current file context and search results contain several relevant parts of the code base:\n1. `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` includes the main `UnitSystem` class with `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method that is of primary interest.\n2. `sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py` contains the `Dimension` class and related methods which are crucial for understanding and manipulating dimensions.\n3. `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` includes the `Quantity` class, although the relevant methods have been deprecated and moved to the `UnitSystem` class.\n\nThe `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method in the `UnitSystem` class is where the logical error seems to occur as it does not handle the dimension of exponents correctly, especially when they should be dimensionless. This method needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure it correctly identifies and processes dimensionless exponents.\n\nGiven the complexity of handling dimensions in mathematical expressions, particularly with functions like `exp`, a detailed examination of how dimensions are collected and evaluated in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method will be necessary. Additionally, understanding how dimensions interact within compound expressions involving quantities with different units will be key to resolving this issue.",

The method currently processes various expressions but does not account for exponentials properly, leading to the reported ValueError. The related classes, like Dimension and Quantity, and the UnitSystem class, are analyzed to support understanding of where enhancements might be needed to address the issue. The review of the provided file context indicates that while the relevant classes and methods are present, there is no explicit handling or correction for exponentials meant explicitly to ensure that the exponent in such expressions is treated as dimensionless. Therefore, while the relevant context is provided within the file context, the specific logic to handle exponentials directly in the _collect_factor_and_dimension() method and ensure dimensionless treatment for exponents, as required by the issue, is not present. Hence, extending the functionality of this method to support exponential operations correctly would be necessary for a comprehensive solution.",
