This error occurs when attempting to add an exponential function to a dimensional expression. The method seemingly fails to handle the dimension of the exponential part correctly, leading to a ValueError. The focus should be on the SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() method in the sympy.physics.units.systems.si module and potentially related dimension handling functions in sympy.physics.units.dimensions, sympy.physics.units.quantities, and sympy.functions.elementary.exponential. The goal is to identify the specific function or logic that incorrectly assesses the dimension of the exponential part.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is related to the function SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() in the SymPy library, specifically where it fails to properly detect that the exponent is dimensionless. This failure can be reproduced using a specific expression involving units and the exp function from SymPy. To address this, it is crucial to identify the relevant code spans that handle the collection of factor and dimension in the UnitSystem class and the Quantity class since these are directly related to the function in question. Additionally, it is important to review the handling of the exp function to ensure that it is correctly interpreted within the context of unit dimensions.\n\nIn the provided search results, several key spans of code are relevant:\n\n1. sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py\n- Span id='UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension': This span contains the implementation of the _collect_factor_and_dimension method in the UnitSystem class, which is central to the issue as it is where the factor and dimension of expressions are collected and manipulated. It handles various types of expressions, including Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, and Function, and is likely where the error in handling the exp function exists.\n\n2. sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\n- Span id='Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension': This span shows the deprecated method in the Quantity class, which is now redirected to the UnitSystem class\u2019s method. This confirms the main method to investigate is indeed in the UnitSystem class.\n\n3. sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py\n- Various spans related to the ExpBase and exp classes: These spans detail the implementation of the exp function itself, which is used in the reported issue. Understanding how the exp function is handled in SymPy, especially in terms of its properties and evaluations, is crucial for identifying where the handling of dimensions might go wrong.\n\nBy focusing on these spans, it is possible to trace the source of the error and identify the necessary modifications to ensure that SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() properly detects that the exponent is dimensionless.",

Thus, a lint error has occurred about the undefined 'exp'. This update relocates the import statement from the previous change inside the \"_collect_factor_and_dimension\" method to a more appropriate place at the beginning of the file, where other imports are located.
