This indicates that the method may not handle dimensionless expressions within the exponent correctly. Given the traceback provided in the issue, we should focus our search on the SI class and its method _collect_factor_and_dimension(), as well as explore the handling of exponential functions within the sympy.physics.units subsystem. We should also consider examining utility functions in sympy.physics.units.util as they might be relevant for dimensional analysis.",

From the provided code, it's evident that the logic for collecting the factor and dimension in the `UnitSystem` class does not properly handle the exponentiation of a Quantity object that should be dimensionless. Two areas of the code are particularly relevant: `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`. In the first file, the `Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension` method redirects to the `UnitSystem` method. In the second file, the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` handles the various types of expressions including exponents, but does not correctly account for the dimensionless nature of exponents, as demonstrated in the provided bug report. This is likely the source of the issue. Additionally, the exponential function from `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` is involved when dealing with the exponent, and the code in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` provides utility functions for handling dimensions and quantities, further confirming relevance for the issue analysis.",
