This issue is directly addressed in the search results, particularly in the sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py file where the actual implementation of the method is found. The relevant span is 'UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension', which handles the collection of factors and dimensions, including how it processes 'Mul', 'Pow', 'Add', 'Derivative', and 'Function' types within an expression. The method checks each part of the expression to ensure that its dimensions are correctly calculated, and if not, it raises an error. This is exactly where the reported issue comes into play, suggesting that the method is not handling the testing for dimensionless exponents correctly. Furthermore, there is a method in 'Quantity' class in sympy/physics/units/quantities.py that also relates to this and has been deprecated, advising to use the one in 'UnitSystem' class instead, which is in line with the new implementation.

However, the handling of `Function` instances, including `exp`, is currently captured in a way that does not ensure the exponent is correctly identified as dimensionless. The method raises a `ValueError` when dimensions do not match, as seen in the issue description. This indicates the current implementation's limitation in handling exponents in such contexts.
