Upon reviewing the search results, it is clear that the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method is defined in the `UnitSystem` class within the `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` file. This class method is responsible for collecting the factor and dimension from an expression. Furthermore, there is a deprecated method with the same name in the `Quantity` class in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, which redirects to the `UnitSystem` method. Since the issue pertains to the behavior of this method within the `SI` unit system, the relevant code span is indeed the one in the `UnitSystem` class.

The issue specifically arises with the handling of the `Function` type, particularly when processing the `exp` function, where the method fails to recognize the exponent as dimensionless. To address this, one approach could be to enhance the handling of `Function` types within this method, possibly by introducing additional checks for dimensionless exponents.
