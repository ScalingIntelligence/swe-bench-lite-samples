The error occurs specifically when handling expressions involving `exp(expr)`, where `expr` has dimensions. This suggests that the problem could be in the handling of exponential functions within the `SI` unit system, possibly related to how dimensions are computed or how exponential functions are processed. Relevant files might include those containing the `SI` class, methods for collecting factors and dimensions, and potentially the implementation of exponential functions. Searching specifically for the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` method and the `exp` function within the relevant modules could help pinpoint the issue.",

This function is crucial for determining the dimensions of expressions, and the error occurs when handling expressions involving the exponential function, exp(). I first reviewed the existing code in 'sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py', where the exponential function is defined. I noticed that there are helper methods like _eval_is_rational and _eval_is_finite which could be relevant for handling exponents, but they don't directly address the dimension issue. Moving on to the new search results, I found the function _collect_factor_and_dimension in 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py'. This function recursively collects factors and dimensions, handling different types of SymPy expressions like Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, and Function. The function deeply checks each element's dimensions and combines them correctly. This seems directly related to the issue reported, as the error occurs during the dimension calculation of an expression containing exp(). I also checked 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py', which deprecates the method _collect_factor_and_dimension for the Quantity class, suggesting it's moved to the UnitSystem class, further confirming the relevance of the function in 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py'. The provided code spans from the search results also give insights into how dimensions are combined, which could be crucial for debugging. Based on this analysis, the search results are relevant and complete regarding the issue.",
