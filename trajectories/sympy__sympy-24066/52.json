To diagnose and potentially fix this issue, we need to focus on the exp class and its methods, particularly those related to handling expression evaluation and substitutions. The relevant code spans should include methods that evaluate, substitute, and handle expressions containing exp, as these are likely to impact the functionality of SI._collect_factor_and_dimension().\n\nFrom the provided file context, we already have references to the exp class and methods such as eval, _eval_subs, and _eval_nseries, which are crucial for evaluating and manipulating exponential expressions. The new search results include additional relevant methods from the exp class, such as fdiff, _eval_refine, base, taylor_term, _eval_is_extended_real, _eval_is_complex, _eval_is_algebraic, _eval_is_extended_positive, and _eval_rewrite_as_sqrt. These methods are important for understanding how the exp function behaves under different conditions and for implementing the necessary checks for dimensions and units.\n\nGiven that the issue involves a ValueError when handling dimensions, the methods that explicitly deal with evaluating the dimensions (_eval_is_extended_real, _eval_is_complex, _eval_is_algebraic, and _eval_is_extended_positive) are particularly relevant. Additionally, the _eval_rewrite_as_sqrt method could be relevant if it involves operations that might affect the dimensional analysis of the expression.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the exp class methods, which are directly or indirectly involved in the processing of expressions that SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() handles. Therefore, these methods should be examined closely to ensure correctness in the context of dimensional analysis and expression evaluation.",
