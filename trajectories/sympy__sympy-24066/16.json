The reported issue mentions SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() and SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(). We should look for implementations of these methods and related functionalities in the code spans provided. After reviewing the search results, the following are identified as relevant:\n1. In 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py', the method `Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension` is directly related to the issue as it handles the collection of factors and dimensions.\n2. In 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py', the method `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` is the current implementation that replaces the deprecated method in the 'quantities' module. This method handles the collection logic.\n3. In 'sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py', the class `DimensionSystem` includes methods related to dimension operations and systems, such as `DimensionSystem._get_dimensional_dependencies_for_name`. This class could be relevant for understanding dimension logic and fixing the issue with detecting dimensionless exponents.\nThese spans provide insights into the current logic for handling dimensions and factors, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue. Next steps would involve deeper inspection of these code spans to identify where and how the logic for recognizing dimensionless exponents might be incorrect or incomplete.",

The Dimension class methods and DimensionSystem class methods in sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py are also relevant as they deal with dimension calculation and detection, but do not specifically cover the case of exponential functions in the provided context.

Specifically, the function should ensure that the dimensions of the arguments passed to `exp` (or any other function) are correctly handled and checked for dimensionless status. Given the search results, the relevant code spans that address this issue are found in the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method in `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` and the `Dimension` class in `sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py`. These spans include the handling of `Function` types and the power operation, both of which are crucial for ensuring the correct detection of dimensionless quantities. Additionally, the `DimensionSystem._get_dimensional_dependencies_for_name` method in `sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py` is relevant for understanding how dimensions are derived and checked, which is important for the overall context of the issue.",
