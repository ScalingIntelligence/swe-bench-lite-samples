The search results provide two files: 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py' and 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py'. In 'unitsystem.py', the relevant code spans include the 'UnitSystem' class and specifically the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method, which is where the issue potentially arises. The '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method in this class handles the collection of factors and dimensions for various expression types, including Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, and Function. The error described in the issue likely stems from the handling of the Function type, where the dimension of the exponent is not correctly identified as dimensionless. It's important to note that this method directly relates to the reported issue by affecting how dimensions are collected and calculated. In 'quantities.py', the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method is deprecated, suggesting the direct issue is handled in the UnitSystem class in 'unitsystem.py', reinforcing the need to focus on that class.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant sections of the code include the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method in the 'UnitSystem' class, particularly the handling of Function types, as this directly pertains to the issue described. The deprecated method in 'quantities.py' provides confirmation that the issue should be addressed in the 'unitsystem.py' file, thus limiting the need to examine other files for this specific issue.",
