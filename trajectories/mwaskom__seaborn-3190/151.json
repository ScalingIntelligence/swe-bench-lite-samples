This suggests a mismatch in how the data is being handled by the scale setup mechanism. Given the traceback, the critical section seems to be in the `_setup` method of `ContinuousBase` within `seaborn/_core/scales.py`, where the boolean values are being processed. Additionally, the `_setup_scales` method in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` might be where the assignment of the scale is happening, possibly incorrectly assigning a continuous scale to boolean data. The `Color` class in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` is also relevant, as it involves color mapping, which might play a role in handling boolean data for color assignments.",

The traceback points to the '_setup_scales' method in 'seaborn/_core/plot.py' as the source of the error, specifically where the 'ContinuousBase._setup' method is called. The error occurs because numpy does not support subtraction between boolean types. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the setup of scales and the processing of boolean data types.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, I found the relevant code spans in 'seaborn/_core/plot.py' and 'seaborn/_core/scales.py'. In 'seaborn/_core/plot.py', the '_setup_scales' method is responsible for setting up scales for variables, and it calls the '_get_scale' method to obtain the appropriate scale for each variable. The '_get_scale' method then uses the 'prop.infer_scale' and 'prop.default_scale' methods to determine the scale. In 'seaborn/_core/scales.py', the 'ContinuousBase._setup' method is where the error occurs when handling boolean data types. This method is responsible for setting up the scale based on the data type, and it involves calculations that are not supported for boolean types in numpy.\n\nBy identifying these code spans, we can pinpoint the exact locations where the issue occurs and determine the necessary changes to support boolean data types in color mapping.",
