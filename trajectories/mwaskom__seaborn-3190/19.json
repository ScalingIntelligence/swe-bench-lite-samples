The traceback indicates that the issue arises in the `_setup_scales` method of the `Plotter` class in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`. Specifically, the error occurs at this line: `self._scales[var] = scale._setup(var_df[var], prop)`. The error message suggests that numpy boolean subtraction is not supported. This likely means that the color mapping process is not properly handling boolean data types. To find the exact code where this issue might be occurring, we should focus on the `_setup_scales` method and related color mapping functionalities in `plot.py` and `scales.py`. Additionally, since the error involves a `TypeError` related to boolean subtraction, we should look for any instances of boolean data manipulation in the relevant files.",

This error occurs when trying to subtract boolean values in the `ContinuousBase._setup` method, specifically in the line `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` in the file `seaborn/_core/scales.py`. To address this, we need to identify where the color mapping setup occurs and how boolean data is handled. The relevant code spans include the `Plotter._setup_scales` method in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`, which sets up scales for plot variables, and the `Color.get_mapping` method in `seaborn/_core/properties.py`, which maps colors to data values. Additionally, the `ContinuousBase._setup` method in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` is relevant as it contains the code that triggers the error. These methods and their contexts are crucial for debugging and fixing the issue, particularly ensuring that boolean data types are handled correctly during color mapping.",

The code shown in `plot.py` details how scales are set up, including the transformation of data types. The `scales.py` file contains the `ContinuousBase` class, which suggests where the type handling issues might occur for continuous data like boolean values. Given these contexts, it appears that all necessary segments of the codebase to understand and potentially address the issue are present.
