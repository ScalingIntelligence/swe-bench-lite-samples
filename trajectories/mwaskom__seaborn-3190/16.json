This method should be targeted to identify why it fails when boolean data is used for color mapping.

The traceback points directly to the `ContinuousBase._setup` method in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` where the operation `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` is attempted with boolean data, which is not supported. The relevant code spans to address this issue include all the spans in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` since they deal with the Plot and Plotter classes involved in the plotting process, including the handling of scales and layers. Additionally, all spans in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` are relevant as they define the Scale class and its subclasses including ContinuousBase, which directly handles the scale setup and transformation that causes the TypeError. The presence of boolean data in the `color` attribute of the Plot class is the root cause of the issue, so all related spans in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` and `seaborn/_core/scales.py` must be considered for a comprehensive solution.",
