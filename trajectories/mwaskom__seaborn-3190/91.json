The traceback points to a specific line in the `seaborn/_core/scales.py` module, where a subtraction operation between boolean values is causing the error. The relevant code spans need to be identified in the context of this error and the surrounding logic related to scaling and color mapping.\n\n1. **Plotter._setup_scales Method Analysis**: The method `_setup_scales` in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` is responsible for setting up scales for plot variables. Within this method, the `_setup` method of the `scale` object is called for each variable. This suggests that the error might be occurring during the setup of the scale for the 'color' variable.\n\n2. **Color.infer_scale and Color.get_mapping Methods Analysis**: In `seaborn/_core/properties.py`, the `Color` class handles color mapping. Specifically, the `infer_scale` method determines the type of scale (Nominal or Continuous) based on the data type. The `get_mapping` method then creates a mapping function for color scale. These methods are likely places where boolean data is being interpreted and processed.\n\n3. **ContinuousBase._setup Method Analysis**: In `seaborn/_core/scales.py`, the `ContinuousBase` class has a `_setup` method where the specific line causing the error is located. This method sets up continuous scales and performs operations like normalization and transformation.\n\nConsidering these points, the relevant code spans to address the issue would include the mentioned methods and the specific line in `ContinuousBase._setup` where the TypeError occurs.",
