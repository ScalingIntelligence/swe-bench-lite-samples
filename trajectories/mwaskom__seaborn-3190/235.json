The error occurs during the setup of scales in the `Plotter._setup_scales` method. To address this issue, we need to focus on the interaction between boolean data and color scaling, potentially involving the properties and scales defined in `seaborn._core`. Given the traceback, we should start by investigating the `_setup_scales` method and related functionalities in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`. Additionally, we should look into how scales are handled and set up in `seaborn/_core/scales.py`, particularly within the `ContinuousBase` class which seems to be involved in the arithmetic operation that fails with boolean data.",

The specific error indicates that numpy does not support boolean subtraction and suggests using bitwise_xor or logical_xor instead. Given this information, I reviewed the relevant code spans in the provided context and the search results, focusing on the `ContinuousBase._setup` method and the surrounding code. The goal is to identify the necessary code spans to address the issue of boolean data handling within the color mapping setup. The relevant code span in the search results is `ContinuousBase._setup`, specifically the portion dealing with normalization where the error is thrown. Additionally, it's important to see if there are any utilities or methods in the provided code for converting boolean data to a format suitable for plotting, though none were found explicitly in the provided snippets. From the context, we already have the relevant files and methods identified that handle the plotting and scaling processes.
