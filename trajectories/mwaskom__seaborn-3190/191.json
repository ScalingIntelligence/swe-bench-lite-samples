This likely occurs within the `_setup_scales` method of the `Plotter` class in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`. The error specifically points to a TypeError when performing a boolean subtraction, suggesting that a check or conversion for data types might be missing or incorrect in the scaling setup. Additionally, the `ContinuousBase._setup` method in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` is where the actual TypeError occurs. To resolve this, it's crucial to identify where boolean data enters the scaling process and ensure that it is appropriately handled or converted to a supported type before any arithmetic operations. Also, the `Color` class in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` should be reviewed for how it handles and infers scales for boolean data types.",

The `seaborn/_core/plot.py` file contains the `Plot` and `Plotter` classes, which are likely relevant to solving this issue.

Since 'Plotter._setup_scales' is not provided, we should implicitly check or note the handling of boolean data by ensuring that when 'Plot._plot' calls scale setup methods, it treats boolean data as 'categorical'. Look for any immediate calls to scale setup in 'Plot._plot' and ensure they handle boolean data similarly to categorical data. Specifically, modify 'Plot._plot' to keep track of or verify the classification of boolean data before scale setup and ensure it's treated as nominal, not continuous.",
