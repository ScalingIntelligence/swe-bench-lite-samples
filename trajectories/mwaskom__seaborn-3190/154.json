The traceback points to the '_setup_scales' method in 'seaborn/_core/plot.py' where the error is triggered. The error message indicates that numpy boolean subtraction is not supported, suggesting a problem with how boolean values are being handled during the scaling process. Following the traceback, the error originates in the 'ContinuousBase._setup' method in 'seaborn/_core/scales.py' at the line where 'forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)' is attempted. This operation is not valid for boolean data types, leading to the TypeError. Based on this analysis, I have identified the relevant code spans in 'seaborn/_core/plot.py' and 'seaborn/_core/scales.py' that require attention to resolve the issue. These spans include the 'Plotter._setup_scales' method and the 'ContinuousBase._setup' method, which are central to handling the scaling of data, including the color data in question that is causing the error.",
