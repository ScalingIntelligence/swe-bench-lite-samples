The focus should be on how boolean data is handled within this method, especially in the call to `scale._setup(var_df[var], prop)` which probably leads to the `ContinuousBase._setup` method due to the nature of the error - 'numpy boolean subtract, the `-` operator, is not supported.'\n\nFrom the search results, the `ContinuousBase._setup` method indeed contains logic that might not handle boolean data properly, specifically when normalizing data for continuous scales.\n\nIn the `seaborn/_core/scales.py` file, the `ContinuousBase._setup` method includes lines where normalization of data is attempted using subtraction (specifically `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)`). This operation is likely where the error occurs when the data is boolean.\n\nThe solution involves ensuring that boolean data is either properly cast to a type that supports arithmetic operations or handled in a specialized manner within the scaling logic. This could involve adding type checks and conversions within the `ContinuousBase._setup` method.\n\nThe relevant code spans are identified to be within `ContinuousBase._setup` in `seaborn/_core/scales.py`.

This error is encountered during the scale setup process within the `Plotter._setup_scales` method in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`. Specifically, the error arises from the line where `a = forward(vmin)` and `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` are executed within the `ContinuousBase._setup` method in `seaborn/_core/scales.py`. The TypeError indicates that numpy does not support boolean subtraction, suggesting a need to handle boolean data differently when setting up scales. Given this context, the relevant code spans can be found in the `seaborn/_core/scales.py` file, which includes the `ContinuousBase._setup` method that needs to be adjusted to accommodate boolean data transformation.",
