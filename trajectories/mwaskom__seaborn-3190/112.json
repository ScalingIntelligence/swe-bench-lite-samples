The error traceback points to several key areas in the codebase that may be relevant:\n\n1. The location of the error in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` at line 841 within the `Plot._plot` method where `plotter._setup_scales` is called.\n2. Further down the traceback, in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` at line 1252 within the `Plotter._setup_scales` method, where `self._scales[var] = scale._setup(var_df[var], prop)` is executed.\n3. Finally, in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` at line 351 within the `ContinuousBase._setup` method, `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` where the TypeError is ultimately raised.\n\nFrom the search results, we can identify several relevant code spans:\n\n- In `seaborn/_core/plot.py`, there are code spans for the `Plot` and `Plotter._setup_scales` methods which directly correspond to the locations mentioned in the error traceback.\n- In `seaborn/_core/scales.py`, there are code spans for `ContinuousBase` and `Continuous` which are likely where the handling of continuous data types, including the problematic boolean data type, is implemented.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they involve the core functionalities (`Plot` and `Plotter`) and the specific handling of data types and scales (`ContinuousBase`).
