The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `Plotter._setup_scales` method within the `seaborn/_core/plot.py` file, specifically while setting up scales for the 'color' variable. This suggests that the 'Color' class in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` and the related scaling functions in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` are critical. Additionally, the `Bar` and `Bars` classes in `seaborn/_marks/bar.py` are likely involved as they handle plotting tasks that might interact with color mappings.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the failure of color mapping when using boolean data. This is evidenced by a `TypeError` encountered when attempting to use boolean values for the `color` parameter in a `so.Plot` instance. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `_setup_scales` method of the `Plotter` class, specifically when calling `scale._setup`. This suggests a deeper investigation into how boolean data is handled in the context of color mapping and scaling.\n\nThe relevant files and code spans are primarily in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` and `seaborn/_core/properties.py`. In `_core/plot.py`, the `Plotter._setup_scales` method is directly implicated in the error, and it interacts with `seaborn/_core/properties.py`, particularly the `Color` class and its methods (`infer_scale` and `get_mapping`).\n\nAnalyzing the code in `seaborn/_core/properties.py`: When handling boolean data in `Color.infer_scale`, it converts boolean types into 'categorical'. However, it appears not to have specific handling for boolean subsets (True, False), which might lead to inconsistencies when boolean data is involved. This could explain why there is no direct pathway for handling subtraction of boolean types within color mapping.\n\nThis assessment requires a deeper inspection but suggests changes in the handling of boolean scales or an overhaul to reconsider how scale setup specifically interacts with boolean data types.\n\nThe following code spans related to the issue:\n- In `_core/properties.py`: `Color.infer_scale` (ID: 'Color.infer_scale') demonstrates how boolean types escalate to 'categorical', but certain errors might imply procedural gaps with how boolean values are then computed inside the scale mapping setting.\n- Also in `_core/properties.py`: `Color.get_mapping` (ID: 'Color.get_mapping') outlines how mappings are generated according to scale type, offering a detailed look into potential interaction issues with boolean data.\n- Checking the code block under `_core/plot.py` with `Plotter._setup_scales` (ID: 'Plotter._setup_scales') is crucial as this is the direct contact point with an observed error, and reviewing the underlying code within could reveal disposable error contexts.",
