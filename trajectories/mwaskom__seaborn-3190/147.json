Additionally, the entire `ContinuousBase` class is important to understand the context and implementation of the `_setup` method. The `Continuous` and `Temporal` classes, which inherit from `ContinuousBase`, are also included for completeness, as they may be impacted by changes to `ContinuousBase`.
