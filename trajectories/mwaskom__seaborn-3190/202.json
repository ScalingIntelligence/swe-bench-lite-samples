This error occurs in the '_setup_scales' method of the 'Plotter' class within 'seaborn/_core/plot.py'. The error suggests that numpy's boolean subtraction is not supported, and the code does not currently handle boolean types properly. The relevant code spans for this issue include the 'Plotter._setup_scales' method where the error occurs and the 'ContinuousBase._setup' method in 'seaborn/_core/scales.py' where the boolean data is processed. These spans encompass the code that initializes scales and sets up data transformations, which need to be adjusted to handle boolean data correctly.\n\nTo solve the issue, the relevant spans to modify are those that handle data transformation and scaling. Specifically, the parts of the code identified with span IDs 'Plotter._setup_scales' and 'ContinuousBase._setup' need to be updated to handle boolean data differently, such as by converting boolean values to integers before performing arithmetic operations or using a different method entirely for boolean subtraction. The other identified code spans serve as context for understanding how the Plotter class and its components interact, but direct modifications to them are not strictly necessary for fixing the underlying issue.",
