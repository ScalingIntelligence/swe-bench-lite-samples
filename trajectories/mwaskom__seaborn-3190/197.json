            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a TypeError encountered when attempting to map colors with boolean data in a plot. The error occurs in the ContinuousBase class within the seaborn/_core/scales.py file, specifically in the '_setup' method where a boolean subtraction operation is attempted. The relevant code spans are identified as those containing the implementation of the ContinuousBase class and the '_setup' method, where the error is triggered. Additionally, the seaborn/_core/plot.py file contains the higher-level plot manipulation code that calls into the scales setup process, including the Plot and Plotter classes which orchestrate the plotting and setups of scales. These higher-level processes are essential as they set up the context in which the scale operations are performed and are therefore relevant for understanding and addressing the issue at a broader level. However, a key component that is currently missing relates to the 'forward' function, which is used in the '_setup' method but is not expanded upon in the provided search results. This function's role in converting data values before the problematic subtraction is crucial to fully resolve the issue. Despite this, from the given code spans, it is evident that the main problem resides within the ContinuousBase class's '_setup' method, where the boolean subtraction operation is directly related to the reported TypeError. Yet, without the explicit details of the 'forward' function, the remediation steps might be limited in scope to modifying the '_setup' method itself to prevent boolean subtraction in contexts where it is not supported. Though this omission does not invalidate the significance of the already identified code segments, it underscores the need for those tasked with subsequent steps to either acquire further code details or make assumptions necessary to proceed with adjustments to the '_setup' method.\n\nThe search results are sufficiently relevant to the reported issue and present the essential elements of the code responsible for setting up scales that ultimately lead to the TypeError with boolean data. The provided code highlights logical and functional components key to understanding how scale setup in Seaborn reacts to user inputs and incompatible operations. Despite the lack of the 'forward' function's definition, the identified code segments provide a foundation for the subsequent steps to troubleshoot or modify in line with resolving operation incompatibilities during the plotting process when boolean data is involved.",
