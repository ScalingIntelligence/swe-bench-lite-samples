The traceback points to an error in the `_setup_scales` method within the `Plotter` class in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`, where a TypeError is raised when attempting to subtract two boolean values. This suggests that the handling of boolean data in color mapping or scale setup might be the root cause. Relevant files include those dealing with plotting logic (e.g., `seaborn/_core/plot.py`, `seaborn/_marks/bar.py`), scale and property handling (e.g., `seaborn/_core/scales.py`, `seaborn/_core/properties.py`), and compatibility issues (`seaborn/_compat.py`). A targeted search should focus on the specific sections of these files where boolean data handling or color mapping is involved.",
