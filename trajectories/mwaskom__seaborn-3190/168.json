Furthermore, inspecting subclasses of `ContinuousBase` like `Continuous` and `Temporal` can offer insights into how specific data types are handled differently.

This includes handling different types of data, including boolean data.\n   - The 'Color._get_categorical_mapping' span where categorical color mapping is handled. This is especially relevant for boolean data since boolean can be treated as a categorical variable with two levels.\n2. In seaborn/_oldcore.py:\n   - The 'HueMapping.categorical_mapping' span where categorically mapped hues are handled. This could be relevant for handling boolean data if it is treated as a categorical type.\n3. In seaborn/_core/scales.py:\n   - The 'ContinuousBase._setup' span where continuous scales are set up. This includes the handling of data normalization, which could be relevant for boolean data if it is aligned on a continuous spectrum.\n   - The 'Continuous.tick' and 'Continuous.label' spans, which are related to the setup and formatting of continuous scales.

The '_setup' method is responsible for setting up the scale before plotting, which directly relates to the reported issue about color mapping failing with boolean data. Additionally, subclasses of 'ContinuousBase' like 'Continuous' and 'Temporal' are also present in the file context, providing a comprehensive view of how data types are handled within the class hierarchy related to scales. Furthermore, the 'Color' class within 'seaborn/_core/properties.py' is relevant as it handles color mappings for plots, suggesting it's part of the broader context for resolving the issue. Overall, the file context provided is sufficient to address the reported issue involving color mapping with boolean data.",
