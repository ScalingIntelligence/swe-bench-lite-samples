The error stack trace indicates that the error originates from the `Plotter._setup_scales` method in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`, specifically when setting up scales for color variables. This method attempts to set up a scale for the color variable, which leads to the error when handling boolean data. The boolean data is likely causing issues in the normalization process within the `ContinuousBase._setup` method in `seaborn/_core/scales.py`. Given the relevance of the reported issue, it is crucial to focus on the methods `Plotter._setup_scales` and `ContinuousBase._setup`. Additionally, since the color mapping involves the `Color` class in `seaborn/_core/properties.py`, it is essential to ensure that this class correctly handles boolean data as categorical data, not continuous or numeric data.

The traceback indicates the error is triggered when the 'color' parameter is set to a list of boolean values. The code analysis points to the '_setup' method where the problematic line 'b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)' attempts to subtract boolean values, which is unsupported in numpy. The issue lies in how boolean data is handled without proper conversion or appropriate type checks before performing arithmetic operations. The search results align with this analysis by including the relevant 'ContinuousBase._setup' method and related Scale class definitions that establish the framework for data scaling and transformation.
