This error occurs in the `ContinuousBase._setup` method within the `seaborn/_core/scales.py` file. The traceback points directly to this method, specifically at the line where `forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` is attempted. Upon examining the `ContinuousBase` class and its `_setup` method, it is evident that there is a need to handle boolean data appropriately to avoid such type errors. The method currently does not have specific checks for boolean data types, which is likely causing the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those within the `ContinuousBase._setup` method that handle data normalization and transformation, particularly where boolean subtraction is attempted.
