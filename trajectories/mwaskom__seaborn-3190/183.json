The error message indicates that a subtraction operation involving boolean types is not supported. This suggests that the problem might be within the logic handling color mapping or data normalization for plotting. Given the context, the primary focus should be on the `Plotter` class and how it sets up scales, as well as the `Color` property class which manages color mapping. Additionally, the error occurs when setting up scales in the `Plotter` class, so specific attention should be given to the `_setup_scales` method and any related functions or classes handling data transformations or type checks.",

The traceback points to the `Plotter._setup_scales` and `ContinuousBase._setup` methods in the `seaborn/_core/plot.py` and `seaborn/_core/scales.py` files, respectively. These methods are responsible for setting up scales for plot variables, including color. The error occurs specifically when trying to subtract two boolean values in the `ContinuousBase._setup` method, which is not allowed in NumPy. To address this issue, we need to examine how boolean data is being handled in these methods and potentially modify the logic to handle boolean data differently or convert it to a supported type before performing arithmetic operations. The relevant code spans include the `Plotter._setup_scales` and `ContinuousBase._setup` methods, as well as any associated methods or properties in the `Color` class in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` that may be implicated in the color mapping process.",
