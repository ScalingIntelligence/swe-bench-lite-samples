Given the traceback, the error occurs in the `_setup_scales` method of the `Plotter` class in the `plot.py` file. The relevant code snippet provided indicates that the problem arises when setting up scales for a continuous variable with boolean data. The error message suggests a direct involvement of the `ContinuousBase` class in `scales.py`. Additionally, the `Color` and `Fill` properties in `properties.py` might also play a role as they infer scale and get mappings, which could potentially standardize color data. Therefore, the search should focus on these classes and methods, especially around handling boolean data.",
