The traceback points to the location in the code where the error occurs: `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)`. Given this context, the relevant code spans would be those involved in the setup and handling of scales, especially the `ContinuousBase._setup` method since it deals directly with normalizing data, which might cause the boolean subtraction issue if boolean data is involved. Additionally, `Plotter._setup_scales` in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` would also be relevant because it calls the scale setup method that eventually leads to the error. Furthermore, the `Color` class in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` deserves a look because it's associated with color mapping properties that could interact with the scale setup. Thus, I will select these spans to provide deeper insight into where the boolean data handling might be breaking the code.",
