This method is responsible for setting up scales for different variables, including handling color data. The specific error arises when trying to subtract boolean values using the `-` operator, which is not supported by numpy for boolean types. This suggests that the method does not properly handle boolean data types during the scale setup process. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans for the `Plotter._setup_scales` method, which includes the logic for setting up scales and handling data types. These code spans are the most relevant to the reported issue as they directly relate to the processing of data and the setting up of scales during plotting.
