The traceback indicates the error occurs in the ContinuousBase class within the _setup method of the seaborn._core.scales module. The error specifically arises from a numpy boolean subtraction operation failure. This suggests a deeper look into how boolean data is handled in the ContinuousBase class and its parent Scale class, particularly within the _setup method, is needed. Additionally, examining the Color and Fill classes in the seaborn._core.properties module might provide further insights into boolean data handling for color mapping. Also, the Plotter class in seaborn._core.plot might be involved in the color setup for plotting.",

This is evident through the 'variable_type' function in seaborn._core.rules which returns 'categorical' for boolean data, leading the infer_scale method in the Color class to return a Nominal scale. Consequently, when the Plotter class's _setup_scales method calls the _setup method on this Nominal scale, it assumes that all data being passed to it is categorical, rather than possibly numeric. This mismatch in expectations can lead to issues if the subsequent code within the Plotter class or its dependent methods assume that the data is purely numeric. In the ContinuousBase class within seaborn._core.scales.py, the _setup method uses numpy operations that are not suitable for boolean data, such as subtraction where the error specifically occurs. This indicates a need to handle boolean data distinctly or convert it appropriately before applying numeric operations. The code review suggests that there might not be explicit checks for boolean data type before applying numeric operations in the _setup method of the ContinuousBase class, leading to the type error when attempting to subtract boolean values.",
