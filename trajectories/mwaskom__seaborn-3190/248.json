This indicates that there's a problem with how the ContinuousBase class is handling boolean data types during the setup of scales. Digging into the provided 'ContinuousBase._setup' span, we see that it processes data for plotting, including normalization steps that involve arithmetic operations which are not supported for boolean types in numpy. Hence, the identified span directly relates to the reported issue, as it contains the specific code causing the TypeError. The 'Plotter._setup_scales' method in 'seaborn/_core/plot.py' also appears relevant as it calls '_setup' on scales, indicating it plays a role in the process leading up to the error.
