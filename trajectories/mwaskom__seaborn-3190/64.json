The error trace points to specific methods in the seaborn library related to scaling and plotting. In the provided search results, two main components stand out: the `Plot` class and the `Plotter` class, particularly the `_setup_scales` method within the `Plotter` class. These are central to the plotting and scaling processes, closely aligning with the error trace. The `Plot` class initializes and manages plot data, layers, scales, and other plot attributes. The `Plotter._setup_scales` method is crucial as it sets up scales for the plot, processing variables and assigning them appropriate scales. This method directly involves the scaling of data, making it a focal point for addressing the issue since the error occurs during this phase. This section of the code is responsible for handling data and determining the appropriate scales, which is directly relevant to the reported issue.

Specifically, the `_setup_scales` method in the `Plotter` class is involved in setting up scales for variables, which is directly related to the issue of color mapping failing with boolean data. Similarly, the `_get_scale` method in the `Scale` class and the `Color` class in `properties.py` are relevant as they pertain to scaling and color handling, respectively.
