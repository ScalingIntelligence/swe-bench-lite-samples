The traceback points to a few specific areas in the code where the error occurs: in `Plot._plot` at `_setup_scales`, and in `Plotter._setup_scales` with a call to `scale._setup`. These areas are critical because they handle the setup and computation of scales which are integral to mapping colors in a plot.\n\nThe search results provided include several key sections of the code, particularly the `Plot`, `Plot.__init__`, `Plot._plot`, `Plotter`, `Plotter.__init__`, and `Plotter._setup_scales` spans. These spans contain the logic for initializing plots, handling data, and setting up scales, exactly where the reported issue is occurring.\n\nThe `Plot._plot` span directly correlates with the traceback, showing the call to `_setup_scales`. The `Plotter._setup_scales` span is also highly relevant as it contains the logic for setting up scales and handling variables which could be causing the boolean data error. Both of these spans are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue.\n\nGiven the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue, they are identified as relevant.",
