The traceback indicates a TypeError specifically mentioning 'numpy boolean subtract, the `-` operator, is not supported'. This error is raised from within the `_setup_scales` method of the `Plotter` class in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`, inside the `_setup` method of a `ContinuousBase` class (likely from `seaborn/_core/scales.py`). To address this issue, we need to identify the code responsible for handling color mappings, especially where boolean data might be involved. The analysis of the provided search results shows relevant code spans in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` and `seaborn/_core/plot.py`. In `properties.py`, the `Color` class and its methods (`standardize`, `infer_scale`, `_get_categorical_mapping`, and `get_mapping`) deal with color specifications and their scale inference, which is crucial for handling different types of data, including booleans. The `Plotter` class and its methods (`_setup_scales`, `_get_scale`, and `_get_subplot_data`) in `plot.py` are also relevant as they handle the setting up of scales which is where the error occurs. These spans are therefore identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
