Specifically, the error arises when calling the `_setup` method of the `ContinuousBase` class in the `_core/scales.py` file, where a boolean subtraction operation is attempted. To address this issue, it is necessary to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the scale setup for color mappings, particularly where boolean data is processed. The search results include several key spans: `Plotter._setup_scales` in `_core/plot.py` handles the setup of scales, including color scales, and will likely need adjustments. `ContinuousBase._setup` in `_core/scales.py` processes the setup for continuous scales and may need to handle boolean data differently to avoid the TypeError. Additionally, `Color.infer_scale` and `Color.get_mapping` in `_core/properties.py` are relevant as they infer and map color scales, which could also play a role in how boolean data is treated for color mapping.",
