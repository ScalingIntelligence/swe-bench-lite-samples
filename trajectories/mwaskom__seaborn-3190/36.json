The traceback points to the _setup_scales method in the Plotter class within seaborn/_core/plot.py, specifically at line 1252, where the scale setup fails due to a boolean subtraction error. This error suggests that the code does not adequately handle boolean data types in its scaling logic. To address this, it's essential to focus on the sections of the code involved in handling data types for scaling, particularly where boolean data might be processed. The provided search results include the Plotter class and its _setup_scales method, which directly relate to the scaling setup mentioned in the traceback. This code snippet is critical because it contains the logic that prepares scales for plotting based on the data types of the variables involved. It's clear from the method that it processes various types of data and sets up scales accordingly. The specific line where the error occurs (_scales[var] = scale._setup(var_df[var], prop)) indicates that the method is trying to set up a scale for the variable that contains boolean data, which leads to the TypeError. Thus, these sections are directly relevant to resolving the issue and ensuring proper handling of boolean data during scale setup.",
