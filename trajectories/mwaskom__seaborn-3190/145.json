The traceback indicates that the error originates from the `_setup` method in the `ContinuousBase` class within `seaborn/_core/scales.py`, specifically at line 351 where a subtraction operation between the results of the `forward` method is attempted. This operation fails because numpy does not support boolean subtraction directly. The relevant code spans should include the `_setup` method in `seaborn/_core/scales.py` and any related methods in `seaborn/_core/properties.py` that handle color mapping, notably the `Color` class and its methods. Additionally, the `Plotter` class in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` is relevant as it calls the `_setup_scales` method, which in turn uses the `_setup` method from scales. It is crucial to ensure that the color mapping logic correctly handles boolean data types to prevent such errors. The identified spans should help in diagnosing and fixing the issue.",
