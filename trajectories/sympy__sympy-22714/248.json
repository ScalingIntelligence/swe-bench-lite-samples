The crash occurs due to the ValueError 'Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.'. This suggests a deep dive into the `Point` class's `__new__` method and the `Point2D` class, as well as the `parse_expr` function in the `sympy_parser` module handling the evaluation flag. Both `Point.__new__` and `parse_expr` validate coordinates and handle evaluation differently. The `parse_expr` function is crucial for understanding how the evaluation flag is processed and how it affects the evaluation of expressions. The `Point.__new__` method directly raises the ValueError if imaginary coordinates are detected, which fits the reported issue. By examining these sections of code, we can trace the exact conditions under which the issue occurs.",
