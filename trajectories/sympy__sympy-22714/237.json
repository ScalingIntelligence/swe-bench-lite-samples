The `evaluate` parameter is part of the `sympify` function definition, directly linking to the context of the issue.\n\n2. **sympy/geometry/point.py**: This file defines the `Point` class and includes the method where the `ValueError` occurs (`Point.__new__`). This is where the validation of coordinates happens, including the check for imaginary numbers, which is directly tied to the error in the reported issue.\n\n3. **sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py**: Here, the `parse_expr` function, which includes the `evaluate` parameter, is found and is likely where the code enters during the `with evaluate(False)` context. This function is crucial for understanding how SymPy converts string inputs into expressions and manages evaluation.\n\nThese code spans collectively cover the entire path from input parsing and sympification to the point creation and the subsequent validation that fails, making all of them relevant to addressing the reported issue.\n\nGiven all necessary functions and classes related to the issue are contained within the extracted code spans, this fulfills the request for relevant code snippets.",
