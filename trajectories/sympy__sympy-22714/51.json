The error occurs because the coordinates passed to `Point2D` are not correctly handled when evaluation is suppressed. To address this, we need to locate the code where the `ValueError` is raised during the instantiation of `Point2D` and ensure proper handling or transformation of coordinates in the `with evaluate(False)` context. Additionally, investigate how the state of evaluation affects the sympification process and coordinate validation.",
