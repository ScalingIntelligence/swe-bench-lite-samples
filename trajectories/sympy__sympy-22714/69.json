This suggests a problem in the evaluation context handling specifically for Point2D. The relevant files identified so far include `sympy/core/sympify.py`, `sympy/geometry/point.py`, and `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`. Notably, `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` contains the `parse_expr` function which is central to the sympification process and evaluation handling. Additionally, `sympy/core/parameters.py` has the `evaluate` context manager that sets the evaluation state, which might interfere with how `Point2D` is instantiated. Given the involved components, further investigation is needed in `sympy/geometry/point.py` to understand how the Point class handles new instances and coordinates, especially under non-evaluation conditions, to pinpoint the cause of this error.",

The `Point.__new__` method contains the code that raises the `ValueError: Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.` error, which matches the error reported in the issue.\n- In `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, the `parse_expr` and `eval_expr` spans are relevant as they are responsible for parsing and evaluating expressions, which is a key part of the context where the issue arises.\n- In `sympy/core/parameters.py`, the `evaluate` span is relevant as it defines the `evaluate` context manager, which is the context under which the issue arises.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided search results, the identified spans should include those that directly deal with the instantiation of `Point2D` and the parsing and evaluation of expressions, as well as those related to the `evaluate` context manager.
