This method attempts to create a new instance of `Point2D` and raises a `ValueError` if the coordinates are imaginary. Additionally, the code uses `sympify` from `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which is involved in converting the input into a SymPy object. This function has an `evaluate` parameter that can be set to `False`, which might be causing the issue when combined with `Point2D`. The `evaluate` context manager in `sympy/core/parameters.py` is also relevant as it sets the global evaluation flag, which affects how expressions are simplified.
