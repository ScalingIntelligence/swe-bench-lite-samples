This problem seems to be primarily centered around the sympify function and how the evaluate context affects it. The error traceback shows the ValueError originating from the `Point` class in the `geometry/point.py` file. Further investigation should focus on ensuring that the `sympify` function, specifically in the context of `evaluate(False)`, properly handles the conversion and evaluation of input expressions without leading to invalid states or imaginary coordinates.
