The issue seems to be triggered by the interaction between the `sympify` function's evaluation control and the `Point2D` class. The provided search results include several key files and spans that are likely relevant to understanding and addressing this issue:\n1. `sympify` in `sympy/core/sympify.py` - This function is central to the sympification process, and the span includes logic related to the evaluation flag.\n2. `Point` and `Point2D` in `sympy/geometry/point.py` - These classes handle point creation and validation. The error 'Imaginary coordinates are not permitted' is raised in the `Point.__new__` method, emphasizing its relevance. `Point2D.__new__` specifically manages the creation of 2D points, linking it directly to the issue.\n3. `parse_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` - This function handles the parsing of expressions with control over evaluation, relevant due to the evaluate flag in the issue context.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the most relevant spans are those dealing directly with evaluation control (`sympify.syypify`, `parse_expr.parse_expr`), point validation (`Point.Point.__new__`), and 2D point creation (`Point2D.Point2D.__new__`).
