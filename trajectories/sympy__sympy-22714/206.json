The primary areas of interest are: 1. `sympify` function in `sympy.core.sympify.py` for handling the evaluate argument. 2. The `Point` class and its `__new__` method in `sympy.geometry.point.py` for the error related to imaginary coordinates. 3. The `parse_expr` function in `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser.py` for how expressions are parsed and evaluated. \nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are: \n1. The `sympify` function definition which includes handling of the `evaluate` argument. \n2. The `Point.__new__` method where the error 'Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.' is raised. \n3. The `parse_expr` function which is involved in parsing and possibly evaluating the expression at fault.",
