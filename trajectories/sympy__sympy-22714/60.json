The error occurs during the sympification process, specifically in the `__new__` method of the `Point` class in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. This could be due to how the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` handles the `evaluate` parameter. We also saw relevant code in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` and `sympy/core/parameters.py` that might be involved in enforcing evaluation conditions.

In `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the `Point2D.__new__` method delegates coordinate handling to the `Point` class constructor via `args = Point(*args, **kwargs)`. This implies that the `Point` class's `__new__` method is responsible for evaluating coordinates, and if they are imaginary, it raises the `ValueError: Imaginary coordinates are not permitted`.\n\nGiven that `evaluate=False` should prevent evaluation, there might be a misalignment in how the `sympify` function and the `Point` class's `__new__` method are handling this parameter. Specifically, `sympy/core/sympify.py` uses the `evaluate` parameter to control the evaluation during sympification, but the `Point` class might be performing unnecessary evaluations even when `evaluate=False`.\n\nAdditionally, in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`, the `parse_expr` function respects the `evaluate` parameter by compiling the expression with `evaluateFalse` if `evaluate=False`. However, if there's an error during this process, it might bypass the intended suppression of evaluation, leading to the observed error with imaginary coordinates.\n\nTo address this, further investigation should focus on ensuring that the `Point` class properly respects the `evaluate` flag during coordinate checks in its `__new__` method. Additionally, reviewing how errors during the `parse_expr` process might inadvertently lead to evaluation could uncover the underlying issue.",

This involves understanding how `evaluate(False)` affects the `sympify` function and the `Point` class within the `geometry` module. The key elements to look for are the handling of the `evaluate` parameter in both `sympify` and `Point`'s creation method, which might be affected by or affect the imaginary coordinate check. The current `file_context` includes relevant portions from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/sympify.py`, focusing on `Point2D`, `Point`, and the `sympify` function. The new `search_results` contain additional relevant code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/sympify.py` that elaborate on the `Point` class and its handling of the `evaluate` parameter. Notably, the `Point.__new__` method has a detailed check for imaginary coordinates and how it interacts with the `evaluate` parameter. This information, along with the handling of the `evaluate` parameter in `sympify`, should provide a comprehensive understanding of why the `with evaluate(False)` context might cause the crash, potentially due to how it bypasses or alters expected evaluation checks during the creation of a `Point` or `Point2D` object.",
