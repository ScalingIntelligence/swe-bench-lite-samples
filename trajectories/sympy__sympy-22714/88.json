Additionally, the issue involves the `Point2D` class, which is a subclass of `Point` and interacts with it. \n\nThe specific parts of the code under `Point.__new__` are of particular interest because they constitute the error-checking conditions that are causing the reported issue. Furthermore, given the context provided in the search results, it is clear that the issue is related to evaluation flag handling, especially when it is set to False.

These sections are crucial as they handle the creation and validation of point objects, including checking for imaginary coordinates.\n\nIn the new search results, `sympy/core/sympify.py` is significant because it contains the `sympify` function, which is directly invoked in the provided code snippet (e.g., `sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))')`). This function is responsible for converting non-SymPy objects into SymPy objects, potentially invoking further functions like `Point.__new__`.\n\nWithin the `sympy/geometry/point.py` search results, the additional methods (like `__contains__`, `__truediv__`, `__eq__`, etc.) do not directly relate to the issue at hand. The critical section remains `Point.__new__`, which was already identified in the file context. This method is where the validation of coordinates, including the check for imaginary coordinates, occurs.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans should include the `sympify` function from `sympy/core/sympify.py` and the `Point.__new__` method from `sympy/geometry/point.py`. These sections directly address the issue of handling evaluations (with/without `evaluate=False`) and validating point coordinates, respectively.",
