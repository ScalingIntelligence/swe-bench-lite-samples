The error message indicates that imaginary coordinates are not permitted, which suggests there might be a problem with how coordinates are handled within the `Point2D` class or during the sympification process.

Additionally, the parsing and evaluation logic in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` should be inspected for handling `evaluate=False` cases.",
