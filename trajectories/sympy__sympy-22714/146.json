These are the key areas to focus on for identifying the relevant code spans. Given that the issue is about imaginary coordinates not being permitted in `Point2D`, it's crucial to look at the code where this validation occurs. The search results provide sections of the `sympify` function, the `evaluate` context manager, and the `Point` and `Point2D` classes.

From the provided context and search results, several key points are identified:\n\n1. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` processes the input and triggers the evaluation, which seems to be relevant because it's where the code execution starts to diverge.\n2. The `evaluate` context manager in `sympy/core/parameters.py` is used to control the evaluation behavior, which is directly related to the issue.\n3. The `__new__` method in both `Point` and `Point2D` classes is crucial as it's where the imaginary coordinate check and potentially the crash occur.\n\nAnalyzing the new search results:\n\n- The `Point.__new__` method contains the validation for imaginary coordinates and sets the evaluation behavior. This method is central to understanding how the coordinates are processed and why the error might be triggered.\n- The `Point2D.__new__` method is also relevant as it inherits from `Point` and explicitly deals with 2D points, which is directly linked to the issue with `Point2D`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans include the `Point.__new__` and `Point2D.__new__` methods as they are directly involved in handling the coordinates and evaluation that lead to the error. The context manager `evaluate` is also necessary to understand how evaluation settings affect the behavior of these methods.",
