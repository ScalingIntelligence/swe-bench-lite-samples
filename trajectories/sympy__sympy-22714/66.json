The error pertains to imaginary coordinates not being permitted. To address this issue, it's crucial to understand the involved code spans that handle the `Point2D` class and the `sympify` function, responsible for converting input to a SymPy expression with optional evaluation control.\n\nFirst, the `Point2D` class definition and its method `__new__` should be examined since this is where the error is raised regarding imaginary coordinates. This method is likely where the input checking or transformation causing the issue occurs.\n\nSecond, the `sympify` function is critical as it converts strings to SymPy expressions and handles the evaluation setting. The provided code span shows how the `sympify` function deals with conversion and evaluation, which might influence how `Point2D` is instantiated or processed.\n\nBy focusing on these specific sections of the code, we can determine the root cause of the issue and identify the most relevant parts.\n\nThe `Point2D.__new__` span is crucial because it constructs the `Point2D` object and checks for valid input parameters. The `sympify` span is relevant for understanding how the evaluation context is handled and how expressions are parsed and instantiated.

Additionally, the `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` contains various methods related to expression evaluation, which might also be relevant.
