This could be related to how the `Point2D` class handles coordinate validation or how `evaluate(False)` context is being managed within the codebase. A likely candidate for investigation is the `Point` class constructor (as `Point2D` inherits from `Point`), especially focusing on the coordinate validation logic. Additionally, the `sympify` function, which is involved in the conversion process, and the `parse_expr` function in the `sympy_parser` module, which handles expression parsing, should also be reviewed for potential issues related to the evaluation context.",

The error message indicates that imaginary coordinates are not permitted, which leads to the crash. The analysis of the search results reveals several key pieces of code that are likely relevant to the issue:\n\n1. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is critical as it is the entry point for converting Python objects to SymPy objects. The `sympify` function includes handling for the `evaluate` parameter, which is central to the issue.\n\n2. The `parse_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` is responsible for parsing and evaluating expressions, including the option to control evaluation. This function is likely where the evaluation context (`evaluate=False`) is managed.\n\n3. The `Point` class and its `__new__` method in `sympy/geometry/point.py` are relevant because this is where the error related to imaginary coordinates is raised. Understanding how coordinates are processed and validated in this class is crucial to resolve the issue.\n\nThese three sections of code, along with the `parse_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/ast_parser.py`, provide a comprehensive view of the code involved in the sympification and evaluation process, as well as the handling of geometric points. This should be sufficient to investigate and potentially resolve the issue related to imaginary coordinates not being permitted when using `with evaluate(False)`.",
