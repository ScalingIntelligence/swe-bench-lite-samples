This method is also responsible for the evaluation of the coordinates. \n- Additionally, the `__new__` method of the `Point2D` class is relevant as it inherits from `Point` and is directly involved in the creation of `Point2D` instances. \n- The `eval_expr` and `parse_expr` functions in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` are also relevant as they are part of the evaluation process and might be related to how the `evaluate` context is handled.\n\nBased on this analysis, the search task appears to be complete as the identified code spans cover the main areas related to the reported issue.",
