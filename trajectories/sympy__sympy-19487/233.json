The 'sign' class defines the behavior of the 'sign' function, and the 'Abs' class defines the behavior of the 'Abs' function. Specifically, the 'eval' methods in both classes are essential for understanding how the functions behave and how they might be rewritten in terms of each other. The 'eval' method in 'sign' deals with the evaluation of the function based on the properties of the argument, which includes handling cases for zero, positive, and negative values. The 'eval' method in 'Abs' handles the absolute value computation and includes specific cases for handling complex numbers and their magnitudes. These methods are crucial for implementing the rewrite of 'sign' in terms of 'Abs'. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

The 'Abs' function is also defined within the same context but there isn't any direct implementation of rewriting the 'sign' function in terms of 'Abs'. However, I see potential places where this could be implemented, such as the 'eval' class method in the 'sign' function class or the 'rewrite' method for 'sign'. The issue points out handling of zero values: this is currently implemented with `if arg.is_zero: return S.Zero` in the 'sign' class's 'eval' method, which differs from the `nan` suggested in the issue for `Abs(0)`. Due to the precision of this task, I would suggest digging deeper into potential rewrite methods for the 'sign' function or searching how SymPy handles similar rewrites to better understand where this may fit in.",

The issue also discusses handling the case where `z` is zero, suggesting that `sign(0)` might need to be `nan` if `0 / Abs(0)` returns `nan`.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, several relevant code spans have been identified:\n1. The `sign` class definition and its `eval` method, which handles various cases including zero, positive, and negative values.\n2. The `Abs` class definition and its methods, particularly `eval` and `fdiff`, which are involved in processing the absolute value of expressions.\n3. The `sign._eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` and `sign._eval_rewrite_as_Heaviside` methods, which suggest there might be rewrites of `sign` in terms of other functions (\"Piecewise\" in this case).\n\nGiven the task to rewrite `sign` in terms of `Abs`, it's important to consider adding or modifying the `sign._eval_rewrite_to_Abs` method. While such a method doesn't exist in the provided context, it would be a key element to resolve the reported issue. Therefore, the task is not yet complete but requires the addition of this functionality to handle the rewrite of `sign` to `Abs`.\n\nThe focus should be on developing this missing method to handle the conversion of `sign` into `Abs` and ensuring that it correctly manages edge cases, particularly when the argument is zero. The existing code spans for both `sign` and `Abs` can serve as a foundation for this implementation.",

To implement a rewrite of 'sign' in terms of 'Abs', we can consider following the patterns used in the 'Abs' class, which does have a 'rewrite' method. Specifically, we should focus on the 'rewrite' methods within the 'Abs' class to understand how to handle rewrites and then apply a similar structure to the 'sign' function. Given the existing file context, it appears that we need to implement a new 'rewrite' method within the 'sign' class targeting 'Abs'.
