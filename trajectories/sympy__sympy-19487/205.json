The focus should be on the `sign` class within the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file to ensure that the rewrite method is implemented correctly, considering the treatment of zero as an edge case. Additionally, the `sign` method in `sympy/printing/fcode.py` might be relevant for the rewriting process. Though not explicitly mentioned, the `refine_sign` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, which might handle sign simplification under certain assumptions, could also be considered for potential connections or implications related to this rewrite functionality.",

I've analyzed the provided code spans across different files.\n\nIn `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, several code spans are relevant:\n- `sign.doit`: Defines how the sign function behaves when applied, directly related to the issue.\n- `sign.eval`: Contains the logic for evaluating the sign function for different types of arguments, which is directly relevant to the issue, especially the handling of zero.\n- `Abs.fdiff`: Although this is in the Abs class, it uses the `sign` function in its definition, showing an interaction between `sign` and `Abs`. This is relevant as understanding this relationship could help in rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.\n\nIn `sympy/printing/fcode.py`, there is:\n- `FCodePrinter._print_sign`: This method prints the `sign` function in a specific format, using `Abs`, which could be relevant for understanding how `sign` is utilized in different contexts.\n\nIn `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, there is:\n- `refine_sign`: This function refines the sign of an expression based on assumptions. It checks if the argument is zero, positive, or negative and returns accordingly. This is highly relevant as it tackles the specific case of zero in the `sign` function.\n\nBased on these findings, the code spans identified are relevant to resolving the reported issue, providing a comprehensive view of the `sign` function's current implementations and its interactions with `Abs`.",
