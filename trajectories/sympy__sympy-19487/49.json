In `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, the `sign` class definition and its methods such as `doit` and `eval` are found, which directly deal with the computation of the sign function and its behavior for different argument types. Additionally, the `Abs` class and its methods like `eval` and `fdiff` are also relevant as they provide the necessary functionality to handle absolute values, which is central to rewriting the sign function. The `refine_sign` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` is also relevant as it refines the output of the sign function based on assumptions, which could be useful for handling edge cases like zero.

However, it does not explicitly handle the rewrite in terms of `Abs` for all cases, including when the argument is zero. The `doit` method of the `sign` class currently returns the same `sign` object when the argument is zero, rather than handling it as `nan` which may be more appropriate. Furthermore, the `Abs` class has methods for evaluation and differentiation, which could be relevant for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`. The `refine_sign` function in `refine.py` refines the `sign` function based on assumptions, which could also be a place to include the rewrite logic.",
