This involves both understanding how the current `sign` function works and identifying how to integrate `Abs` into its functionality. In the search results, we find multiple relevant code spans that deal with the `sign` and `Abs` functions directly. The `sign` function's `eval` method handles various cases including when the argument is zero, positive, or negative. The `Abs` function's `eval` method similarly handles expressions and includes a derivative method that returns `sign(self.args[0])`. Notably, the `_print_sign` method of the `FCodePrinter` class rewrites the `sign` function by using the `Abs` function in the context of Fortran code printing. These code spans are directly related to the task of redefining the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`. Furthermore, the issue of how to handle `sign(0)` is also addressed implicitly in the current `sign` function\u2019s `eval` method, where it returns `S.Zero` for zero arguments, which aligns with the current behavior described in the issue. This demonstrates that the existing code is already somewhat prepared for potential modifications. Given this analysis, the search task can be considered complete in terms of functionality related to `sign` and `Abs`, as all the significant parts of the code that might need adjustments are present and can guide the implementation of the requested change.",

I've examined the current context and found that there are already definitions for the `sign` and `Abs` functions. From the new search results, I focused on the `sign` and `Abs` functions as well as their interactions within their respective files. I noticed that `Abs.fdiff` and `Abs.eval` are relevant, as well as `sign.eval` and `sign._eval_conjugate`. The `sign.eval` method provides logic for handling various cases of the `sign` function's input, including zero, which should influence how `sign` is rewritten in terms of `Abs`. The goal is to identify and extract relevant code spans to help rewrite `sign` using `Abs`. There is also a need to handle the zero case appropriately. Based on this analysis, I will provide the identified relevant code spans.",

Additionally, the `Abs` class contains methods like `eval`, `fdiff`, `_eval_derivative`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_sign` which are crucial for handling the absolute value function.
