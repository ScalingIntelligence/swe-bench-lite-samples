The relevant files are likely to be those handling function definitions and rewrites, such as `functions/elementary/complexes.py`, which contains the definitions for both `sign` and `Abs`. Additionally, the `assumptions/refine.py` and `printing/fcode.py` files should be checked as they contain refinement and printing methods for the `sign` function. It's also important to understand how `sign(0)` should be handled, which might involve modifying the `eval` method of the `sign` class or handling it in the rewrite logic. The search should focus on these files and include specific targets like the `sign` and `Abs` classes, and potentially the `eval` and rewrite methods.",

These code spans are crucial to work on the rewrite. The provided code includes the definition of the `sign` function and its `eval` method, as well as the `refine_sign` function which is responsible for refining the `sign` function based on assumptions. The `sign.eval` span handles the evaluation of the `sign` function for various types of arguments including zero, positive, and negative values. The `refine_sign` span handles refining the `sign` function based on assumptions, including handling the case where the argument is zero. These spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue, as handling the zero case in both functions correctly is crucial for rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`.

Additionally, the 'sign.doit' method and the 'Abs.fdiff' method are particularly relevant as they show the relationship between 'sign' and 'Abs'. Further, the 'sign._eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise' method and the 'sign._eval_rewrite_as_Heaviside' method suggest how the 'sign' function might be rewritten in other contexts, potentially providing insights into how a rewrite in terms of 'Abs' might be structured.
