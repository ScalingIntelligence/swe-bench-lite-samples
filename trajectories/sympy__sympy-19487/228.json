The relevant files and methods have already been identified in the provided code snippets. The primary concern is defining the behavior of 'sign' when the argument is zero, which current implementations seem to handle differently. Therefore, the search should focus on the 'sign' and 'Abs' functions in the specified files. Additionally, understanding how the 'sign' function is rewritten in terms of other functions (like Heaviside) can provide insights into how it can be rewritten in terms of 'Abs'.",

The key elements to look for in the code are the definitions and behaviors of both `sign` and `Abs` functions, especially how they handle zero values. The code spans provided show the implementations of both functions and how they interact. The `sign.doit` method directly handles the non-zero case by returning `arg / Abs(arg)`, which aligns with the desired behavior. The `sign.eval` method also handles specific cases of the argument's value, including zero, but doesn't explicitly address the rewriting in terms of `Abs`. Regarding the zero case, the current behavior returns 0 for `sign(0)`, while the division by `Abs(0)` results in `nan`. The issue suggests that `sign(0)` might also need to be `nan` to make the rewrite behavior consistent. However, the provided code does not currently address this point directly. There are no additional references in the code to other parts of the codebase that might need consideration for this issue. Based on the information provided, the relevant code spans are those directly related to the `sign` function and its interaction with `Abs`, including `sign.doit`, `sign.eval`, and `Abs.fdiff`.",

  "initial_message": "Rewrite sign as abs\nIn sympy the `sign` function is defined as\r\n```\r\n    sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)\r\n```\r\nfor all complex non-zero `z`. There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                   \r\n x \r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\u2502x\u2502\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(0)                                                                                                                               \r\n0\r\n>>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                            \r\nnan\r\n```\r\nMaybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
