Since the `sign` function is defined for non-zero complex numbers as `z / Abs(z)`, the main concern is how to handle the case when `z` is zero. The current behavior is that `sign(0)` returns 0, but `0 / Abs(0)` returns `nan`. There might be a need to change the behavior of `sign(0)` to also return `nan` or handle the case differently. The search should focus on the `sign` function's implementation and related rewrites in SymPy's `functions` module, especially in the `complexes.py` file where the `sign` class is defined.",

Specifically, it suggests that `sign(z)` should be rewritten as `z / Abs(z)` for all complex non-zero `z`. Additionally, the behavior when `z` is zero is discussed, suggesting that `sign(0)` might be better as `nan` rather than `0` to align with `0 / Abs(0)` resulting in `nan`. The given search results contain relevant code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, including the `sign` class definition and its `eval` method. These code spans are pertinent as they define the behavior and evaluation of the `sign` function, which directly relates to the request to rewrite the function using `Abs`. The `eval` method is particularly important as it contains logic for handling different cases of the argument, including zero, which is a critical aspect of the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans provide a foundation for understanding and potentially modifying the `sign` function to better align with the desired functionality involving `Abs`.",
