The current behavior for `sign(0)` is different from `0 / Abs(0)`. Analyzing the provided search results, we find definitions of `sign` and `Abs` functions in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py', and a potential helper function `refine_sign` in 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py'. Both class `sign` and `Abs` show the handling of their respective value ranges including zero, extended positive/negative, and even imaginary numbers. To address the issue, we would likely need to modify the `eval` method of `sign` for handling the special case of zero and perhaps adjust the evaluation of other conditions. Using `Abs._eval_rewrite_as_Abs` or similar could help in rewriting `sign`. The results include relevant code spans such as import statements, the main class definitions, their specialized evaluation methods, and singularity handling. Considering that the rewrite mentioned might require a careful adjustment at the specific handling (like in the `eval` or `_eval_rewrite` methods), the search uncovered relevant segments and files for this task.",

The new search results confirm that `sign(z)` is defined as `z / Abs(z)` in the `doit` method of the `sign` function. The `Abs` function is also present in the search results. The issue is relevant to the `sign` and `Abs` functions, and there's also a discussion on how to handle the case when `sign(0)` might need to be `nan` or `0`. The search results include spans about `sign.doit`, `sign.eval`, and various evaluations of the `Abs` function, all of which are relevant to the issue. Therefore, it seems the search has found the relevant code spans. Most notably, the span 'sign.doit' directly addresses the use of `Abs` in the `sign` function.

The current implementation of `sign` and `Abs` functions are examined along with their methods such as `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_derivative`, etc. The search results show detailed implementations of these functions, including how they handle different types of inputs, their derivatives, and their behavior for various inputs, which are crucial for understanding how to implement the rewrite. The `sign` function's `doit` and `eval` methods should be specifically addressed to ensure they handle the zero case properly as suggested by the issue. Additionally, the Abs function's `eval`, `fdiff`, and `_eval_derivative` methods show how the absolute value is computed, which is essential for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`. From the context provided, these methods appear to be relevant to addressing the issue. These found code spans, particularly in `sign.doit` and `sign.eval`, and their logic within `Abs.eval`, `Abs.fdiff`, and `Abs._eval_derivative`, are likely the most relevant sections that need to be focused on to address the issue. The task is not yet complete as the rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs` should be implemented correctly to handle all cases, including when the argument is zero.",
