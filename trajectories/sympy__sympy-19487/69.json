The main challenge is to handle the case when 'z' is zero, as 'sign(0)' currently returns '0' while '0 / Abs(0)' results in 'nan'. Relevant files and classes include the `sign` and `Abs` classes within the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file, as well as the `FCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/fcode.py` and various functions like `refine_abs` and `refine_sign` in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`. Therefore, the search should focus on these files and specific functions or classes related to `sign` and `Abs`.",

Understanding how the `sign` function behaves for zero and how `Abs` handles zero is crucial. If `sign(0)` should be `nan`, modifications might be needed in the `eval` method of the `sign` class.
