Evaluative functions for handling zero and non-zero cases in `sign`, relevant since the rewrite needs to account for the possibility of the argument being zero. 3. Other files such as `sympy/core/evalf.py` and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` contain functions that interact with or consider properties of functions like `sign` and `Abs`. To ensure completeness, it's crucial to consider not just isolated code spans but entire methods or sections that handle the rewriting of `sign`, conditions for zero and non-zero arguments, and how `Abs` might be integrated into these without causing issues for zero values. This involves a detailed understanding of how each code span interacts with others to handle input and output scenarios as described in the reported issue.

Specifically, the user wants to see the sign function rewritten as `x / Abs(x)` for all complex non-zero `x`, and there is a concern about how the rewrite should handle the case when `x` is zero. The current behavior is that `sign(0)` returns 0, but `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan`. The user suggests that perhaps `sign(0)` should also be `nan`, or the rewrite should carefully handle the possibility of the argument being zero. The search results and existing context show how the `sign` function is currently implemented and how it interacts with the `Abs` function, including the definition of `sign(z) = z / Abs(z)` for non-zero complex `z`. The `evalf` module contains code related to the numerical evaluation of expressions, including `Abs`, but this code seems tangential to the rewrite concern. The `refine` module contains functions for refining symbolic expressions under given assumptions, including a specific function for refining `sign` based on these assumptions. While this helps in understanding how `sign` behaves with assumptions, it does not directly address the rewrite in terms of `Abs`. Therefore, the most relevant code spans are indeed in the `functions/elementary/complexes.py` file, focusing on the `sign` class methods, especially `eval`, `doit`, and the `Abs` class methods that interact with `sign`.
