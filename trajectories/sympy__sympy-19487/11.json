The primary goal is to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of the `Abs` function in the SymPy library, considering how the function should behave when the argument is zero. Through the provided search results, I identified key parts of the codebase, specifically the definitions and evaluations of the `sign` and `Abs` functions. Given these elements, I selected the code spans that directly relate to the implementation and behavior of these functions, including the `sign` class and its `eval` method, and the `Abs` class and its `eval` method. These selections are crucial for understanding how the `sign` function currently handles different cases, including zero, and how it could potentially be rewritten using the `Abs` function. This analysis lays the groundwork for further development to align with the issue's requirements.",

This covers the main functionality of `sign`. Additionally, the `Abs` class is also present, which is essential for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`. The `Abs` class includes methods such as `eval` and `fdiff`, which are relevant for understanding how `Abs` works. The `_eval_derivative` method in `Abs` also shows the derivative of `Abs` in terms of `sign`, providing further context on their interaction.
