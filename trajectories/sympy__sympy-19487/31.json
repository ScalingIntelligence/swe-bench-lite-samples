In the provided search results, the `_print_sign` method in `FCodePrinter` class appears to be relevant as it deals with the `sign` function. This method handles different cases such as integer, complex, and infinite arguments, and tries to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`. It also appears to handle the case where the argument is zero by using `merge` function to return either `0`, `arg/Abs(arg)`, or a special case for when `Abs(arg)` is `0`. This seems relevant to the reported issue as it aligns with the idea of rewritting `sign` in terms of `Abs` and handling the case of `arg` being zero.

I need to identify the parts of the code that are directly related to the `sign` function and its current handling of `Abs`. The main sections to look for are the `sign.doit` method, which currently expresses `sign` in terms of `Abs` for non-zero arguments, and any other evaluation methods or properties of `sign` that deal with zero values or are relevant for rewriting in terms of `Abs`. Additionally, I should check if there are any other places where `sign` is rewritten or transformed, such as in the `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` or `_eval_rewrite_as_Heaviside` methods. The search results show these methods and the `sign.doit` method, which are critical for understanding how `sign` is currently implemented and how it might be updated to handle zero values more consistently.",

Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
