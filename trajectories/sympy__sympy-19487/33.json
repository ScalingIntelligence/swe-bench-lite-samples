From the provided context, the `sign` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` and the `Abs` function is also defined in the same file. Other relevant files might include those where the `sign` function is used or rewritten, such as `sympy/printing/fcode.py`, `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, and `sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py`. Additionally, `sympy/core/evalf.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` might also be relevant due to their handling of evaluations and rewrites, respectively.

The `sign.doit` method directly computes the `sign` function as the argument divided by its absolute value, which matches the desired behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the `Abs` class and its related methods (`Abs.fdiff` and `Abs._eval_rewrite_as_sign`) are relevant as they show how the `Abs` function interacts with and can be rewritten in terms of the `sign` function. This directly addresses the request to rewrite `sign` in terms of `Abs`. The handling of zero in `sign.eval` and the refinement of `sign` in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` also provide context on how special cases like `sign(0)` are currently handled and might need adjustment according to the issue's suggestion. These findings are sufficient to proceed with the implementation of the requested feature, including the handling of `sign(0)`. The identified code spans provide a clear understanding of the current implementation and potential areas for modification or extension.",

The `sign` function is already defined to return `z / Abs(z)` for non-zero `z`, which directly addresses the requirement to rewrite `sign` in terms of `Abs`. The issue also discusses the treatment of `sign(0)`, and the provided context shows that `sign(0)` returns `0`. The `Abs` function correctly handles various edge cases, which is also relevant to ensuring the robustness of the `sign` function. Additionally, the file `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` contains logic for refining the `sign` function based on assumptions, which could be relevant to ensuring the rewrite behaves correctly under different conditions.

However, the primary focus should be on adjusting the `sign` function's behavior when the argument is zero to align with the desired functionality as described in the issue.

The current implementation of `sign` should be examined to determine how it handles zero and if it aligns with the desired behavior of returning `nan` for zero input when rewritten in terms of `Abs`. Reviewing the relevant code spans helps in understanding the existing functionality and potential areas for improvement.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, the following points can be identified:\n1. The `sign` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` and contains methods like `doit` and `eval` that handle specific cases.\n2. The behavior of zero is currently handled in the `eval` method of the `sign` function, where `sign(0)` returns `S.Zero`.\n3. The `Abs` function is also defined in the same file and includes methods like `fdiff` and `eval` which could be relevant when considering the rewrite.\n4. The `sign` function's `doit` method already uses `Abs` to handle non-zero complex numbers.\n5. The `FCodePrinter` class from `sympy/printing/fcode.py` includes a method `_print_sign` which might be used for converting SymPy expressions into Fortran code but is not directly related to the rewrite operation.\n6. The `MinMaxBase` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` has some elements that involve `Abs`, but they relate to rewrites involving `Min` and `Max` functions and are not directly linked to the `sign` function.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant files and spans of code pertaining to the `sign` function's rewrite in terms of `Abs` primarily exist within `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`.",
