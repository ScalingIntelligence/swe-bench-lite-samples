The primary concern is handling the case where the argument is zero, as currently, `sign(0)` returns 0, but 0 / Abs(0) results in nan. The first step is to identify the `sign` function in the provided context and understand how it is currently implemented and used. Following that, focus on the `Abs` function to see how it relates to the `sign` function. Given the provided file context, most relevant files seem to be already known, so the next step is to formulate specific search requests to look into the details of these files, especially focusing on the implementation of `sign` and `Abs`.",

The issue focuses on modifying the `sign` function and handling the case when the argument is zero. The relevant code spans include the definition of the `sign` class, its `doit` method, and the `eval` method. These methods currently handle the computation of the `sign` function and need to be modified to handle rewriting in terms of `Abs` and managing the zero case as per the issue requirement. Additionally, the `Abs` class is also relevant as it is the function intended to be used in the rewritten `sign` function. Therefore, the identified spans include the `sign` class definition, its `doit` and `eval` methods, and the `Abs` class definition.",
