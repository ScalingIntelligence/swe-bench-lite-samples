The key elements to look for are the definitions and behaviors of both `sign` and `Abs` functions within the sympy library. In the provided search results, we find the definition of the `sign` function and its methods like `doit`, `eval`, and various evaluation methods. We also find the definition of the `Abs` function and its methods including `_eval_rewrite_as_sign`. The `doit` method of `sign` currently handles the case where `z` is non-zero by returning `z / Abs(z)`, which aligns with the requested rewrite. The `eval` method of `sign` handles the cases for `zero`, `positive`, and `negative` values. Additionally, the `_print_sign` method in `FCodePrinter` class addresses handling `sign` for integer, complex, and infinite arguments. Overall, the existing code provides a good foundation to meet the requirement of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs` except for handling edge cases like `sign(0)`, which currently returns `0` but could be rewritten to `nan`. This needs to be addressed in the refinement.",
