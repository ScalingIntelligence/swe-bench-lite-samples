The main focus should be on the `sign` and `Abs` classes in the `functions/elementary/complexes.py` file. Additionally, considering the handling of the `sign(0)` case, which currently returns `0`, but dividing by `Abs(0)` results in `nan`, suggests that special handling might be needed. Therefore, the search should first focus on the `sign` class to find its definition and any associated methods, particularly those related to rewriting functions and evaluation. Then, check if there's any method in the `Abs` class that concerns rewriting or transformation of expressions. The `refine_sign` function in `assumptions/refine.py` might also be relevant, as it could contain logic for refining `sign` expressions.",
