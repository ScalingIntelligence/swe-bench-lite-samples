            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue seeks to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of `Abs` for all complex non-zero `z`. The current implementation of `sign` in sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py shows the `sign` function, its methods, and also includes the `Abs` class with its methods. The current implementation of `sign` already returns `z / Abs(z)` for non-zero `z` in the `doit` method. However, the handling of `sign(0)` is not addressed specifically, and the feedback suggests it might be better to return `nan`. In sympy/assumptions/refine.py, there's an additional refinement function for `sign` that considers the assumptions about the argument to return `S.Zero` if the argument is zero, which seems relevant for handling the case where `x` is zero. Additionally, sympy/printing/fcode.py contains a printer method for `sign` that deals with how to print the `sign` function in a specific format, potentially useful for implementing new functionality in a way that maintains consistency across different representations. From the search results, the relevant spans appear to be those that define the `sign` function, its methods, and the methods of the `Abs` class, as they directly address the implementation and rewriting of `sign` in terms of `Abs`. Moreover, the refinement and printer methods are relevant as they handle additional aspects related to the `sign` function, such as assumptions about its argument and representation across different formats, which are important for fully addressing the issue. Therefore, the identified spans include the definitions and methods of the `sign` and `Abs` classes, the refinement function for `sign`, and the printer method for `sign`.",

The current implementation of the `sign` function needs to be re-evaluated to handle the case where the argument is zero properly.

This involves analyzing the current implementation and the relevant sections of the codebase, especially those dealing with the `sign` and `Abs` functions. The search results provided contain relevant code spans for the `sign` and `Abs` functions, including their implementations and methods for evaluation and rewriting. The `sign.doit` and `sign.eval` methods are particularly pertinent, as they handle the computation and evaluation of the `sign` function. Similarly, the `Abs` function's methods such as `fdiff` and `eval` are also relevant as they interact closely with the `sign` function and are key to understanding how `Abs` might be used to redefine `sign`.",
