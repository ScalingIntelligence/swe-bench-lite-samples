The provided context shows that the `sign` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, and there are other related functions like `Abs` and `arg` in the same file. Additionally, `sign` is used in `sympy/printing/fcode.py` and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`. Given the nature of the issue, the most relevant place to start would be `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, where both `sign` and `Abs` are defined. Focusing on these classes and their methods should help in implementing the desired rewrite.",

Additionally, the `Abs` class definition and its methods are directly relevant to rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`. These methods include `fdiff`, `eval`, and `_eval_derivative`, among others. Notably, the `sign.doit` method already contains logic that could be adapted for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`, as it includes the computation `self.args[0] / Abs(self.args[0])` for non-zero arguments.
