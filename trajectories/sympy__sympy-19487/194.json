            "scratch_pad": "Analysis of the reported issue reveals two main tasks: (1) rewriting the sign function in terms of Abs and (2) handling the case where the argument of sign is zero. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans, primarily in sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py, which define the sign and Abs functions. Specifically, the 'sign.eval' span provides the current evaluation logic for the sign function, which needs to be adjusted to handle the zero case correctly. The 'Abs' and 'Abs.eval' spans provide the definition and evaluation logic for the Abs function, which is crucial for rewriting sign in terms of Abs. Extrapolating from the current evaluation in 'sign.eval', it becomes clear that handling the zero case and ensuring that the rewrite method functions correctly when the argument is zero are crucial. The issue suggests that sign(0) should ideally be nan, which is not currently handled. While handling the rewrite and ensuring it does not fail when the argument is zero, implementing these changes would require careful handling of these scenarios. Looking deeper into the provided results, it becomes evident that no immediate solution is present to handle this edge case directly, except for our nuanced approach. Since the rewrite function or method for sign in terms of Abs is not yet defined, what is found might be considered a partial solution suitable for implementation, a new function to handle the rewrite of sign in terms of Abs. Consequently, we will utilize the spans identified as relevant and suggest that the final solution would need additions or alterations to be able to confidently declare this process complete.",
