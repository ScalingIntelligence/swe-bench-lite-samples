Given the context provided, it is likely that the relevant code snippets can be found within the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file or related files that define or manipulate the `sign` and `Abs` functions.

The `sign` function is specifically defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, so it's a good starting point.

The most pertinent spans are those relating to the `sign` class and its methods such as `doit` and `eval`, as well as the `Abs` class and its methods.

Additionally, the `sign.doit` method directly addresses the division of the argument by `Abs` of the argument for non-zero cases, which is the core requirement of the issue.

However, the handling of `sign(0)` is not explicitly addressed, which is a crucial part of the issue. This missing part is important for completing the task. Moreover, the `Abs` function is also defined and includes methods like `_eval_rewrite_as_sign` that directly relate to the issue.

The `sign` function is defined to return different values based on the properties of its argument (e.g., zero, positive, negative). For zero arguments, it specifically returns `S.Zero`. The `Abs` function calculates the absolute value of its argument, and its behavior with zero is straightforward as it returns `S.Zero`. The issue of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs` and handling the case of zero seems to be directly addressed in the `doit` method of the `sign` class, where it handles nonzero complex numbers by dividing the argument by its absolute value. However, there is no specific handling for `sign(0)` when trying to rewrite in terms of `Abs`. This may indicate that additional logic might be needed to handle `sign(0)` in the rewrite process, possibly returning `S.NaN` as suggested by the issue.",

We also need to address the special case where `x` is zero, as `sign(0)` currently returns `0` but `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan`. This suggests that `sign(0)` should possibly be changed to return `nan` as well. We should look for code spans that define the `sign` function and its evaluation methods, as well as spans that involve `Abs` and how it is evaluated or re-written. We also need to ensure that the handling of zero in both functions is consistent.

Specifically, it suggests that sign(z) should be rewritten as z / Abs(z) for all complex non-zero z. The issue also discusses handling the case where z is zero, suggesting that sign(0) should be nan, rather than 0, because 0 / Abs(0) results in nan. Existing code includes the definition of the `sign` function, which handles non-zero cases with z / Abs(z), and the `Abs` function, which has methods for differentiation and evaluation. The search results include additional methods like `_eval_conjugate`, `_eval_is_nonnegative`, `_eval_is_imaginary`, `_eval_power`, `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise`, and `_eval_simplify` for the `sign` function, and `fdiff`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_derivative`, and `eval` for the `Abs` function.

The `sign` function's `doit` method indicates a straightforward handling of non-zero arguments by dividing them by their absolute value, which aligns with the mathematical definition for non-zero quantities. The `eval` method of the `sign` class also checks for zero and directly returns `S.Zero`. However, there seems to be no specific handling for `sign(0)` when rewriting it in terms of `Abs`, which could lead to issues as noted in the problem statement (division by zero). Exploring the `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method within the `sign` class, if it exists, or modifications to the `doit` method to handle zero might yield solutions. Additionally, the broader codebase interactions involving `sign` and `Abs` need examination, possibly looking at files like `sympy/printing/fcode.py` and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` for related functionalities.",
