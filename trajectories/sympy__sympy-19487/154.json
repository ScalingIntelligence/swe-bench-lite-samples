Specifically, the `sign` function should be rewritten such that `sign(x).rewrite(Abs)` returns `x/Abs(x)`, and handling the special case where `x` is zero is also discussed. The search results include significant parts of the `sign` and `Abs` functions from the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file, which are directly relevant to the issue. The `sign` class definition and its `eval` method are found, which handle the evaluation of the `sign` function for different cases, including zero and complex numbers. Additionally, the `Abs` class and its methods, such as `fdiff` and `_eval_derivative`, are present, which show how the `Abs` function is related to the `sign` function in terms of differentiation. This context is crucial for understanding how to implement the rewrite. Therefore, I will extract the relevant code spans from the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file that pertain to the `sign` and `Abs` functions.",
