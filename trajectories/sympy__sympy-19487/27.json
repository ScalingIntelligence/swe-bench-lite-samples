I also considered the potential need to handle zero cases and how the current implementation might need adjustments. From the search results, it appears that `sign(x).rewrite(Abs)` is not directly implemented, but the building blocks like the `sign.doit` method and the `Abs.fdiff` method provide parts of the solution. The `sign.eval` method already has handling for zero cases but needs to be reviewed for the rewrite functionality.",
