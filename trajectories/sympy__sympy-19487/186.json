The reported issue specifically mentions the `sign` function and the `Abs` function, and it seeks to understand how `sign` can be rewritten using `Abs`, particularly handling the case when the argument is zero. The provided search results include several code spans from different files that define or use these functions. The most relevant sections are those defining the `sign` and `Abs` classes and their methods, such as `eval`, `fdiff`, and `_eval_derivative`. These sections provide the core logic for evaluating and differentiating these functions. Additionally, the `rewrite` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` is relevant as it describes the mechanism for rewriting expressions in terms of other functions, which could be used to implement the requested rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs`. However, the current implementation of `sign` does not explicitly handle the zero case differently in terms of `Abs`, which needs further attention. The code related to `sign` and `Abs` in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` should be examined to ensure proper handling of zero in the rewrite process. Additional attention should be paid to how singularities are managed in these functions, as indicated by the `_singularities` attribute. Overall, the identified code spans provide a good basis for implementing the required rewrite functionality, but careful attention to edge cases, particularly around zero handling, will be essential.",

From the provided code base, the most relevant location is the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file, specifically the `sign` class, its `eval` method, and the `Abs` class. Additionally, the `rewrite` method in the `Basic` class is also pertinent, as it provides the mechanism for rewriting expressions in SymPy. The search results confirm the presence of these components and their related code spans. The code spans identified in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` cover the `sign` function definition and its evaluation logic, as well as the `Abs` function definition, which is essential for the requested rewrite. The `sign` function's behavior around zero needs special attention due to division by zero concerns, which is reflected in the `eval` method's handling of zero cases. The `Abs` function's evaluation and derivative methods also show interactions with `sign`, indicating potential areas for modification to integrate a rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs`. The `rewrite` method from the `Basic` class provides a structural approach to expression rewriting, which could be leveraged for the requested functionality. Overall, the identified code spans are highly relevant to the task of rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`.",
