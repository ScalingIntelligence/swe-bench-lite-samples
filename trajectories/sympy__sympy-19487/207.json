Directly relevant code spans include the `sign` function definition and its associated methods, particularly those that deal with evaluation and rewriting. Additionally, the `Abs` function definition and its methods for evaluation and rewriting are relevant, especially `Abs._eval_rewrite_as_sign`, which suggests a way to rewrite `Abs` in terms of `sign`. The current definition of `sign` does not include a specific method for rewriting in terms of `Abs`, which is the main gap identified by the issue. However, the `sign._eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` method offers a way to express `sign` in a different form which could be useful for further transformations. The handling of zero in `sign` and `Abs` should also be considered, as there seems to be a mismatch between `sign(0)` returning 0 and `0 / Abs(0)` returning `nan`. The `Abs.eval` method demonstrates how zero is currently handled and could be adjusted if `sign(0)` should return `nan` as well. Therefore, the relevant code spans include sections where `sign` and `Abs` are defined and their methods for evaluation and rewriting, focusing on how to integrate the `Abs` function into the definition of `sign` for non-zero complex numbers and how to handle zero appropriately.",
