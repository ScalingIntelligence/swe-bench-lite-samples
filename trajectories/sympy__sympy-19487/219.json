The search results provided include code from `sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py`, which contains imports and a method `_eval_rewrite_as_sign` within the `Heaviside` class. This method directly deals with rewriting the `sign` function, making it highly relevant to the issue. The method `_eval_rewrite_as_sign` uses `sign` and involves a transformation involving `sign(arg) + 1` divided by 2, conditional on whether `arg` is not equal to 0 or if `Heaviside(0)` is specifically treated as 1/2. This aligns with the need to handle the zero case carefully, as mentioned in the issue. Therefore, this span is identified as relevant.",

The initial file context provided in `sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py` contains a method `Heaviside._eval_rewrite_as_sign` which utilizes the `sign` function, suggesting that this file is relevant to the issue. The search results reveal multiple files with code spans that are potentially relevant. Notably, `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` contains the definition of the `sign` function itself. Additionally, files in the `sympy/printing` directory, like `pycode.py`, `lambdarepr.py`, `rcode.py`, `latex.py`, and others, contain methods for printing `Piecewise` functions, which might be relevant if the `sign` function is being rewritten as a `Piecewise` function. Similarly, `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains the definition of the `Piecewise` class and its methods, which are crucial for handling conditional expressions in SymPy. Based on this analysis, the relevant files and spans are those handling the `sign` function, `Abs` function, and conditional expressions (`Piecewise`). These will help in understanding how the `sign` function is currently implemented and how it can be rewritten in terms of `Abs`. Therefore, the search task is deemed complete based on the identified relevant code spans. However, further analysis in the `sign` function itself to handle the zero case specifically would be necessary.",

The issue specifies that `sign(z)` should be rewritten as `z / Abs(z)` for all complex non-zero `z`, and discusses handling the case where `z` is zero. The current implementation of `sign` includes methods like `doit`, `eval`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise`. The search results provide additional methods within the `sign` class, such as `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` and `_eval_simplify`, which could be relevant for implementing the rewrite in terms of `Abs`. Furthermore, the `Abs` class and its methods in the same file are also crucial for this task, as `Abs` will be used in the rewritten definition of `sign`.",

Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
