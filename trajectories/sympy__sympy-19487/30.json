The 'sign' function is currently defined as `sign(z) := z / Abs(z)` for complex non-zero `z`, and the task involves ensuring this rewriting is correctly implemented and handles the case where `z` is zero. Relevant files and methods include 'sign' and 'Abs' classes in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py', as well as the 'sign' method in 'sympy/printing/fcode.py'. Additionally, it would be beneficial to check the 'refine_sign' function in 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py' and the '_eval_rewrite_as_sign' method in 'sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py'. Therefore, the search should focus on these specific locations and methods to ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue.",

While the 'doit' method for the 'sign' class handles non-zero cases by rewriting 'sign' in terms of 'Abs', it does not explicitly address the case when `z` is zero. The issue suggests that 'sign(0)' should be 'nan', which is not currently handled. The file context also includes methods like '_eval_conjugate' and '_eval_simplify' which might be relevant for a fuller understanding of the class behavior but do not directly implement the rewrite in terms of 'Abs'. The analysis within the 'sign' class eval method also does not handle the zero case explicitly for rewriting in terms of 'Abs'. Therefore, while the file context is relevant, it does not cover the specific handling of the zero case as per the issue.",
