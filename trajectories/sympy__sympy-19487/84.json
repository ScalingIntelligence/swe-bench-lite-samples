The main concern is handling the case where the argument might be zero, which results in a division by zero. Relevant files have already been provided, and it's clear that the `sign` and `Abs` functions are defined in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py'. The `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method for the `sign` class needs to be implemented or adjusted to handle this rewrite properly, especially considering the possibility of the argument being zero.",

The current implementation of `sign` in the provided context already includes logic to handle non-zero arguments by returning `arg / Abs(arg)`. The primary concern is the handling of zero, where the current implementation returns `0`, but there is a suggestion to return `nan` to be consistent with the mathematical operation `0 / Abs(0)` resulting in `nan`. Given this, the relevant code spans to concentrate on are those defining the behavior of `sign` with respect to its evaluation, specifically when the argument is zero. Also, the interaction with `Abs` needs to be checked to ensure that the rewrite operation is correctly implemented.\n\nThe search results align well with this focus. The code spans identified include the `sign` class and its `eval` method, where the logic for handling zero is explicitly defined. Additionally, the `Abs` class and its `eval` method are present in the context, which is crucial for understanding how `Abs` behaves with zero.
