This involves understanding how `sign` and `Abs` are currently implemented and potentially modifying the `rewrite` method of the `sign` function. The relevant files identified so far include those defining the `sign`, `Abs`, and `Heaviside` functions, as well as their associated methods. The primary focus should be on `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` where both `sign` and `Abs` are defined. Additionally, `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` and `sympy/printing/fcode.py` could also be relevant as they handle specific aspects of these functions.",

The main focus is on the `sign` and `Abs` classes in the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file. Specifically, we need to review the `sign.doit` and `sign.eval` methods to understand how the `sign` function behaves for different types of input. Additionally, we should look at the `Abs.__eval__` method to understand how `Abs` handles various inputs. These methods will provide insight into how `sign` can be rewritten using `Abs`, considering edge cases such as handling zero input. The review of `sign.doit` and `sign.eval` methods indicates that they already partially handle the rewrite in terms of `Abs`, but explicit rewrite support is missing. This indicates that the relevant code spans involve the `sign` class definition and the `Abs` class interaction.",
