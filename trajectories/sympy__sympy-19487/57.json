However, there is no explicit method shown to rewrite `sign` as `Abs` within the context of expression rewrites or simplifications. This suggests that while the core functionalities are defined, the specific rewrite capability (as requested in the issue) may need to be implemented or adjusted in the relevant functionality for expression rewrites.

However, there isn't a direct method for rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`. The existing `sign` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` handles various cases such as zero, positive, negative, and imaginary values, but lacks a specific method to convert it into `Abs`. Given the structure of the code and the need to handle the special case when the argument is zero (where `sign(0)` should return `nan` instead of `0`), it is clear that a new method needs to be developed within the `sign` class to implement this functionality.
