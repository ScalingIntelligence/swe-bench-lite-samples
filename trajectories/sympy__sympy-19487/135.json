The relevant files are likely those containing definitions for the `sign` and `Abs` functions, including their method definitions and evaluation strategies. Given the context provided, the search should focus on these specific functions and their implementations within the sympy module. Noting that test files are not in the search scope, only core source files should be considered relevant. The search function can specify searching for the `sign` class's rewrite method to handle the `Abs` case, and potentially lookout for how the code snippet given as an example is dealt with in the `Abs` class methods. Emphasizing the need for handling the special case of `z == 0` separately might be vital to address all aspects of the issue at hand.",

These methods provide the current behavior of the `sign` function and would be essential for implementing the requested rewrite. Additionally, the definitions of the `Abs` function and its methods are also provided, which are directly involved in the requested rewrite. It's noted that currently, the `sign` function returns 0 for zero inputs, whereas dividing 0 by `Abs(0)` results in NaN, suggesting a potential inconsistency.
