The spans 'sign.doit', 'sign.eval', and 'sign._eval_Abs' seem particularly relevant as they directly involve the computation and evaluation of the `sign` function. There is also a need to address the case where `x` might be zero, which is currently handled differently in the `sign.eval` span. Additionally, 'sign._eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise' and 'sign._eval_rewrite_as_Heaviside' might be useful for understanding how the function can be rewritten in different contexts.

However, the issue suggests that `sign(0)` might be better handled as `nan`. The current implementation does not directly rewrite `sign` in terms of `Abs`, but the `doit` method provides a starting point for such a rewrite.
