The `sign` function logic covers handling different cases such as zero, positive, and negative values, as well as imaginary numbers. The `Abs` function, on the other hand, calculates the absolute value and has methods for differentiation and series evaluation. The absence of a `.rewrite(Abs)` method suggests that the necessary logic for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs` is not currently implemented in the `complexes.py` file.

The current implementation of `sign` and `Abs` functions was already analyzed.\n\nIn the new search results, we find the definition of the `sign` class and its method `doit`, which performs the calculation `self.args[0] / Abs(self.args[0])` for non-zero values. This directly addresses the requirement to rewrite `sign` in terms of `Abs`. Additionally, there are evaluations related to `Abs` that show how it handles various inputs, confirming that `Abs` is used appropriately within the codebase.\n\nGiven this information, we can identify relevant code spans that address the issue of rewriting `sign` with `Abs`.",

For handling the case when `z` is zero, the existing code returns `0`, but it does not explicitly handle the case where zero division might occur with `Abs(0)`. This indicates a need for further implementation or modification to address the requirement accurately.

The current context already provides a detailed look into the 'sign' function's implementation, including its 'doit' and 'eval' methods. We also need to consider any handling of 'Abs' within the 'sign' function or other related functions to understand how to extend or modify 'sign' using 'Abs'. From the context, we see that the 'sign' function is defined such that 'sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)' for complex non-zero 'z'. This suggests that modifications will likely involve adjusting the 'sign' function to handle cases where the argument is zero and to ensure that the 'rewrite' method for 'sign' can express it in terms of 'Abs'. The provided 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py' files also contain relevant patterns for 'rewrite' functionality that could potentially be adapted or extended to implement the desired behavior.",
