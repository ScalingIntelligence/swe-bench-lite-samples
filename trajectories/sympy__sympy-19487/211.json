The issue also discusses the behavior when the argument is zero, which suggests looking into how these functions handle edge cases like zero. Given the context provided, it seems relevant to focus on the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file where both `sign` and `Abs` are defined. Additionally, we should investigate the `heurisch.py` file, which mentions a `sign` function, possibly related to integration heuristics. Finally, the `sympy/printing/fcode.py` file, which includes an FCodePrinter method for printing the `sign` function in Fortran code, could also be relevant for understanding how the `sign` function is handled across different contexts.",

The search results contain relevant sections of code from 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' that define the 'sign' and 'Abs' functions. The 'sign.eval' and 'Abs.eval' methods are particularly relevant, as they handle the evaluation of these functions.

Additionally, the issue specifically mentions that rewriting 'sign' in terms of 'Abs' should be careful about handling the zero argument. The 'sympy/integrals/heurisch.py' file also contains references to the 'sign' function, which might be relevant for understanding where the 'sign' function is used and potentially how 'Abs' could replace 'sign' in those contexts.

Given the context of the `sign` and `Abs` functions from `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, it's clear that the `sign` function is sophisticated in handling various forms of input, including complex numbers, while the `Abs` function deals with magnitude calculations very precisely, including special handling for imaginary numbers and even exponents. Since the problem of handling zero specifically is mentioned, we should investigate further into how the library typically manages such cases in other functions or across other modules. The `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` file, as suggested, might contain common rewrite strategies or helper functions that could inform a solution. Beyond this, we should consider any conventions or patterns used in other files like `sympy/integrals/heurisch.py` and `sympy/printing/fcode.py` for handling similar issues.",

The search results also include an interesting method in `miscellaneous.py` that rewrites `MinMaxBase` in terms of `Abs`, which might be indirectly relevant to handling `sign` in a similar manner. Additionally, there's a `_print_sign` method in `fcode.py` which is a printer method and not directly related to the functionality, but shows that `sign` is used elsewhere in the codebase. To address the issue, we need to focus on the implementations of `sign` and `Abs` in `complexes.py` and potentially consider how `MinMaxBase._eval_rewrite_as_Abs` might influence a similar rewrite for `sign`.",
