I start by examining the search results from `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` because it is likely to contain the implementations of these functions. I look for the `sign` class and its methods, particularly those involved in its evaluation and rewriting rules. In the provided search results, I find the `sign` class and several of its methods including `doit`, `eval`, and methods for rewriting. I also find the `Abs` class and its methods related to rewriting. Finally, I see some influence in the fcode printing and assumptions refinement file, though those might not be part of the core rewrite functionality. Based on the reported issue, the core of the functionality revolves around the handling of zero and non-zero conditions in the `sign` and `Abs` functions, which can be directly addressed in the identified spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`. This includes evaluating how `sign` rewrites to `Abs` and how zero cases should be managed in a rewrite context.",
