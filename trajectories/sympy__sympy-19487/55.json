The reported issue outlines the need to handle cases where the argument to sign might be zero, which currently leads to a division by zero error in the rewrite process. From the search results, two primary code spans seem relevant. The first is in 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py', where the 'refine_sign' function handles cases such as when the argument is zero or real or imaginary, returning specific values like zero or unit imaginary numbers. This function seems crucial as it directly deals with how the sign function behaves under different assumptions about its argument. The second relevant code span is in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' under 'signsimp', which simplifies expressions involving the sign function. Although it doesn't directly address the rewrite to Abs, it's useful for context on how the sign function is generally dealt with in SymPy's simplification processes. However, based on the task, only the 'refine_sign' span directly relates to the rewrite effort described in the issue. It may provide insights or a basis for handling zero cases when rewriting sign as Abs, which is critical given the issue's concerns.",

This suggests that the handling of `sign(0)` is set to return `S.Zero` based on the assumption that the argument is zero. This handling might need to be adjusted if `sign(0)` is expected to return `nan` as per the issue description. Additionally, since the `refine_sign` function uses assumptions to refine the `sign` function, it may influence how the `sign` function can be rewritten in terms of `Abs`. Therefore, further investigation into the `sign` class definition and methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, and the `signsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is necessary to understand how to implement the desired rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs`.",

  "initial_message": "Rewrite sign as abs\nIn sympy the `sign` function is defined as\r\n```\r\n    sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)\r\n```\r\nfor all complex non-zero `z`. There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                   \r\n x \r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\u2502x\u2502\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(0)                                                                                                                               \r\n0\r\n>>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                            \r\nnan\r\n```\r\nMaybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
