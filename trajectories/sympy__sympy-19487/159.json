The `sign` function is currently defined as `z / Abs(z)` for non-zero complex numbers `z`. The challenge is to handle the case when `z` is zero, as the current definition results in `nan`. To address this, we need to identify where the `sign` function is defined and how it can be rewritten in terms of `Abs`, including handling the zero case. Relevant files to check include those where `sign` and `Abs` functions are defined, such as `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` and other related modules. Additionally, the `Heaviside` function might also be relevant as it can be rewritten in terms of `sign`.",

Additionally, the definition of the `Abs` function and its evaluation method are also present. These spans will be useful for implementing the desired functionality of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`. Specifically, the `sign.eval` span contains the current implementation of the `sign` function, which can be modified to use `Abs` instead. The `Abs.eval` span provides context on how `Abs` is currently implemented and used. Furthermore, the `sign._eval_conjugate` and `Abs._eval_derivative` spans may also be relevant for ensuring the rewrite does not disrupt other functionalities.
