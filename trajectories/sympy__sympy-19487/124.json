The key part of the issue is understanding how `sign(z)` can be expressed as `z / Abs(z)` for complex non-zero `z`. The specific concern raised is about handling the case where `z` is zero. \n\nFrom the search results, we need to identify code spans that define or interact with the `sign` and `Abs` functions. The `sign` class is defined with a `doit` method and an `eval` method, and the `Abs` class is defined with an `eval` method and several rewrite methods. The `sign.doit` method already contains the key rewrite mentioned in the issue, converting `sign(z)` to `z / Abs(z)` for non-zero `z`. The `sign.eval` method handles special cases such as zero, positive and negative values, but does not specifically address the rewriting in terms of `Abs`. \n\nIt seems that the key part of the issue, rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`, is already implemented in the `sign.doit` method. However, the issue of handling zero should be considered, and it seems that the current implementation for zero cases may not be fully aligned with the desired behavior as discussed in the issue. This should be a focus for further investigation and potential modification. \n\nOverall, the most relevant code spans from the search results are related to the definition and methods of the `sign` and `Abs` functions, which are directly related to the issue's demands.",
