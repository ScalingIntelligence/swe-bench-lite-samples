From the provided context, it seems that the `sign` function is defined in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' and there are related functions like `Abs` and `Heaviside` in the same module. A detailed search in this module might reveal the necessary code snippets or logic related to the `sign` function's rewrite in terms of `Abs`. Additionally, it might be beneficial to look into 'sympy/printing/fcode.py' and 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py' as they contain specific methods for `sign`.

The current implementation of `sign` in sympy includes handling for various conditions such as being zero, extended positive, extended negative, and imaginary. However, it lacks a direct rewrite in terms of `Abs`. The analysis of the code spans in sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py indicates that the method `doit` of the `sign` function calculates the sign for non-zero arguments by dividing the argument by its absolute value, which is a step towards the desired functionality. However, this method does not handle the case when the argument is zero, where the expected output seems to be `nan`. The `rewrite` method in sympy/series/gruntz.py shows how to rewrite expressions, but it is not directly related to the `sign` function's requirement to rewrite it as `Abs`. The search results do not provide a direct implementation of rewriting `sign` as `Abs` nor explicit handling of the zero case for such a rewrite.",
