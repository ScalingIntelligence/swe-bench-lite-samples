The issue also raises questions about how to handle zero values with the `sign` function. I analyzed the provided search results, focusing on the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file, as it contains the definition and various methods associated with the `sign` function. I identified several relevant spans within this file: the `sign` class definition, the `eval` method that handles different cases for the input, the `doit` method that computes the sign for non-zero arguments, and the `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` and `_eval_rewrite_as_Heaviside` methods that deal with rewriting `sign` in terms of other functions. These spans are directly related to the functionality and rewrite operations of the `sign` function, as required by the issue. Additionally, the `Abs` class and its methods (`fdiff`, `_eval_derivative`) are relevant as they are involved in the rewrite operation of the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`. In the `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` file, the `refine_sign` function is relevant as it refines the `sign` function based on certain assumptions, which could be useful for handling zero values. The other files, like `sympy/printing/fcode.py`, seem less relevant to the issue at hand.",
