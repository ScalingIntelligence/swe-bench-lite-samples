The 'sign' function has an 'eval' method that handles various cases, including when the argument is zero, positive, or negative. The 'Abs' function also has an 'eval' method that handles similar cases. The relevance of these code spans to the reported issue is that they detail the current behavior of both functions and could be useful for refactoring the 'sign' function to be expressed in terms of 'Abs'. Specifically, the spans labeled 'sign.eval' and 'Abs.eval' are most relevant as they contain the evaluation logic for each function, which will be crucial for implementing the requested rewrite.",

Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
