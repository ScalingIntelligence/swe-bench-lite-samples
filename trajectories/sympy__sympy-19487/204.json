The main concern is handling the case where the argument is zero, as `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan`, but `sign(0)` currently returns `0`. Relevant files appear to be those where the `sign` and `Abs` functions are defined or used, including `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, `sympy/printing/fcode.py`, `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, and others. Key methods to look for are `_eval_rewrite_*` methods related to rewriting functions in terms of others and the `eval` class methods where function definitions might be.",

The current definition of `sign` is given as `sign(z) := z / Abs(z)` for all complex non-zero `z`. The issue also discusses how to handle the case when `z` is zero. In the search results, I found several relevant code spans in the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file. Specifically, I found the definition of the `sign` class and its methods, such as `_eval_is_nonnegative`, `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_Heaviside`. Additionally, I found the definition of the `Abs` class and its methods, including `eval`, `_eval_is_integer`, `_eval_is_zero`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_sign`. These code spans are relevant because they define the behavior of the `sign` and `Abs` functions and how they interact. The `Abs` class's methods give information on how to handle the absolute value of a number, which is crucial for rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`. The methods in the `sign` class show how the sign function is currently implemented and how it might be rewritten or simplified in different contexts. This information is necessary to address the issue of rewriting the `sign` function using `Abs`.",

The provided file context and search results contain the relevant definitions and methods for both 'sign' and 'Abs'. The file 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' contains the 'sign' class and its methods, while the 'Abs' class and its methods are also present in the same file. The search results include the 'sign' class definition and its 'eval' method, which currently handles the evaluation of the sign for different types of arguments. Additionally, the 'Abs' class definition and its 'fdiff' method show the relationship between 'Abs' and 'sign' (specifically that the derivative of 'Abs' with respect to its argument is 'sign').
