The 'sign' function's eval method handles various cases, including zero, positive, and negative values, but does not currently rewrite in terms of 'Abs'. The 'Abs' function is thoroughly defined and includes methods for evaluation and differentiation. Additionally, I observed a method '_eval_rewrite_as_Abs' in 'sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py' which hints at potential usage for rewriting functions in terms of 'Abs'. However, given the specific nature of the request and the need to handle zero correctly, further code additions or modifications to 'sign' or 'Abs' are likely needed.
