Additionally, `Abs._eval_rewrite_as_sign` shows a potential way to rewrite `Abs` in terms of `sign`, which could be useful for the inverse requirement. The `sign` function currently handles zero by returning zero, but the issue suggests it might need to return `nan` when rewritten in terms of `Abs`. Also, `sign` needs to handle the zero case explicitly in the rewrite method due to the division by zero scenario it might face. The provided code for `sign` and `Abs` in the search results confirms their existing implementation details.
