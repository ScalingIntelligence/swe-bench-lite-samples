The relevant code spans are identified in the `sign` class definition, particularly the `doit` and `eval` methods. The `doit` method handles the case where the argument is non-zero and returns the expression `self.args[0] / Abs(self.args[0])`. The `eval` method deals with special cases and simplifies the `sign` function for certain inputs. The `Abs` class is also relevant as it is the function in terms of which `sign` needs to be rewritten. The `sign` function's handling of zero is currently returning `S.Zero`, but the issue suggests it might be better to return `nan` or to be careful about the possibility of the argument being zero in the rewrite. There are no other sections of code in the search results that are directly relevant to rewriting `sign` as `Abs`.",

The current definition of `sign` in SymPy is `sign(z) := z / Abs(z)` for all complex non-zero `z`, but the current implementation does not handle the case where `z` is zero properly. The search results include relevant code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, `sympy/printing/fcode.py`, and `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`.\n\nThe relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` include the definition of the `sign` function (`span id='sign'`), its evaluation (`span id='sign.eval'`), and the implementation of the `Abs` function (`span id='Abs'`). These spans are directly related to the issue of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.\n\nThe `sympy/printing/fcode.py` file contains the `_print_sign` method in the `FCodePrinter` class, which handles printing of the `sign` function in Fortran code, but this is not directly related to the redefinition of `sign` in terms of `Abs`.\n\nThe `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py` file contains the `collect_abs` function, which might be indirectly related to the issue by simplifying expressions involving `Abs`, but it does not directly address the `sign` function.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` that define the `sign` and `Abs` functions.
