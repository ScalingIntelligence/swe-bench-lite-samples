The goal is to find sections of code where the `sign` function can potentially be rewritten using the `Abs` function, ensuring that special cases like `sign(0)` are handled correctly. Given the search results, the `sign` function is defined in the `sign` class of `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, and it includes an `eval` method that handles different cases of the input argument, including zero and non-zero complex numbers. Additionally, the `Abs` function is defined in the `Abs` class of the same file, which includes methods like `fdiff` that use `sign`. These sections are crucial for understanding the behavior of both functions and how they might interact. Also, the `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method in the `MinMaxBase` class of `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` should be considered, as it shows an example of rewriting another function (Min or Max) in terms of `Abs`, which could serve as a template or inspiration for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.",
