This involves finding the relevant definitions and implementations of both `sign` and `Abs` functions in the sympy codebase. From the search results, I identified the following key spans of code: 1. The `sign` function's definition and its `eval` method. 2. The `Abs` function's definition and its `fdiff` method, which uses `sign`. 3. The `sign._eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` method, which might be relevant for understanding how `sign` could be rewritten. Additionally, there's a mention of handling `sign(0)` differently, which could affect how a rewrite in terms of `Abs` is implemented. This analysis shows that the identified spans are directly relevant to the reported issue, providing the necessary context for understanding and potentially modifying the `sign` function to be expressed in terms of `Abs`.",
