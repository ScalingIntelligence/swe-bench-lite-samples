The current definition of `sign` involves dividing the argument by its absolute value. The issue also raises the question of handling `sign(0)`, which currently returns `0` but might need to return `nan` for consistency with the expression `0 / Abs(0)`. Given the context, it's important to identify sections of code related to the `sign`, `Abs`, and handling of zero values or division by zero. The provided search results include relevant files: `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py`. The spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` are particularly relevant, containing the current implementations of `sign`, `Abs`, and associated methods. These spans include `sign.eval`, `sign._eval_conjugate`, `Abs.eval`, `Abs.fdiff`, and `Abs._eval_derivative`. Additionally, `Abs._eval_derivative` is particularly interesting as it involves the `sign` function, suggesting a direct interaction between `Abs` and `sign`. Overall, the identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the existing implementation related to the `sign` and `Abs` functions, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue.",

Notably, the `sign` and `Abs` classes do not currently include a method for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`, which is central to the issue. This suggests the need to create or modify such a method within the `sign` class. Additionally, insights might be gained from examining other methods within these classes, particularly those handling expressions with complex behaviors or dealing with transform or rewrite operations. Furthermore, searching for examples or templates within the same directory or related directories could provide guidance on how to implement a 'rewrite' method for the 'sign' function in terms of 'Abs'.",

Specifically, reference the methods used in `Abs` for handling complex expressions and transformations, as well as templates used in similar functions. It might also be beneficial to review other projects or modules in SymPy that deal with symbolic expressions and applied transformations to gather more comprehensive strategies and examples."
