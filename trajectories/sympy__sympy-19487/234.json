The current implementation of `sign` in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` does not explicitly handle rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`, and there is a specific concern about handling the case when `z` is zero. The current behavior for `sign(0)` returns `0`, while `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan`, suggesting that perhaps `sign(0)` should also be `nan`. The relevant code spans include the definition and evaluation of both `sign` and `Abs` functions. These spans help in understanding how `sign` and `Abs` are currently implemented and evaluated, which is crucial for addressing the issue of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs` and handling the zero case appropriately.",
