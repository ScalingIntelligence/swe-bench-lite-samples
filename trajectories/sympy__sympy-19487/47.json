Other files like `sympy/printing/fcode.py`, `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, and `sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py` also contain direct references or related functions, such as `_print_sign` for printing and `refine_sign` for refinement.

The `sign` class contains methods such as `doit` and `eval` that define how the `sign` function behaves. Specifically, the `doit` method already contains the logic `self.args[0] / Abs(self.args[0])` which is relevant to the rewriting task. Additionally, the `Abs` class contains rewrite methods such as `_eval_rewrite_as_sign`, showing how `Abs` could be expressed in terms of `sign`. This bidirectional relationship is crucial for implementing the rewrite functionality. Other files like `sympy/printing/fcode.py` and `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` also reference the `sign` and `Abs` functions but are less directly related to the rewriting task described in the issue. I identified the relevant spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` that pertain to the `sign` and `Abs` functions, as these are the core components that would need modification to achieve the rewrite functionality as described in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Rewrite sign as abs\nIn sympy the `sign` function is defined as\r\n```\r\n    sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)\r\n```\r\nfor all complex non-zero `z`. There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                   \r\n x \r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\u2502x\u2502\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(0)                                                                                                                               \r\n0\r\n>>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                            \r\nnan\r\n```\r\nMaybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
