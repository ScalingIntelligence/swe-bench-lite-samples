The search results provide several key points including the definition of the `sign` and `Abs` classes, their methods, and related functionalities such as `conjugate` and `transpose`. The analysis reveals that the `sign` function currently does not have a `rewrite` method targeting `Abs`, and the handling of the case where the input is zero needs to be addressed. The current implementation of `sign(0)` returns 0, which differs from the `0 / Abs(0)` result of `nan`. Thus, modifications or additions to the `sign` class may be necessary to achieve the desired functionality. Additionally, the `Abs` class handles the absolute value of expressions, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand.",

The `sign` function definition and its `eval` method handling different cases like zero, positive, negative, and imaginary values.\n2. The `Abs` function definition and its methods like `fdiff`, `eval`, `_eval_nseries`, and `_eval_derivative`.\n3. The `MinMaxBase` class and its method `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` in the `miscellaneous` module, which also involves `Abs`.\n\nBased on the issue requirement, relevant code spans should include:\n- The `sign` class definition and its `eval` method for understanding current behavior and potential modifications.\n- The `Abs` class and its methods, particularly `fdiff` and `_eval_derivative`, which directly involve the `sign` function.\n- The `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method from `MinMaxBase`, although not directly related, suggests potential uses of `Abs` in other contexts.\n\nBy analyzing these sections, we can identify where and how to implement the rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs` and handle the zero case appropriately.",

The current evaluation of `sign` does not handle the case when `arg` is zero correctly. We also need to consider redefining `sign(0)` as `nan` or handling the zero case explicitly in the rewrite. In the current context, we have spans that define the `sign` function and its evaluation, including handling various cases such as zero, positive, and negative arguments. The new search results contain additional spans for the `sign.doit` method and various other evaluation and rewriting methods for the `sign` function. These additions are relevant as they help in understanding how `sign` can be modified to include the rewrite functionality. The search results include spans about `Abs`, which are crucial for the rewrite targets specified in the issue.\n\nGiven the current state and the new search results, we can identify relevant code spans that focus on the `sign` function's implementation and the `Abs` class's definition and usage. These spans cover the computation of `sign` in terms of `Abs`, handling zero cases, and other relevant functionalities that can be adapted to address the issue.",
