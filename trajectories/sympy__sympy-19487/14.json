The provided context suggests that the `sign` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` and is connected to the `Abs` function within the same file. Additionally, there is a mention of a method `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` in `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py`, which might suggest another place to look for rewrites. Considering these leads, the search should be focused on these two files.",

The issue also raises a question about how to handle the `sign(0)` case, which currently returns 0 but should perhaps return `nan` since 0 / Abs(0) results in `nan`. The search results include several relevant code spans, including the definition of the `sign` function and its various evaluation methods, the `Abs` function, and related functions. The `sign.eval` method handles the evaluation of the sign function, and the `sign.doit` method already contains the logic for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs` for non-zero arguments. The `Abs.eval` and `Abs._eval_rewrite_as_sign` methods may also be relevant for understanding how `Abs` is evaluated and rewritten. Given this information, the task seems to involve modifying the `sign` function to handle the zero case appropriately and possibly ensuring that the rewrite logic for `sign` in terms of `Abs` is correctly implemented and accessible.",

There is also a special case handling for zero in the `sign` class where `sign(0)` returns zero. This handling of zero needs revisiting based on the issue's suggestion. Additionally, the `Abs` class includes methods for differentiation and rewrites, including `_eval_rewrite_as_sign`, suggesting that further exploration in the codebase could be beneficial to address the rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs`. Given the presence of the `sign` and `Abs` class definitions, it appears that the provided file context is a good starting point for addressing the issue, but further investigation into other related methods and possibly other files (such as `miscellaneous.py`) would be necessary to fully address the issue.",
