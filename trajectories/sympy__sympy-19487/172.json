The `Abs` function is defined in the `Abs` span and includes important methods such as `eval`, `fdiff`, and `_eval_derivative`. Given the issue's requirement to rewrite `sign` in terms of `Abs`, the relevant spans include `sign.eval` where the current evaluation logic of `sign` is defined, and `Abs` and its methods where the `Abs` function is defined and key functionalities like differentiation and evaluation are implemented. These spans are crucial for understanding how `sign` and `Abs` currently interact and how they could be modified to achieve the desired rewrite. Furthermore, the current handling of zero in `sign` (where `sign(0)` returns 0) and the potential inconsistency when divided by `Abs(0)` also need to be addressed, suggesting a potential modification in the `sign.eval` span to handle zero cases appropriately.",

However, the `Abs` class method `eval` uses `signsimp` and `sign` in its logic, suggesting a possible interplay between these functions relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `Abs` class method `fdiff` returns `sign(self.args[0])`, implying a direct connection.

The current definition and behavior of `sign` and `Abs` are analyzed from the provided code spans.\n\n1. The `sign` function is defined in the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file. It has an `eval` method that handles different cases such as zero, positive, and negative arguments. It also has a `_eval_conjugate` method.\n\n2. The `Abs` function is also defined in the same file and has several methods including `fdiff`, `eval`, `_eval_nseries`, and `_eval_derivative`. The `Abs.fdiff` method is particularly relevant as it includes `sign(self.args[0])` in its return statement.\n\n3. The issue suggests that rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs` would involve modifying or adding a `rewrite` method to the `sign` class, which currently does not exist. This method should return the expression `x / Abs(x)` for non-zero `x`.\n\n4. Handling the edge case when `x` is zero needs careful consideration as `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan` but currently `sign(0)` returns `0`. The suggested solution is to make `sign(0)` return `nan`, which aligns with the mathematical definition but contradicts current behavior.\n\nGiven these insights, the task involves adding a `rewrite` method to the `sign` class and perhaps adjusting the `eval` method to return `nan` for zero input if that behavior is deemed appropriate.\n\nThe search results confirm the location of the `sign` and `Abs` classes, but do not directly offer a solution or existing `rewrite` method implementation. Further action is needed to implement the suggested change in terms of `Abs`.",

Relevant code spans include:\n     - The definition of the `sign` class.\n     - The `eval` method of the `sign` class.\n     - The `_eval_conjugate` method of the `sign` class.\n   - The `Abs` function is also defined in this file. Relevant code spans include:\n     - The definition of the `Abs` class.\n     - The `eval` method of the `Abs` class.\n     - The `_eval_derivative` method of the `Abs` class.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Code in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`:**\n   - The `signsimp` function in this file simplifies expressions involving the `sign` function. This might be relevant for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.\n\n4. **Rewrite the `sign` Function:**\n   - Modify the `sign` function to handle the case when `z` is zero, ensuring that `sign(0)` returns `nan`.\n   - Ensure that the `sign` function is rewritten in terms of `Abs` for all non-zero `z`.\n\n5. **Test the New Implementation:**\n   - Verify that the new implementation correctly handles the rewriting of `sign` in terms of `Abs` and appropriately handles the case when `z` is zero.\n\nBy following these steps, the task of rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs` in SymPy can be completed.",

From the `file_context`, it's evident that `sign` and `Abs` are defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, with `sign` possessing methods like `eval` and `_eval_conjugate`, and `Abs` having methods like `eval` and `_eval_derivative`. There is no explicit `rewrite` method for `sign`, indicating a necessary addition to facilitate the desired functionality.
