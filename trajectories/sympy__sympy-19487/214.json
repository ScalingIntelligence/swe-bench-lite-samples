The `sign` function also has specific behaviors for zero and other special cases. In the context of rewriting, the `MinMaxBase._eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method shows an example of how a function can be rewritten in terms of `Abs`. Additionally, the `Abs` function's definition and its methods, such as `fdiff`, were examined to understand how `Abs` interacts with other functions.
