The main concern is how to handle the case when the argument is zero, where `sign(0)` currently returns 0, but rewriting it as `0 / Abs(0)` results in `NaN`. It's suggested that `sign(0)` might also need to return `NaN` to maintain consistency. The relevant classes and functions to focus on are `sign` and `Abs` within sympy's function modules, particularly `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`.",
