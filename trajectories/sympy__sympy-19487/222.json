            "scratch_pad": "To address the issue of rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs` in SymPy, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with the `sign` and `Abs` functions. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the `sign` function definition and evaluation logic:**\n   - The `sign` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, specifically in the `sign` class. It includes methods for `eval` and `_eval_conjugate`.\n   - The `eval` method handles various cases, such as zero, positive, negative, and imaginary arguments. This is crucial for understanding how `sign` currently behaves.\n\n2. **Identify the `Abs` function definition and evaluation logic:**\n   - The `Abs` function is also defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, in the `Abs` class. It includes methods like `fdiff`, `_eval_nseries`, and `_eval_derivative`.\n   - The `fdiff` method returns `sign(self.args[0])`, which shows a direct relationship between `Abs` and `sign`.\n\n3. **Assess the potential for rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`:**\n   - The `sign` function's `eval` method does not currently use `Abs` directly. However, the mathematical definition of `sign(z) = z / Abs(z)` suggests that this relation could be programmatically implemented.\n\n4. **Consider edge cases and special handling:**\n   - The discussion in the issue notes the behavior when `arg` is zero. Currently, `sign(0)` returns `0`, while `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan`.\n   - This suggests that the rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs` needs careful handling of the zero case.\n\n5. **Other relevant functions and classes:**\n   - The `MinMaxBase` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` has a method `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` which uses `Abs`, indicating a broader context in which `Abs` is used.\n   - The `refine_sign` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` also deals with `sign`, suggesting potential integration points for refining the behavior of `sign`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the spans relevant to the issue are those involving the `sign` and `Abs` functions, particularly the `eval` methods in their respective classes.",
