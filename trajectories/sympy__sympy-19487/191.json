From the context provided, the `sign` function is defined in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' and potentially handled in 'sympy/printing/fcode.py', 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py', and 'sympy/series/gruntz.py'. The `Abs` function is also relevant and is defined in 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py'. To address the issue, we need to search these files for the `sign` and `Abs` functions, and also look for any specific handling of these functions, especially with respect to zero, as the current behavior discrepancy (`sign(0)` returning 0 instead of `nan`) is a central concern. The search should focus on these specific functions and their handling in the mentioned files.",

The search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file: \n1. The `sign` class is defined, including its `eval`, and `doit` methods. These methods handle the evaluation and computation of the sign function for different types of arguments, such as zero, positive, negative, and imaginary numbers.\n2. The `Abs` class is also defined, with methods like `_eval_rewrite_as_sign`, which shows how to rewrite `Abs` in terms of `sign`. This suggests that the reverse might be needed, i.e., rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.\nThese findings cover the essential aspects related to the `sign` and `Abs` functions. They provide a basis for implementing the requested rewrite capability for `sign` in terms of `Abs`, especially considering the handling of zero as a special case. Additional attention might be needed to ensure that rewriting `sign` as `Abs` does not lead to undefined behavior (like division by zero). The code spans included are sufficient for understanding the current implementation and for planning the necessary modifications or improvements to address the issue.\n\nBased on these analyses, the identified code spans are relevant to address the issue of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`, and handling the case where the argument is zero.",
