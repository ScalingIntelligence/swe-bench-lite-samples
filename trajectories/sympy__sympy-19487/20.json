The key files to look into are those related to the `sign` and `Abs` functions. Two primary search parameters are significant: locating the `sign` class and its methods, particularly those related to evaluation and rewriting, and identifying where the `rewrite` method for `sign` might be defined or used. Additionally, considering the edge case of `sign(0)` should be `nan`, the behavior around zero input needs careful handling.",

This is clear from the partial implementation, where zero handling is not aligned with the proposed change. Additionally, the `Abs` class's `eval` method is also found, which can be helpful for further implementations. Other relevant files show how the sign function is handled in different contexts (like in assumptions and printing), but the primary focus for the issue should be the core definition of the sign and Abs functions.

The `sign` function is currently defined to return the sign of a complex number, and the `Abs` function computes the absolute value. The reported issue suggests that `sign(z)` should be rewritten as `z / Abs(z)` for all complex non-zero `z`. The current handling of `sign(0)` returns `0`, but the issue proposes that it might be better to return `nan` instead. The relevant code spans are those that define the `sign` function and its evaluation logic, as well as the `Abs` function and its interactions. From the provided search results, the relevant spans are those that define these functions and their methods. Additionally, it's important to note the handling of special cases like zero in the `sign` function's `eval` method.
