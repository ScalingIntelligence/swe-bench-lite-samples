Relevant files and functions have been identified, particularly focusing on the `sign` class in `complexes.py` and the `Abs` class in the same file. A specific method `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` is needed within the `sign` class to handle this transformation correctly. Additionally, special handling for the case when `x` is zero needs to be considered, which may involve modifying the `eval` method for the `sign` class.",

The key requirement is to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of the `Abs` function, taking into account the possibility of the argument being zero. I then examined the provided search results to identify relevant code spans. The code spans related to the `sign` function include its `eval`, `doit`, and other methods. The `Abs` function is also covered with its `eval` and `fdiff` methods. Additionally, there are code spans for related functions such as `re`, `im`, `conjugate`, and `arg` which might be indirectly relevant. The code spans relevant to the `sign` function directly reflect the current implementation and how it calculates the sign based on the absolute value. The `Abs` function's methods show how the absolute value is evaluated and differentiated. Based on this analysis, I identified the following relevant code spans from the search results:",

There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                   \r\n x \r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\u2502x\u2502\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(0)                                                                                                                               \r\n0\r\n>>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                            \r\nnan\r\n```\r\nMaybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
