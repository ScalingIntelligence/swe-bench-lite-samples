The search results provide important context, particularly in the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file, where both the `sign` and `Abs` functions are defined. The `sign` function has several methods that evaluate properties such as non-negativity, non-positivity, and imaginary status, as well as rewriting capabilities as `Piecewise`. Additionally, the `Abs` function has methods to rewrite itself in terms of `Heaviside`, `Piecewise`, `sign`, and `conjugate`. These methods are crucial for understanding how to potentially implement the rewrite of `sign` in terms of `Abs` while considering the zero case. The provided code spans are relevant as they directly relate to the functionality and properties of the `sign` and `Abs` functions necessary to address the reported issue.",
