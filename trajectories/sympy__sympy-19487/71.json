The `sign` function definition, its evaluation logic, and the `Abs` function's derivative are particularly relevant as they are directly related to the functionality involved in the issue. The `sign.eval` span is relevant for understanding how the `sign` function is currently evaluated, while the `Abs._eval_derivative` span is relevant for understanding how the `Abs` function is used in derivatives. The `Basic.rewrite` span in `sympy/core/basic.py` is also relevant as it pertains to the general rewrite mechanism in SymPy, which is used to rewrite expressions in terms of other functions. The other spans, such as those in `sympy/combinatorics/fp_groups.py` and `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, appear to be unrelated to the issue of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.",

Although there is no explicit `rewrite` method provided for the `sign` function in the context, the structure of these definitions seems to encapsulate the core logic needed for implementing such a rewrite. Additionally, the setup of the `rewrite` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` indicates the generic approach for method implementation, which aligns with the nature of SymPy's flexible method definitions.

There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                   \r\n x \r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\u2502x\u2502\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(0)                                                                                                                               \r\n0\r\n>>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                            \r\nnan\r\n```\r\nMaybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).\n"
