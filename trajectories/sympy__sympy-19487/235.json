This method handles the evaluation of the `sign` function and includes logic for handling multiplication, imaginary numbers, and comparisons.\n\nThe `Abs` function is also in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, within the `Abs.eval` class method. This method evaluates the absolute value of its argument, considering various scenarios like handling special cases and factoring terms.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the relevant code spans appears to be:\n- `sign.eval` for understanding the current implementation of the `sign` function.\n- `Abs.eval` for understanding how the `Abs` function is defined and used in the codebase.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the `Function` class in `sympy/core/function.py` will provide context on how functions in SymPy are generally handled and instantiated.\n\nThese code spans will help in ascertaining the current behavior of the `sign` and `Abs` functions and could be useful for implementing the requested functionality of rewriting `sign` in terms of `Abs`.",

Additionally, considering the structure of the 'sign' and 'Abs' functions, we might need to manually implement the rewrite by adding a new method within the 'sign' class, possibly named '_eval_rewrite_as_Abs', which handles the rewrite logic to express 'sign' in terms of 'Abs'.
