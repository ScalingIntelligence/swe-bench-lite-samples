The relevant components identified in the search results include the `sign` class and its methods such as `doit`, `eval`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise`. Additionally, the `Abs` class and its methods like `eval`, `_eval_rewrite_as_sign`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` are relevant. The challenge is to handle the special case when the argument is zero, as currently `sign(0)` returns 0 while `0 / Abs(0)` yields NaN. This discrepancy needs to be addressed either by making `sign(0)` return NaN or by carefully handling the zero case during the rewrite to Abs.\n\nTo address this issue, the following steps could be considered:\n1. Update the `sign` class's `doit` method to handle the zero case explicitly by returning NaN when the argument is zero.\n2. Modify the `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` method in the `sign` class to include a condition for zero, returning NaN directly or through a Piecewise structure.\n3. Check the `eval` method of the `sign` class to ensure it correctly identifies the zero case.\n4. Review the `_eval_rewrite_as_sign` and `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` methods in the `Abs` class to ensure they are mutually consistent with the `sign` function's behavior, particularly around zero.\n\nGiven the complexity of handling zero in these functions, a thorough testing strategy should be devised to ensure the rewrite operation behaves as expected across various input scenarios.",
