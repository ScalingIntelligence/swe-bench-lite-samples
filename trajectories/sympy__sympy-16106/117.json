This issue indicates a flaw in the `_print_Basic` method of the `MathMLPrinter` class, which tries to iterate over the `Indexed` object. The relevant code spans in the provided search results include definition and handling of the `Indexed` class and its associated `IndexedBase`. These classes are directly related to the indexing behavior that seems to be causing the issue. The `Indexed.__new__` method is crucial as it constructs the `Indexed` object, and the `IndexedBase.__getitem__` method is important because it defines how an `Indexed` object is accessed, which is central to the issue described. The `Indexed._eval_derivative` method, while not directly related to MathML printing, could hint at further complexity in how `Indexed` objects are handled, potentially relevant for a comprehensive fix. Finally, the `Idx` class defines the index label for the indexing, which is logically related to the `Indexed` class.",
