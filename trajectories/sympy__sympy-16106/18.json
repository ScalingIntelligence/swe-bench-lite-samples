This suggests a problem with how the `Indexed` object is handled in the MathML printer. The search results provide implementations of the `_print_Indexed` method across various printers, including `JuliaCodePrinter`, `LatexPrinter`, `RCodePrinter`, `C89CodePrinter`, `GLSLPrinter`, `FCodePrinter`, `LLVMJitCallbackPrinter`, `JavascriptCodePrinter`, `RustCodePrinter`, and `OctaveCodePrinter`. These implementations could be relevant to fixing the issue in the MathML printer, as they demonstrate how different printers handle the `Indexed` object. However, the actual MathML printer (`MathMLContentPrinter` and `MathMLPresentationPrinter`) does not have a `_print_Indexed` method implemented, which matches the error described in the issue. This suggests that the MathML printer lacks the necessary implementation to handle `Indexed` objects, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to iterate over them. Therefore, the identified spans from other printers can serve as a reference to implement the missing functionality in the MathML printer.",

Consequently, it is evident that the issue is not one of the method's absence but potentially improper handling or a missing implementation within the `mathml.py` module or additional oversight concerning the interaction between the `Indexed` class and its printer methods in MathML context. So, the focus should shift towards reviewing and correcting the method where it seems to have failed; specifically within the `mathml.py` module where the iteration error occurs. It might also be beneficial to cross-reference the correct behavior from other modules like `latex.py` where `_print_Indexed` is correctly implemented to ensure proper MathML representation.",
