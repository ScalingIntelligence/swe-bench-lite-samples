The traceback indicates that the problematic line is `for arg in e:` in the `_print_Basic` method of `MathMLContentPrinter`. This suggests that the `Indexed` object is not being handled correctly in the MathML printing process.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the `Indexed` class in the MathML printer and potentially other printers for comparison or guidance. The search results show various implementations of `_print_Indexed` across different printers (e.g., LaTeX, GLSL, Rust, Julia, LLVMJit, C89, Fortran, R, Octave, and Javascript). Comparing these implementations can help identify how `Indexed` objects are typically handled and how this might be adapted for the MathML printer.\n\nThe most relevant files and spans appear to be in `sympy/printing/mathml.py` (specifically the `MathMLContentPrinter` class and its methods) and potentially `sympy/printing/latex.py`, as the LaTeX printer has a direct `_print_Indexed` method. The other printers' implementations of `_print_Indexed` can serve as reference but are less directly relevant to the issue at hand.",
