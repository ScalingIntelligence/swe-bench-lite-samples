The provided search results include various code printers like LaTeX, Julia, R, GLSL, C89, JavaScript, FCode, LLVMJITCallback, Octave, and Rust, each containing implementations for printing 'Indexed' objects. Given the specific error, the relevant code spans are those that explicitly handle 'Indexed' objects in the printers.
