The error specifically occurs in the _print_Basic method of the MathMLPrinter, where it attempts to iterate over an `Indexed` object which is not iterable. The search results include relevant sections from sympy/printing/latex.py and sympy/tensor/indexed.py. In sympy/printing/latex.py, the `LatexPrinter` class contains methods for handling `Indexed` and `IndexedBase` objects. The `_print_Indexed` and `_print_IndexedBase` methods are explicitly defined for LaTeX printing but not for MathML printing. This indicates a potential gap in the MathML printer's support for these objects. In sympy/tensor/indexed.py, the `Indexed` and `IndexedBase` classes are defined with relevant properties and methods. The `Indexed` class specifically addresses the issue by handling the creation and properties of indexed objects, such as base and indices. This context suggests that the MathML printer needs a similar implementation to handle `Indexed` and `IndexedBase` objects to avoid the TypeError. The identified spans are relevant as they provide the necessary context and structure for implementing or adapting the MathML printer to handle `Indexed` and `IndexedBase` objects.",
