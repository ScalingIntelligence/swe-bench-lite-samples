Analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `LatexPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/latex.py` and the `CodePrinter` class within `sympy/printing/codeprinter.py`. The methods `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` in these classes handle the printing of multiplication and power expressions in LaTeX format, respectively. The `_print_Mul` method in `LatexPrinter` contains logic to handle bracket placement and fraction rendering, which is crucial for addressing the issue with nested fractions and missing brackets. The `_print_Pow` method in the same class also has relevant logic for rendering powers, which might need adjustment to ensure correct bracket placement.

This discrepancy is due to missing parentheses in the denominator.\n\nThe current file context provided is sympy/printing/latex.py. Reviewing the search results, I found that the LatexPrinter class contains methods _print_Mul and _print_Pow, which are likely candidates for addressing the parsing issue. The _print_Mul method uses functions from sympy.simplify to handle the parsing of fractions and multiplication, while _print_Pow handles powers. These methods are likely where adjustments would be made to fix the incorrect parsing.\n\nI will extract relevant code spans from the provided search results to address the reported issue.
