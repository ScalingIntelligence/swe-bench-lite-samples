The key point is the incorrect handling of the denominator fraction, causing incorrect expression formation.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans in 'sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py', specifically in the 'convert_frac' function. This function is responsible for converting LaTeX fractions into SymPy expressions. The analysis of 'convert_frac' shows that it correctly constructs the numerator ('expr_top') and the denominator ('expr_bot') but fails to properly encapsulate the denominator expression within brackets. This oversight could be the cause of the reported issue. The 'convert_frac' function involves the computation of 'expr_top' and 'expr_bot', followed by the formation of 'inverse_denom' using 'sympy.Pow(expr_bot, -1, evaluate=False)' and then forming the final\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f with 'sympy.Mul(expr_top, inverse_denom, evaluate=False)'. This process likely needs adjustments to ensure proper encapsulation of the denominator fraction.",
