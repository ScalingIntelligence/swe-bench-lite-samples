The example provided shows an attempt to override the method in a custom model, but it fails to work as expected in Django 2.2+. The search results focus on Django's model classes and field implementations. Notably, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` contains the `__init__` method which initializes model instances, possibly affecting how field display methods work. Similarly, the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` includes initialization logic that might influence custom field methods. These code spans appear relevant as they could provide insights into Django's handling of model fields and their display methods, potentially leading to understanding the changes in behavior from 2.1 to 2.2. Further investigation into these areas could be crucial for resolving the issue.",

It works in version 2.1.\nExample:\nclass FooBar(models.Model):\n\tfoo_bar = models.CharField(_(\"foo\"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1\n\tdef get_foo_bar_display(self):\n\t\treturn \"something\"\nWhat I expect is that I should be able to override this function.\n"
