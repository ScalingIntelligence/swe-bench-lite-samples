Given that the issue could involve changes in Django's internal handling of model methods, particularly in how model fields are accessed and displayed, it would be beneficial to focus on the newer versions and potentially any release notes or documented changes related to model overrides. Since files related to model handling and field display have already been identified, it's plausible that further investigation into the specific changes introduced in Django 2.2 that might affect these functionalities is necessary. It might also be useful to look into compatibility layers or deprecation notes in Django's upgrade guides if available.",

The issue example suggests that the overridden method does not take effect as it did in Django 2.1. The search results contain the code for the Model class in Django's base.py, which includes the _get_FIELD_display method. This method is used internally by Django for displaying the value of a field with choices. The method extracts the value of the field and converts it using the force_str function. Given the issue, the relevant code spans that could help understand the issue and potentially modify the behavior include the entire Model class definition, especially the _get_FIELD_display method. Additionally, the __init__ method is provided for context on how the Model class is initialized, which might indirectly affect the behavior of get_FIELD_display. The other methods in the Model class are also relevant as they provide a complete picture of the Model's functionality and how the display methods might interact with other model operations. Therefore, the identified spans include the entire Model class for a comprehensive understanding and potential modifications.",
