The main concern is that the custom implementation of `get_foo_bar_display` is not being respected in Django 2.2. To investigate this, we should focus on the changes in Django's internal method resolution order (MRO) for model methods or any changes in the core `get_FIELD_display` function logic between versions 2.1 and 2.2. We can start by searching for the `get_FIELD_display` method in the `django/db/models/base.py` file and other related model files to understand how it works and why it might not be overridden as expected in version 2.2.",

The provided context and search results focus on the `Model` class within Django's `base.py`. The `Model` class is a fundamental part of Django's ORM, and the `__init__` method is crucial for object initialization. Since the issue involves overriding a method related to field display, it's plausible that the change in Django 2.2+ might be related to how the `Model` class handles instance initialization and method resolution. The provided search results do not directly address the issue of overriding `get_FOO_display()`, but understanding the `Model` class's initialization and its relationship with fields might provide some insights into what changed between versions 2.1 and 2.2. Given the complexity and the need to trace how fields and their display methods are handled within the `Model` class, further analysis of the entire `Model` class code might be necessary to pinpoint the exact change that prevents overriding `get_FOO_display()`.
