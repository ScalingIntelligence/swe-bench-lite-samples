The provided example shows a custom method `get_foo_bar_display` that doesn't seem to work as expected in Django 2.2, as compared to Django 2.1. The problem could be related to changes in how Django handles model field display methods starting from version 2.2. To investigate this, I'll focus on the `django/db/models/base.py` file, which contains the base `Model` class implementation. Additionally, I'll look into `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` where the `Field` class is defined. These files should provide insight into how field display methods are managed and possibly overridden in Django models.",

The example provided shows a custom implementation of `get_foo_bar_display()` in a model class, which is intended to override the default behavior of `get_FIELD_display()`. The main focus is on understanding the changes in behavior of this function between Django 2.1 and 2.2, and identifying if there are specific changes in the Django source code that might explain this difference. The search results provide a detailed look into the `Field` class and its subclasses within Django's models framework. Notably, the `Field` class definition, including its `__init__` method and other key methods like `get_choices`, are present in the search results. These areas are crucial as they provide context for how Django handles model fields, including those with choices, which is central to the issue at hand. By examining these sections, we can better understand how the `get_FIELD_display()` method might interact with or be affected by the field definitions and behaviors in Django 2.2. The `Field` class definition and its `__init__` method are directly relevant, while methods like `get_choices` are also indirectly related to how the display value might be determined for fields with choices. Specific subclasses like `IntegerField`, `SmallIntegerField`, and `TextField` are also included in the results, although they do not directly contain the `get_FIELD_display` method, they contribute to understanding the broader framework of Django's handling of fields.",
