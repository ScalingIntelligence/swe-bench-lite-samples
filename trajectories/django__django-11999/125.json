In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `_get_FIELD_display` method definition: This method is crucial for displaying field choices and could be the target for overriding, suggesting this span is relevant to the issue.\n2. In `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`, the `display_for_field` function: This function handles how fields are displayed in the admin interface, which is indirectly related to the issue.\n3. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class and its methods: This class is the base for all field types in Django models, possibly affecting how `get_FIELD_display` can be overridden.\n\nGiven these findings, the search task can be considered complete with the identified relevant code spans.",
