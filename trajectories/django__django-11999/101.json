Given the description and examples provided, it's clear that the problem lies in the behavior change of this function between Django versions. To find the relevant code and understand why the override is not working in Django 2.2+, focus on model definitions and the `get_FIELD_display` function implementation in the `django/db/models/base.py` file, as well as related functions in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. Additionally, check for any changes or updates in the `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` as it might provide clues about how field display is managed in Django 2.2.",
