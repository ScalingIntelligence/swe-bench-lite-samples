This function is essential for customizing the display of model field choices. The main focus is on identifying any constraints or changes in Django's Model class that might prevent this method from being overridden.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several code spans are closely related to the issue. Specifically, the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method in the `django/db/models/base.py` file is the core part of the functionality in question. Additionally, the `Model.__init__` method is also relevant as it initializes the model instance and could potentially affect how the `_get_FIELD_display` method is handled.\n\nOther spans, such as `_get_non_gfk_field` and `display_for_field` in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`, are related to field handling and display logic but are not directly linked to the overriding issue. However, they provide context on how fields and their displays are generally managed in Django.\n\nThe remaining code spans in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py` are more general and do not directly address the overriding issue at hand.\n\nGiven the context provided, the relevant code spans are primarily in `django/db/models/base.py`, specifically `Model._get_FIELD_display` and `Model.__init__`.

This issue is particularly focused on how the get_FIELD_display method works within Django's Model class. From the provided context and search results, we can follow these steps to identify relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n1. **Analyzing the Issue**: The user wants to override get_FIELD_display for a specific field in a model, but this functionality has changed or is not working as expected in Django 2.2+. This implies that the method definition or its behavior in the Model class might have undergone changes.\n\n2. **Reviewing Current Context**: The file context provides two relevant spans from `django/db/models/base.py`: `Model.__init__` and `Model._get_FIELD_display`. The `__init__` function sets up the model object, while `_get_FIELD_display` is directly related to the method the user wants to override.\n\n3. **Processing New Search Results**: The search results include additional files and spans that might be related due to their proximity to similar functionalities.\n\n   - `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`: Contains utility functions that might have implications for how fields are displayed in the admin interface, which is relevant since the issue contrasts Django 2.1 and 2.2 behavior.\n   - `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`: Functions and classes here assist in operations around admin views, suggesting potential modifications in how admin displays might have impacted the functionality.\n   - `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`: This file houses the Field class and other field types that are critical when dealing with individual model fields and their behaviors, including choices and display logic.\n\n4. **Identifying Relevant Code Spans**: Looking at the `Model._get_FIELD_display` (in base.py) and related functions like `display_for_field` and `label_for_field` (in django/contrib/admin/utils.py) gives specific instances where changes could affect the overridden method's success.\n\nTherefore, focusing on these sections would help in pinpointing where and how the functionality from Django 2.1 differs in Django 2.2+, which could be causing the user's reported issue.",

From django/db/models/base.py, the `Model` class contains a private method `_get_FIELD_display` which is responsible for retrieving the display value for a field with choices. This suggests that the internal logic for handling field display might have undergone changes in Django 2.2 that affect the field's display method. Additionally, django/contrib/admin/util.py includes functions related to field display handling and could also offer insights into how Django Admin handles such displays. Since the provided context does not explicitly point to the exact issue or changes in Django 2.2, it's prudent to continue investigating the release notes and changelogs between Django 2.1 and 2.2, focusing on backward-incompatible changes or notes related to model field display handling. Furthermore, checking the Django issue tracker and community forums could provide insights into whether this is a known issue or if there are community-provided workarounds.",
