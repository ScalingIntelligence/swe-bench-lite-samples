The user provided an example where they override the get_foo_bar_display method in a model, but it doesn't take effect in Django 2.2. To address this, I should focus on the Django core files related to model definitions and field handling to understand how the get_FIELD_display method is managed in Django 2.2. Specifically, I should look at files like base.py, options.py, and fields/__init__.py which handle model and field definitions, and potentially admin-related files if the issue has any impact on admin functionality.",

This function is a built-in method in Django models to get the human-readable value of a field with choices. The search results show the implementation of the Model class in Django's base.py file. Specifically, the span with id 'Model._get_FIELD_display' contains the implementation of the _get_FIELD_display method which is used internally by Django to handle the display of field choices. This method could be relevant to the issue as it shows where the default behavior for displaying field choices is defined in Django. Thus, it could help in understanding why overriding the method in user code might not be working as expected in version 2.2+. Additionally, the span 'Model.__init__' is included as it shows the initialization process of the Model class, which could also be related to the issue if the initialization or assignment of fields is different in version 2.2+.
