However, the specific method 'get_FIELD_display' does not directly appear in the provided code snippets. Given that 'get_FIELD_display' is not explicitly present, it's possible that this method is handled by Django's ORM or within a specific method not shown here.

The user provided an example of trying to override this function in a model with a CharField that has choices. The expected behavior is to be able to override this function, which works in Django 2.1 but not in 2.2+.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are primarily located in Django's `fields` and `models` modules. Particularly, the `Field` class and its subclasses in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` are crucial as they define the behavior of fields in Django models. Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` plays a significant role as it is the base class for all Django models, containing the logic for initializing models and handling deferred fields.\n\nIn the search results, the `CharField` class and its `__init__` method are highlighted, as the user's example involves a `CharField` with choices. Also, the `Field.__init__` method is essential as it sets up various properties of a field that could affect the ability to override `get_FIELD_display`. Furthermore, the `Model` class and its methods such as `_get_pk_val` and `get_deferred_fields` are relevant as they provide context on how model instances are managed and how field values are accessed.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the key spans identified are `Field.__init__`, `CharField`, and the `Model` class methods that deal with field access and model instance management. These spans provide a sufficient context to understand the potential reasons for the issue and how fields and models are handled in Django.",

Analyzed User Instructions:\n   The reported issue is about being unable to override the `get_FIELD_display()` function on models since Django 2.2, which worked in Django 2.1. The example provided shows an attempt to override `get_foo_bar_display()` on a model.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\n   The provided file context primarily consists of code related to model initialization and field definitions. There are no direct references to `get_FIELD_display()` within these spans.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n   3.1 Analyzed each code span in the <search_results> tag.\n   3.2 Identified the presence of `_get_FIELD_display` in the `django/db/models/base.py` file, which is likely the function being referred to as `get_FIELD_display` in the models.\n        _get_FIELD_display source code span link: `django/db/models/base.py#Model__get_FIELD_display`_/\n   3.3 The context of this function may be relevant, as this is a direct match to the method being overridden.\n   3.4 None of the other spans in the search results directly pertain to the issue of overriding `get_FIELD_display()`.\n        \n4.

Specifically, the `Model` class in `base.py` contains the method `_get_FIELD_display` which is likely the base implementation that users are trying to override. Additionally, the `Field` class in `fields/__init__.py` is relevant as it is the parent class for various field types, including `CharField`, `BooleanField`, and others. However, the issue seems to be more about the Django version's behavior rather than a specific bug in the provided code spans.
