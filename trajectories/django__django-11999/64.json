The current context provided includes a section from `django/db/models/base.py` which defines the `Model` class and its `__init__` method, among other things. The new search results include more detailed code spans from `django/db/models/base.py`, specifically the `Deferred` class and the `Model` class, focusing on the `_get_FIELD_display` method. This method is crucial as it encapsulates the logic for how Django handles the display of field values with choices. Additionally, there are relevant spans from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` that define the `Field` and `ForeignObjectRel` classes, respectively. These classes are relevant because they provide the foundational behavior of fields in Django models, including how choices are set and managed.
