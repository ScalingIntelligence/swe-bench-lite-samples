The `get_FIELD_display` functionality is central to how Django handles choice fields in models. The absence of direct mentions in the initial search suggests that the method overriding might be handled implicitly or through a different mechanism in Django 2.2+. To narrow down the search, we should focus on the `Options` class since it manages model options and meta-settings, which could influence how field methods are accessed and overridden. Additionally, examining the `Field` class more closely, particularly methods related to field display like `get_choices`, could provide insights into how the display values are managed.",
