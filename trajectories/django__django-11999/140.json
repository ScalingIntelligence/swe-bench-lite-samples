The search results provided include code from 'django/db/models/base.py', which is highly relevant as it pertains to the core functionality of Django models and includes imports and the Model class implementation. The Model class initializes model instances, handling fields and keyword arguments, which could influence how get_FIELD_display is treated in newer versions. Absent specific code about get_FIELD_display, the search results hint at the broader context where such overrides might fail due to changes in field handling or initialization. However, further exploration into how get_FIELD_display is defined and handled in Django 2.2+ would be necessary to pinpoint exact changes or constraints that prevent overriding.",

The method in question (`get_FIELD_display`) is used to retrieve a display value for a model field with choices, which can be overridden by users for customization purposes. The absence of immediate results suggests that the change might be subtle or indirectly implemented through a change in a depended-upon method or configuration. Reviewing the `Model` class's method overrides and the way fields are initialized and managed in `django/db/models/base.py` might still be relevant, as changes in these areas can affect how methods like `get_FIELD_display` are inherited and used in subclasses. Additionally, focusing on how Django handles field initialization and relations in the newer versions might lead to identifying the specific change that affects the overriding mechanism.",

Upon examining the provided code, particularly within the 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/options.py' files, key sections of the Django model definition and its options are revealed. These sections include the Model class initialization and the Options class handling metadata for models. The issue likely involves changes to how method overriding is handled within the Model class or how certain fields are managed in the Options class. Specifically, the Model.__init__ span reveals the initialization process for Django models, which could be where any change affecting method overriding might occur. The Options class spans, such as setup_pk and setup_proxy, offer insights into how model options are configured, potentially influencing field handling and method availability. Given the context of the issue and the code provided, these sections are likely areas of focus for diagnosing and potentially addressing the inability to override the get_FIELD_display() method in Django 2.2+.",

The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` deals with model options and fields but does not explicitly address the custom implementation of `get_FIELD_display()`. Given the nature of the issue, which suggests a change in behavior from Django 2.1 to 2.2, it is plausible that the change might be due to a deeper, more systemic alteration in Django's handling of model methods or fields upon initialization or modification. To fully address the issue, further investigation should focus on Django's release notes for version 2.2, exploring what changes were introduced that might affect model method overriding, and how these changes interact with the Model and Options classes.

The `Model` class in `django.db.models.base` includes methods for initializing models and setting their states, which could be related to the overridability issue mentioned. Additionally, the `Options` class in `django.db.models.options` manages metadata for models, including fields and ordering.
