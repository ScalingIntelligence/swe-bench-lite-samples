The search results provide an in-depth look at the `Model` class within Django's `base.py`, which is where such methods would be defined or affected. The relevant code spans include the imports necessary for constructing models and the actual implementation of the `Model` class, specifically the `__init__` method where field initialization and attribute setting occur. This context is crucial as it might relate to how the `get_FIELD_display` method is handled or could be overridden. However, the direct method `get_foo_bar_display` mentioned in the issue is not found in the provided search results, suggesting more research is needed or the code might be in another part of the Django codebase. Although, understanding how fields and attributes are set and what signals are sent (like `pre_init` and `post_init`) could provide insights into why overriding the method might fail in Django 2.2+. Thus, the current search results give valuable context to start further investigation but do not necessarily provide a direct solution due to the lack of the specific method in the search results.",
