In `django/db/models/base.py`, there's a `Model` class definition with an `__init__` method that initializes model instances. This could be relevant because overriding the display method might involve manipulating how model instances are initialized or how fields are accessed. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, there are definitions for various field types that extend the `Field` class, which could also be relevant to understanding how field display values are managed. Finally, `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` contains utility functions including `display_for_field`, which might be used to customize how field values are displayed according to choices or types.

The user provided an example model class `FooBar` with a field `foo_bar` having choices. They attempted to override the `get_foo_bar_display` method but found it doesn't work as expected in Django 2.2. Examining the current file context, there isn't direct evidence of how Django handles the `get_FIELD_display` method specifically. However, I can infer from the search results that any relevant code would likely be in the `django/db/models` directory, as this contains the `Model` class definition and related field definitions. Additionally, the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file contains functions related to displaying field values, which could be relevant. From the search results, I'll identify code spans that could help understand how `get_FIELD_display` is implemented or how it can be overridden. This includes looking at the `Model` class definition and any related field classes within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`.",
