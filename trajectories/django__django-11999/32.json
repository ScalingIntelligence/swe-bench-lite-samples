This span encapsulates the constructor logic, including attribute setting and handling of related objects, which could be related to how field display methods are handled or overridden.

Comparing this method between Django versions 2.1 and 2.2 is crucial for understanding any changes that may impact the ability to override `get_FIELD_display`.

The example provided demonstrates a user's attempt to override this function in a model, which worked in Django 2.1 but fails in 2.2. The primary focus of the search is to identify the relevant code spans in the Django source that might explain why this override is unsuccessful in Django 2.2+. The file context and search results point to `django/db/models/base.py`, which contains the base model class definition. Notably, the `Model.__init__` span is particularly relevant as it deals with the initialization of model instances, which could be where the override might require adjustments. The provided search results do not yield specific spans detailing the `get_FIELD_display` function itself or its handling in Django 2.2+, suggesting that the investigation might need to continue to locate more specific sections of code. The search is not complete until we find details about how `get_FIELD_display` is handled or why it cannot be overridden in Django 2.2+. However, the provided context suggests that the issue lies in the model initialization or handling of model fields, prompting a deeper investigation into related code in the Django source.",
