To understand and potentially resolve this issue, we need to look into the implementation of `get_FIELD_display` in Django 2.2 and how it has changed compared to previous versions. We should also explore model and field definitions to see if there are any alterations affecting this function's ability to be overridden. Given the context, focusing on files within Django's `db/models` and `db/models/fields` directories might yield essential insights.",

This method is used to get the human-readable version of a field's value when it has choices. The issue suggests that this functionality worked in Django 2.1 but has changed in 2.2. I will focus my analysis on the code related to this method in the `Model` class and its interactions with fields. The provided `django/db/models/base.py` file contains a method `_get_FIELD_display` which is likely relevant to this issue, as it directly handles the display of field values based on their choices. Other parts of the code in the search results relate to the initialization and deletion of model objects, which are not directly relevant to the reported issue. However, the `_get_FIELD_display` method is critical as it correlates with the user's inability to override this functionality. Additionally, the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file contains definitions for various field types, including their choices and how they are handled, which could indirectly affect the `get_FIELD_display` functionality. For now, I will identify the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class as the most relevant code span.",

This design change is intentional, and there doesn't appear to be a straightforward way to modify the existing code to support this use case without potentially breaking other functionalities.
