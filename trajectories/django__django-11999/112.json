The example provided shows a model `FooBar` with a custom `get_foo_bar_display` method that is intended to override the default behavior of `get_foo_bar_display` provided by Django. Upon analyzing the search results, I have identified several relevant code spans that are likely related to the issue at hand. Specifically, these code spans involve the `Model` class initialization and the `Options` class in Django's `base` and `options` modules, which handle model metadata and initialization respectively. Furthermore, the `Field` class initialization and various field types from the `fields` module are also relevant as they define the behavior of fields within a Django model, including how they are displayed. These code spans provide a deeper understanding of how Django handles model creation and field definitions, which is crucial for developing a solution to the reported issue. However, the search results do not directly contain the implementation of `get_FIELD_display`, suggesting that further investigation is needed to find the exact code responsible for this functionality and to understand why overriding it might not be working as expected in Django 2.2+. It's also important to note that while these code spans are relevant, they do not cover every aspect of the issue. For instance, there might be additional code in other parts of the Django codebase that are responsible for handling the `get_FIELD_display` method in Django 2.2+.",
