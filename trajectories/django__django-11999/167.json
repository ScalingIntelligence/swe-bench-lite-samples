The issue specifies that this function works in Django 2.1 but not in later versions. The user provides an example of attempting to override this function in a model, but it fails to do so in Django 2.2. Upon reviewing the search results, it is crucial to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the get_FIELD_display functionality and how it is handled in Django 2.2+. The search results provided include sections from two files, 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', there is a span labeled 'Model._get_FIELD_display', which directly addresses the method in question. This span contains the implementation of the _get_FIELD_display function. Given the direct relevance of this span to the reported issue, it should be included in the identified spans. Additionally, for a more comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to include the 'Model' class definition and its '__init__' method for context, as these sections might also indirectly influence how the get_FIELD_display method behaves or can be overridden. In 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', the 'Field' class and its related methods, such as 'get_attname' and 'get_choices', might influence how fields are handled and displayed by the get_FIELD_display method, although more indirectly. These spans could be relevant for understanding the context in which the get_FIELD_display method operates.
