The search results provide insights into the Model and Field classes from Django's db.models module, which are crucial for understanding how Django handles model field display and possibly how the override functionality has changed or is restricted in newer versions.\n\nIn the search results, the Model class initializer (__init__) is found, which is essential for understanding how Django models are instantiated and how fields are processed. Additionally, the Field class and its methods, such as __init__, get_attname, get_internal_type, and others, are relevant for understanding how fields are defined and managed within Django models. These sections of code are likely where changes or restrictions in functionality could have been introduced.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided search results, the identified spans include the Model class's __init__ method and the Field class with its relevant methods.
