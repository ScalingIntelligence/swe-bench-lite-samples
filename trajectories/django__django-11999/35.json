This method is typically used to get the human-readable version of a field's value when the field is using the `choices` option. The example provided shows a custom implementation of `get_foo_bar_display()` in a `FooBar` model, which is not functioning as expected in Django 2.2+. To address this issue, it's necessary to identify the relevant code spans in Django's source that deal with the `get_FIELD_display()` method and model field initialization.\n\nFrom the search results, two files are particularly relevant: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The first file contains the definition of the `Model` class and its initialization method, which is critical for understanding how model instances are created and how fields are handled. The second file contains the definition of various field types, including `CharField`, which is used in the example provided. Specifically, the `Field` class and its initialization method are of interest as they set up the behavior of model fields.\n\nKey code spans to focus on include the initialization of the `Model` class (`Model.__init__`) and the definition of field types in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. These code spans provide context on how fields are set up and how their human-readable values are accessed. The `choices` attribute for fields and the `get_FIELD_display()` method's implementation are crucial aspects to consider within these spans.\n\nGiven the detailed context provided in the search results, it's evident that these code spans are pertinent to the reported issue. They offer insights into how Django models and fields are initialized and how the `get_FIELD_display()` method might be affected by changes in Django 2.2+.",

To address this issue, a more strategic approach might be necessary, such as examining more generic functionalities related to field display or localization that could indirectly influence how `get_FIELD_display` operates. Additionally, since the issue pertains to version 2.2+, a comparative analysis with Django 2.1 could be insightful. Looking into the release notes or changelogs for Django 2.2 might pinpoint changes that affected the `get_FIELD_display` method. Furthermore, inspecting the Django tests directory could reveal how the method is intended to be used or how it behaves under different conditions, providing clues on where its implementation lies.",

Additionally, considering the history of changes between Django 2.1 and 2.2, we'll refine our approach to exclude or adjust attempts to locate the exact implementation if it is deeply embedded in a way that standard searching tactics cannot uncover it.",
