This function is used to get the human-readable value of a field with choices. The issue suggests that the behavior has changed in Django 2.2, affecting the ability to customize this function.\n\nThe search results provided include two files from the Django codebase: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. These files contain classes and methods that are relevant to model field handling and model instance initialization.\n\nIn `django/db/models/base.py`, there is the `Model` class with its `__init__` method, which is responsible for initializing instances of model classes. This is relevant as it deals with the instantiation of model objects, which could be related to how field values, including choices, are handled.\n\nIn `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, there are various field classes defined, such as `BooleanField`, `CharField`, `DateField`, etc., along with their initialization methods. These classes manage the behavior of different types of fields within Django models, including how choices are managed.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue (overriding `get_FIELD_display`), the relevant code spans would be those that deal with field initialization and management, particularly in how they handle choices. The `Model.__init__` span in `django/db/models/base.py` and the initialization of various field classes in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` are the most relevant spans that could help in understanding and potentially addressing the issue.\n\nThese spans provide critical context for how model instances are created and how field values are set, which is directly related to the functionality the user wishes to override.",

While the `Model` class contains initialization and field handling logic, it does not directly show the implementation or method for `get_FOO_display()`.
