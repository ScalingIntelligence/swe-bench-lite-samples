This suggests that the functionality or behavior of this method has changed between Django 2.1 and 2.2. The search results include the 'django/db/models/base.py' file, which is likely to contain the implementation of the Model class and its methods. The 'Model' class and its '__init__' method are particularly relevant, as they may include the logic for handling field displays and could potentially explain why the function cannot be overridden in Django 2.2+. The 'get_foo_bar_display()' method in the user's example is expected to be overridden to return a specific value, but it doesn't work as intended in Django 2.2+. Given the complexity and encapsulation of Django's internal workings, examining the '__init__' method in the 'Model' class provides insight into how Django handles field values and could explain the change in behavior from version 2.1 to 2.2.",

The example provided shows a class FooBar with a method get_foo_bar_display that the user expects to override but doesn't in Django 2.2+. \n\nStep 2: Review the current file context. The provided context is from django/db/models/base.py and includes several spans of code where the Model class and its methods are defined. This context does not directly address the issue of overriding get_FIELD_display.\n\nStep 3: Process new search results.\n3.1. Analyze each code span in the search results. The search results include multiple files, notably django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/fields/__init__.py.\n3.2. Match code spans with the key elements. The most relevant span is `Model._get_FIELD_display` from django/db/models/base.py, which directly relates to the method the user wants to override.\n3.3. Evaluate relevance. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method appears to be internal implementation Django uses to get display values for fields. This is highly relevant to the user's issue.\n3.4. Review entire sections of code to ensure completeness. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method and its surrounding code in the base.py file give a complete picture of how Django internally handles field display values.\n3.5. Verify references to other parts of the codebase. There are no additional references in the given spans that suggest further relevant code outside these search results.\n\nStep 4: Return relevant code spans. Identified the relevant span `Model._get_FIELD_display` which is crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of field display methods in Django models.",
