The issue seems to be related to how Django handles field display methods in the Model class and the underlying Field class. The current file context provides some insights into the ModelBase class and the Model class from Django's internals, which are likely relevant since they deal with model creation and instance initialization.\n\nIn the search results, there are three files that are potentially relevant:\n1. django/contrib/admin/utils.py - This file contains utility functions used in the Django admin. Although it does not directly address the reported issue, it may contain helpful functions for displaying field values.\n2. django/db/models/base.py - This file contains fundamental classes like Model and ModelBase, which are likely related to the way Django handles model instances and field access.\n3. django/db/models/fields/__init__.py - This file contains definitions for various Field types and the base Field class itself. Understanding how fields are defined and managed might be crucial for resolving the reported issue.\n\nGiven these insights, the most relevant files seem to be django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/fields/__init__.py. The spans within these files that are most relevant to the reported issue include implementations of the Model and Field classes, particularly those dealing with field initialization and the handling of default and overridden methods. The span Model.__init__ in django/db/models/base.py is particularly noteworthy as it covers the initialization process for model instances, which is relevant to understanding how field methods might be affected by upgrades.

To accurately pinpoint the changes that might affect the ability to override this method, we should focus on reviewing the release notes for Django 2.2. These notes may detail any changes or deprecations related to model field handling, method overriding, or Django's internal mechanisms impacting this functionality. Additionally, examining the commit history or issue tracker discussions on Django's GitHub repository for mentions of `get_FIELD_display()`, changes in method resolution, or updates affecting model methods could provide deeper insight into the nature of this issue.",
