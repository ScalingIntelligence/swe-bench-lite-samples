The example provided shows a custom method 'get_foo_bar_display' in a model class 'FooBar'. The expected behavior is overridden functionality, which worked in Django 2.1 but not in 2.2. To resolve this issue, it's necessary to investigate how Django handles the 'get_FIELD_display' method in version 2.2, focusing on the Model class and related field classes where this functionality is usually defined. I will search for changes in the way this function is implemented or handled in Django 2.2 that might affect the ability to override it. Specifically, I will look into the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' and the 'Field' class in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', as well as any related classes that might be involved in handling field display methods.",

This is relevant because the Model class is where methods like get_FIELD_display would be defined or overridden.\n\nGiven the issue, it's clear that the focus is on understanding how the get_FIELD_display method works and how it might be overridden in Django 2.2. The provided code snippets include the Model initialization, which could be relevant if the method overrides in the user's model class are not being applied correctly during initialization. However, we don't see the specific implementation of get_FIELD_display in the provided code, which might be in another part of the Django codebase or might be inherited from a base class not shown here.\n\nDespite not having the exact code span for the get_FIELD_display method, the search results are relevant because they provide context on how Model instances are initialized and how fields are set, which could be related to the issue of overriding the display method. Further investigation would be needed to find the specific implementation of get_FIELD_display or any related changes in Django 2.2 that might affect method overriding behavior.\n\nBased on the relevance of the provided code spans to the reported issue, I can conclude that the provided search results offer valuable context but do not fully resolve the issue due to the absence of the specific method in question.",
