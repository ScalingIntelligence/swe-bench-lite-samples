The example provided shows an attempt to override the method in a custom model. To identify relevant code spans, I focused on the `Model` class within `django/db/models/base.py` as it is responsible for defining the behavior of models. I had to ensure that I understood how the `get_FIELD_display` method might be handled or affected within this class, even though it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the spans provided. Additionally, the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is critical because it defines the behavior of individual fields, which are used to build models. Specifically, spans related to field initialization and handling were crucial. I also reviewed the `django/forms/fields.py` for potential implications and found instances of `Field` and its subclasses that might correlate with the issue. \n\nAfter reviewing the spans, particularly in `django/db/models/base.py`, it was clear that the `__init__` method of the `Model` class played a key role in how model instances are created and managed, potentially impacting any overridden methods like `get_foo_bar_display`. The `Field.__init__` in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` was also relevant as it handles field-specific configurations that could affect method behavior. While no direct mention of `get_FIELD_display` was found, understanding how Django initializes and handles models and their fields was crucial. Consequently, I selected spans from these two files as they are foundational for the issue's context within Django's model architecture.",

We know from the file context provided that the `Model` class does not explicitly define `get_FIELD_display`, which implies it might be dynamically generated or inherited. Django's dynamic nature often implies that methods like `get_FIELD_display` might be part of a metaclass or base class that models inherit from. Additionally, the `Field` class, particularly its `choices` attribute, plays a crucial role in how `get_FIELD_display` operates, as it handles the mapping of field values to their human-readable counterparts. To fully understand the behavior changes in Django 2.2, especially regarding this method's overrideability, a careful examination of related metaclasses, base classes, internal method implementations, and potential changes introduced in Django 2.2 would be necessary.",
