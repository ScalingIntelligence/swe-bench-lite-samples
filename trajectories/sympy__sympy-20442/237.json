The problem seems to stem from the way `convert_to` is implemented and how it manages unit conversions. Given the file context, it's clear that the `convert_to` function is spread across multiple files in the `sympy/physics/units` directory. To narrow down the exact code causing the issue, we should focus on the files mentioning `convert_to` and look for code patterns that could lead to improper handling of orthogonal units, such as `joule` and `second`. Specifically, the `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, and `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` files are critical as they directly involve unit handling and conversion methods.",

The specific example provided is the conversion of `J*s` (joule-second) to joule, which yields an unexpected result (`joule**(7/9)`). This suggests that the function may not be correctly handling the conversion of units when they are orthogonal (i.e., not convertible to each other directly). Given this, the analysis focuses on identifying the relevant code spans that deal with the `convert_to` function and its underlying mechanisms, particularly the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` which is used to determine the conversion matrix. Additionally, it's important to review the `Quantity` class which is fundamental in handling units and quantities. The search results provided include implementations of the `convert_to` function, the `Quantity` class, and related methods and utilities. These spans are directly relevant to the issue reported as they involve the core logic behind unit conversions in the system.",

The user provided examples show unexpected results when converting Joules multiplied by seconds to Joules, expecting either the unchanged expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. The primary focus of the analysis is to ensure that the `convert_to` function behaves as expected in such scenarios.\n\nReviewing the current file context, it's clear that the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` is central to the issue, along with the `Quantity` class and its `convert_to` method in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`. These sections already contain the core logic for unit conversion.\n\nIn the new search results, the same code spans for `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` and `convert_to` are present, confirming that the central logic for unit conversion has not changed. The `convert_to` function processes an expression and attempts to convert it to the target units using a conversion matrix. The function also handles scale factors appropriately.\n\nGiven this, I can conclude that the provided code spans in both the file context and search results are sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue regarding the `convert_to` function's handling of orthogonal units.",

Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
