Specifically, the user observed unexpected results when attempting to convert 'joule*second' to 'joule', resulting in an incorrect expression 'joule**(7/9)'. The expectation was either the unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. The 'convert_to' function should ideally handle such conversions correctly. The provided search results contain the 'convert_to' function implementation along with a supporting function '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr'. These functions are directly related to the conversion of units and thus highly relevant to the issue. Analyzing the code, it is evident that the function first checks if the target units are iterable and then processes the expression to convert it. The function also handles different types of expressions and calculates the scale factor for the conversion. To diagnose and potentially fix the issue, one would need to focus on these functions to ensure that the conversion logic accurately handles the combination of different units. The code spans identified as relevant are those containing the implementation of 'convert_to' and '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr'.",
