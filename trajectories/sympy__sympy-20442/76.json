It's likely that the function `convert_to` in the `util.py` file is responsible for handling these conversions.

The provided example shows unexpected results when converting `joule*second` to `joule`. The key part of the issue is the odd behavior of the `convert_to` function, which does not handle orthogonal units as expected. The search results include two relevant code spans from the file `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. The `convert_to` function is directly related to the issue as it is responsible for unit conversion. Additionally, the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function is used within `convert_to` and appears to be responsible for generating a conversion matrix which is crucial for handling the conversion logic. These two functions are the most relevant for addressing the issue reported. Therefore, the identified spans are `convert_to` and `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`.",
