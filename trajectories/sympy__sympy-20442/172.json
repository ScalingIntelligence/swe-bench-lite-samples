The user provides examples where the behavior is unexpected, suggesting that the function should either return the original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or raise an error. The key elements in the reported issue are the function `convert_to`, the unexpected results it produces, and the scenario where `J = kg*m**2/s**2` is converted to `J*s = kg*m**2/s`. From the search results, we find two files containing relevant code: 'sympy/physics/units/util.py' and 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py'. In 'util.py', the `convert_to` function is defined and contains the logic for converting expressions to target units, including handling of scale factors and dimensional matrices. The function `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` is also relevant as it computes the conversion matrix needed for the conversion process. In 'quantities.py', the `Quantity` class is defined with a `convert_to` method that utilizes the `convert_to` function from 'util.py'. This context helps in identifying that the code spans related to `convert_to` in both files are directly relevant to the reported issue.",
