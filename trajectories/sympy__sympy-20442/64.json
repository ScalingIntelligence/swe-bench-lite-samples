            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the `convert_to` function in the `sympy` library when converting quantities with orthogonal units. The example provided shows unexpected results when converting `joule*second` to `joule`, yielding `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged expression or an error. This suggests a potential bug or inconsistency in how the function handles such conversions. Reviewing the code spans provided, we focus on the `Quantity` class and the `convert_to` method within it. This method delegates the conversion to the `convert_to` function in the `util` module, which is where the logic for conversion resides. The `convert_to` function in `util.py` checks the dimensional compatibility and calculates the scale factor for conversion. It uses the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function to determine if a conversion is possible. Based on the issue description, it seems likely that the error lies in how the scale factor or conversion matrix is calculated, particularly when handling expressions involving multiples of units. Thus, the relevant code spans include the `convert_to` method in the `Quantity` class and the `convert_to` function in the `util` module, as well as the helper function `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, which is crucial for determining the feasibility and parameters of the conversions.",
