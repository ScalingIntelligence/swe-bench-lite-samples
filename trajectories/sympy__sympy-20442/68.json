The user expects the original expression or conversion to base units, but receives an unexpected result. Upon examining the provided code spans, the following observations were made:\n\n1. The `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` is central to the issue. It attempts to convert the expression to the target units using a conversion matrix obtained from `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`. This function handles various cases such as expressions being instances of `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, or `Quantity`.\n\n2. The `Quantity.convert_to` method in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` directly calls the `convert_to` function from `util.py`, suggesting that any issues with the conversion logic would stem from the implementation in `util.py`.\n\n3. The `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function is responsible for determining if a conversion is possible based on dimensional dependencies. It appears that the logic here might not handle combinations of units correctly, especially those that are orthogonal in nature (like `joule` and `second`).\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans appear to be the full implementation of the `convert_to` function in `util.py` and the `Quantity.convert_to` method in `quantities.py`, as they directly deal with the conversion logic and the API used to invoke this logic.",
