The user expects certain behaviors that are not observed, such as the function not returning the original expression or transforming the units in unexpected ways. The main focus of the issue is the conversion logic within the `convert_to` function and how it handles different unit expressions. In the provided search results, the `convert_to` function definition is found in the file `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. Moreover, the `Quantity` class in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` has a method `convert_to` which delegates to the utility function. These are directly related to the functionality under scrutiny in the reported issue. Specifically, I identified the following relevant code spans:\n1. In `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, the `convert_to` function definition describes how the conversion is attempted, including checks for instance types, calculation of scale factors, and application of conversion matrices.\n2. In `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, the `Quantity.convert_to` method is a proxy to the utility function, handling the conversion of a `Quantity` instance to another unit system or target unit. Given the direct relevance and the fact that these code spans cover the core functionality of the `convert_to` feature as discussed in the issue, it is determined that these are the relevant spans to address the reported issue.\n",
