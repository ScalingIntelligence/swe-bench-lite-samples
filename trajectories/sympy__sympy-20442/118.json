Specifically, it appears to handle certain unit combinations incorrectly, such as `joule * second` to `joule`, producing `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected original expression or an error. Given the files already identified as potentially relevant, I will focus the search on methods and functions directly related to unit conversion, particularly the `convert_to` method in the `Quantity` class and any utility functions that might assist or interact with this method. I will also look into the `UnitSystem` class and its interactions as it plays a crucial role in unit handling.

The user expects certain outcomes from the method, and the method does not meet these expectations. To address this, we need to look at the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with unit conversions. From the search results, we can see that the 'convert_to' method is defined in the 'Quantity' class in 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py', and it calls a more generic 'convert_to' function from the 'util' module. Additionally, the 'UnitSystem' class in 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py' is relevant, as it contains methods for handling dimensional expressions and collecting factors and dimensions. One likely area of concern is the implementation of unit conversions, which might not correctly handle orthogonal units. The relevant code spans to investigate further include the 'convert_to' method in the 'Quantity' class, the 'get_dimensional_expr' method in the 'UnitSystem' class, and the '_collect_factor_and_dimension' method in the 'UnitSystem' class.",

Therefore, the code snippet provided in the file_context from `sympy/physics/units/util.py` confirms the actual implementation of the `convert_to` function used for unit conversions in SymPy's `Quantity` class.
