This suggests a problem in how units are being combined or simplified. From the provided context, relevant files include 'sympy/physics/units/util.py', 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py', and 'sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py'. These files should be checked for implementations of 'convert_to' and related methods such as 'quantity_simplify' and 'check_dimensions', which might be involved in unit conversion or simplification. Additionally, 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' contains the 'powsimp' function, which might be used in the simplification process and could be relevant depending on how the units are handled mathematically. Given the existing context, it seems appropriate to focus the search on these files and potentially broaden it by considering the broader 'sympy/physics/units' module as a whole, looking for any functions or classes dealing with unit conversion or simplification.",

Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
