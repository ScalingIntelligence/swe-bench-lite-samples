The function should ideally return the unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. Relevant files that might contain the `convert_to` function have been identified in the `sympy/physics/units` directory. To refine the search, I will focus on these files, especially `util.py`, `quantities.py`, and `unitsystem.py`, as these are likely to contain the relevant implementation of `convert_to`.",

The issue describes unexpected results when attempting to convert units that are orthogonal, such as joule (energy) and second (time), which should not be directly convertible without an explicit relationship defined. This suggests that the 'convert_to' function may be incorrectly determining the conversion factor or handling the units. The relevant code spans from 'sympy/physics/units/util.py' and 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py' are particularly interesting as they contain the implementation of 'convert_to' and the 'Quantity' class, which interacts with the unit conversion process. By examining these code spans, we can understand how the conversion process is handled and potentially identify where the logic might fail for orthogonal units. These code spans are thus identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
