            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the `convert_to` function in SymPy, particularly when handling expressions that combine orthogonal units. The example provided shows an unexpected result when converting `joule * second` to `joule`, yielding `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. This suggests a potential bug or misunderstanding in how `convert_to` processes unit conversions.\n\nGiven the search results, two main files and corresponding code spans are identified as relevant: \n1. `sympy/physics/units/util.py` contains the implementation of the `convert_to` function and the helper function `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, which are central to the unit conversion logic.\n2. `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` contains the `Quantity` class, which includes a method `convert_to` that internally calls the `convert_to` function from `util.py`. This linkage shows how the `Quantity` class interacts with the conversion logic.\n\nThese code spans are identified as relevant because they directly address the functionality under question: the `convert_to` function's handling of unit conversions. The issue seems to be with how the function calculates or applies conversion factors, possibly in the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function. Reviewing these code spans should help in understanding and potentially fixing the issue reported.",

Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
