The unexpected result when converting `joule*second` to `joule` suggests that the function may not handle certain unit conversion cases as expected. Potential areas of focus include the implementation of the `convert_to` method within the `Quantity` class and the `util.py` file, which contains the `convert_to` function. Additionally, examining the `UnitSystem` class and its related methods in `unitsystem.py` may provide insight into how units are managed and converted. To delve deeper, I'll search for specific occurrences of the `convert_to` function within these relevant files.",

The main concern is that the function returns an odd result instead of retaining the original expression or converting to base units. To address this, we need to analyze the `convert_to` function and related code spans in the provided search results.\n\n1. **sympy/physics/units/util.py**\n   - The `convert_to` function definition is found here, which is central to the issue reported. This function handles the conversion logic and seems to be where the problem might lie.\n   - The `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function is also found in the same file, which is utilized within `convert_to`, suggesting it plays a role in handling the conversion matrix and could be related to the issue.\n\n2. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py**\n   - The `Quantity` class and its `convert_to` method are found here. This suggests that the `convert_to` function from `util.py` is indirectly called through the `Quantity` class, reinforcing the focus on the `convert_to` function in `util.py`.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue, as they contain the implementation and related utilities for the `convert_to` function. By examining these spans, we can better understand the circumstances under which the function fails to meet expectations and possibly identify improvements or fixes.",
