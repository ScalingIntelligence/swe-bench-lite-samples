The example provided shows that converting `joule*second` to `joule` results in an unexpected output `joule**(7/9)`, whereas the expected outcome would be either the unchanged original expression, a conversion in terms of base units, or an error.\n\nThe search results contain two key code spans: one for the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function and another for the `convert_to` function. These functions are central to the unit conversion process in SymPy. The `convert_to` function is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the conversion of an expression into specified units. It uses the conversion matrix obtained from `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to perform the conversion, which is indicative of how the system handles mismatched units.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the `convert_to` function needs to be examined more closely to determine how it processes cases where the units being converted are not directly compatible. The presence of the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function also suggests that this may play a role in identifying and handling such scenarios. By analyzing these code spans, we can begin to understand how SymPy handles unit conversions and identify areas for potential enhancement or correction based on the user's expectations.",
