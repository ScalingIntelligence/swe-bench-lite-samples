Specifically, the user is trying to convert `J*s` (joule*second) to joule and is getting an unexpected result `joule**(7/9)`. The expected behavior, presumably, is either returning the unchanged expression or converting it to an expression in terms of base units or raising an error for invalid conversion. Analyzing the provided code snippets, I see two key functions: `convert_to` in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `convert_to` in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. The former calls the latter, which in turn uses `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to determine the conversion. It appears that the discrepancy in the output might arise from how `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` and `convert_to` handle the conversion logic, particularly how it assesses the suitability of the conversion and computes the scale factors. The snippets include the relevant classes and functions necessary to investigate and possibly correct the anomalous behavior noted in the issue.

The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
