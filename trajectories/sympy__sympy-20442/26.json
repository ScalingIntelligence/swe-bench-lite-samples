The user provides examples illustrating unexpected results and expects either the original expression, an expression in base units, or an error. The search results encompass two main files: 'sympy/physics/units/util.py' and 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py'. In 'util.py', the `convert_to` function is defined, handling the conversion of expressions to target units. It uses helper functions like `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to determine if conversion is possible. The 'quantities.py' file defines the `Quantity` class, which includes a method `convert_to` that delegates to the `convert_to` function in 'util.py'. Both files are relevant because 'util.py' contains the core logic for conversion, while 'quantities.py' is the interface through which users typically interact with the functionality. It is crucial to closely examine the logic in 'util.py' to understand why the conversions are not behaving as expected.",
