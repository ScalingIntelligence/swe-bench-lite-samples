            "scratch_pad": "After reviewing the provided file context, it's clear that the 'convert_to' function is central to the unit conversion process in SymPy. The issue seems to be rooted in the way the '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr' function handles the dimensional analysis required for unit conversion. Specifically, the logic that determines whether the conversion is possible and computes the necessary scale factors might be insufficient or incorrect for certain expressions, such as 'joule*second' to 'joule'. To address this, further investigation into how the dimension system and scale factors are managed within these functions is essential. Additionally, the 'get_total_scale_factor' method, used to retrieve the scale factor of the expression, could also be a point of interest. Therefore, further searches should focus on the '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr' and 'get_total_scale_factor' functions, as well as their interactions within the unit conversion process.",

  "initial_message": "convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\r\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
