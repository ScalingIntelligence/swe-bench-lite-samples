The provided search results include the relevant function `convert_to` and a supporting function `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` within `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. Additionally, the `Quantity` class and its `convert_to` method in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` are relevant as they directly interact with the `convert_to` function from `util.py`. These functions and methods are central to the unit conversion process described in the issue. By analyzing these functions, we can understand the logic and potential flaws in handling unit conversions, which aligns with the reported issue. Furthermore, the issue suggests that the `convert_to` function might not handle all conversion scenarios appropriately, particularly those involving orthogonal units.
