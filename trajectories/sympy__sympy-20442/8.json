The user is encountering unexpected results, specifically when trying to convert `joule*second` to `joule`, which results in `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. To address this, it's crucial to analyze the `convert_to` function and its related components as they appear in the search results. The `convert_to` function is defined within the `Quantity` class in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, and its implementation calls the `convert_to` function from `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. This implementation involves the use of a conversion matrix and scale factors to perform the unit conversion. The relevance of these spans is confirmed by their direct relation to the `convert_to` functionality described in the issue. Therefore, these spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
