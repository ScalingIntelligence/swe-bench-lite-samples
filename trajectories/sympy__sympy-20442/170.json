            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the behavior of the `convert_to` function in the `sympy.physics.units` module. The user's expectations clash with the observed behavior\u2014specifically, they expect the function to either return the original expression unchanged, convert to base units, or raise an error. Instead, the function attempts to combine orthogonal units in a way they find surprising, exemplified by the expression `joule**(7/9)` upon converting `joule*second` to `joule`. This indicates a potential oversight or flaw in how the `convert_to` function handles unit conversion when the units are multiply linked and combines different units. Given this, it is crucial to examine the `convert_to` function and any associated helper functions to understand how they process and attempt to simplify or transform units during conversion. From the provided search results, key elements identified that could be responsible for the issue are the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` and the corresponding `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function. Both of these are involved in the conversion process and checking dimensional compatibility, which is directly related to the reported issue. Detailed inspection reveals the mechanism used to get the conversion matrix and the scale factor, suggesting this code segment might be where the misunderstanding or misuse of units occurs. Therefore, the identified spans are directly relevant to diagnosing the issue and necessary for addressing the user's concern about the unexpected outcome of the function.",

The code analysis should focus around the `convert_to` method, `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function, and related utility functions like `get_total_scale_factor` and dimension systems. From the context provided, the files `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py` have already been identified as containing relevant code. Additional search results have been provided in files such as `sympy/physics/units/definitions/__init__.py`, `sympy/physics/units/systems/length_weight_time.py`, and others which might contain definitions of units like `joule`, `second`, etc., and their associated dimensions that could influence the `convert_to` method's behavior. Given the complexity of the `convert_to` operation which likely involves dimensional analysis, matrix operations, and scale factor calculations, reviewing and understanding the dimensional dependencies and scale factors in these files may be crucial to resolving the reported issue. The code analysis will be conducted keeping these aspects in mind to identify if the provided search results are relevant to the reported issue. The identified spans will focus on the sections related to the `convert_to` method and any other related functions or definitions that could be implicated in the unexpected behavior.",

The `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function within the `util` module is the core function for determining the conversion matrix, which is crucial for handling unit conversions. The current implementation directly handles the type of conversion discussed in the issue. Specifically, the function evaluates the dimensional consistency of the expression and the target units, and then computes the conversion matrix if possible. If the dimensions are not consistent or the matrix cannot be computed, the original expression is returned. The `convert_to` function handles various types of expressions, including those with additive and multiplicative forms, ensuring that each part of the expression is converted appropriately.
