The user provided examples showing unexpected results from `convert_to`, specifically when converting `joule*second` to `joule`. The expected behavior would be the unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error, but the function returns `joule**(7/9)`. This suggests that the `convert_to` function is not handling mixed units correctly. In the search results, the `Quantity` class and its `convert_to` method are identified, which calls the `convert_to` function in the `util.py` module. Additionally, the `util.py` module contains the `convert_to` function and related helper functions like `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` which are likely involved in the unit conversion process. These functions and methods are directly relevant to the issue as they are responsible for handling unit conversions within the sympy.physics.units module.

  "initial_message": "convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\r\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
