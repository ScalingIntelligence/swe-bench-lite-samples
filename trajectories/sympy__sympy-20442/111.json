This behavior is demonstrated by the code snippet `convert_to(joule*second,joule)` producing `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged original expression. Given the provided file context, the relevant files already identified are mostly located in the `sympy/physics/units` directory. The primary focus should be on the `util.py`, `quantities.py`, and `unitsystem.py` files within this directory, as they contain classes and functions related to unit conversion. Specifically, looking for the `convert_to` function and its implementation across these files will be the most relevant for debugging and solving the issue.",

The user expects certain outcomes or behaviors from the `convert_to` function, but the actual results do not meet these expectations. To address this issue, it is crucial to identify the code spans that directly relate to the `convert_to` function and the underlying logic for unit conversion. This involves understanding how the function processes expressions and handles unit conversions. The `Quantity` class and its `convert_to` method in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` are relevant, as they define the behavior of the `convert_to` function. Additionally, the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` is central to the conversion logic, particularly the handling of scale factors and conversion matrices. These code spans are likely to contain the logic that fails to meet the user's expectations and need to be reviewed and potentially modified to correct the behavior. Identifying these spans helps in pinpointing where the issue might lie and allows for targeted debugging and modifications.",
