This suggests that the `convert_to` function might not handle cases where the units are orthogonal as expected.\n\nFrom the search results, two key files are identified: `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. These files contain the `Quantity` class and the `convert_to` method within the `Quantity` class, as well as the `convert_to` function and related helper functions in the `util.py` file.\n\nThe `Quantity.convert_to` method essentially delegates the conversion process to the `convert_to` function in `util.py`. This function handles the conversion by first ensuring the target units are iterable, then handling expressions of type `Add` and `Quantity`. It also includes a `get_total_scale_factor` function to calculate the scale factor of the expression. The core of the conversion logic appears to be in the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function, which determines if a conversion matrix can be generated based on the dimensions of the expression and target units. If no valid matrix is found, the original expression is returned.\n\nGiven the issue description, the relevant code spans appear to be those related to the `convert_to` function and its helper functions, as they directly deal with the unit conversion process and could be where the unexpected result is arising.",
