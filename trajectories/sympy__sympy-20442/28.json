The example provided shows an unexpected result when converting `joule*second` to `joule`. This suggests an issue with how the function handles certain unit conversions.\n\nReviewing the search results, the `convert_to` function is defined in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` and is used within the `Quantity` class in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`. The `convert_to` function itself handles the conversion logic, including checks for the type of the target units and recursive calls for handling expressions involving addition. It also calls `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to determine if the conversion is possible based on dimensional analysis.\n\nThe issue described seems to be related to how the conversion matrix is computed or applied, specifically in cases where the units are not directly compatible but should ideally result in an unchanged expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans are those related to the `convert_to` function and its auxiliary functions like `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`.",

The user provides examples where the function does not return the expected results, such as converting joule*second to joule which results in an unexpected expression. The analysis of the code shows that the `convert_to` function is responsible for converting expressions to target units within a specified unit system. The function uses `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to determine the conversion matrix and then applies this to the expression. The current file context includes the `convert_to` function and the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function, which are both relevant to addressing the issue. The search results repeat the same context, confirming the relevance of these functions to the reported issue.

The function is expected to handle such cases more gracefully, possibly returning an unchanged expression or an error, but it currently returns unexpected results. The implementation of convert_to relies on _get_conversion_matrix_for_expr, and the issue reported with joule and second as orthogonal units is directly related to the limitations seen in _get_conversion_matrix_for_expr.
