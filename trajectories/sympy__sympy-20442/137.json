The user expects the function to return the unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error when dealing with orthogonal units. The provided search results contain two main files: 'sympy/physics/units/util.py' and 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py'. In 'util.py', there are two significant code spans: '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr' and 'convert_to'. These functions are central to the conversion process and directly relate to the issue reported. The 'convert_to' function in 'util.py' is responsible for converting the expression to the target units and contains the logic for handling different types of expressions, such as Add and Mul. It also includes a call to '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr', suggesting this function is crucial for determining the possible conversions. In 'quantities.py', the 'Quantity' class contains a method 'convert_to' that internally calls the 'convert_to' function from 'util.py'. This method is likely used when directly calling 'convert_to' on a quantity object. Both files and their relevant spans seem crucial to address the reported issue, as they involve the core functionality of unit conversion in SymPy.",
