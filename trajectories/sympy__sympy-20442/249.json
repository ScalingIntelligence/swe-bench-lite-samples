The current context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet. Upon reviewing the search results, it's evident that the 'convert_to' method is defined within the 'Quantity' class in the 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py' file. This method internally calls another 'convert_to' function from the 'util' module. This definition directly relates to the issue at hand since the unexpected behavior described ('convert_to' combining orthogonal units) is precisely what the method is supposed to handle. As such, the method definition itself and the call to the utility function are highly relevant to addressing the issue. Therefore, I have identified the 'Quantity.convert_to' span as relevant.",
