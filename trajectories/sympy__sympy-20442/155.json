This behavior can be observed in the provided example where converting `joule*second` to `joule` results in `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged expression, expression in base units, or an error. The relevant parts of the codebase are those that handle the conversion logic in the `convert_to` function and its associated helper functions. From the search results, the `Quantity` class in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` contains the `convert_to` method which calls the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. This util function, among other things, uses `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to determine the conversion matrix for the expression and target units. The `convert_to` function in `util.py` also includes logic to handle different types of expressions, calculate scale factors, and apply the conversion matrix. These functions and methods are strongly relevant to the issue as they directly handle the conversion of quantities from one unit to another, which is the main subject of the reported issue.",

The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error.
