The reported issue identifies a problem with the `convert_to` function in SymPy, specifically when converting `joule*second` to `joule`, which yields an unexpected result of `joule**(7/9)` instead of the original expression or an expression in terms of base units. 2. The current file context shows the `convert_to` method within the `Quantity` class, which uses a utility function from `sympy.physics.units.util`. 3. The new search results include the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, which is likely the implementation being used by the `Quantity` class. 4. The `convert_to` function in `util.py` processes the expression to find a conversion matrix and scale factor, potentially where the issue arises. 5. Additional results include files defining unit systems and their relationships, but they do not directly address the issue with `convert_to`. 6. Based on the analysis, the main relevance lies in the `convert_to` function in `util.py`, which directly relates to the bug reported.",
