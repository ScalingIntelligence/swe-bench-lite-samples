Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
