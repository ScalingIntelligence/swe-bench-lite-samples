The problem arises when combining orthogonal units (like joule and second) and attempting to convert them back to the original units. This causes unexpected behavior, yielding results like `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged expression, base units representation, or an error. Examining the relevant files reveals that the `convert_to` function is defined in multiple places within the `sympy/physics/units` directory, including in `util.py`, `quantities.py`, and potentially elsewhere. To comprehensively investigate this issue, it's crucial to focus on the implementations of the `convert_to` function in these files, considering the handling of dimensions and scale factors during conversion. Therefore, the search should target files within the units subdirectory likely containing the `convert_to` function and relevant conversion logic.",

The `util.py` file contains the implementation of `convert_to` and a helper function `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`.\n\nThe relevant code spans are:\n1. The `convert_to` method in the `Quantity` class, which is the entry point for the conversion.\n2. The `convert_to` function in `util.py`, which performs the actual conversion and handles various types of expressions and units.\n3.
