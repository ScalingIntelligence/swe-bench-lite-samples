The provided search results include two key files: `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. In `quantities.py`, the `Quantity` class is found, which includes the `convert_to` method. This method calls the `convert_to` function from `util.py`. The `convert_to` function in `util.py` is the core function responsible for unit conversions. It processes the input expression and target units, and it uses helper functions like `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` to determine if a conversion is possible. Given the issue description, these functions and methods are directly relevant to addressing the reported behavior. Therefore, the identified code spans are likely to be the root of the issue or at least part of the code that needs examination and potential modification to resolve the reported problem.",
