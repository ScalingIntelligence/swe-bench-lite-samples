The problem arises when trying to convert units that should not logically combine, leading to unexpected results like `joule**(7/9)`. The provided files suggest that `convert_to` is implemented in multiple places within the `sympy.physics.units` module, including `util.py` and `quantities.py`. It is crucial to pinpoint how these conversions are handled or mistreated in the context of combining units. Reviewing these specific functions within their respective files should be the priority.",

The issue mentions that the function returns unexpected results, such as 'joule**(7/9)', instead of keeping the original expression unchanged or converting it to base units. To address this, it's essential to locate the implementation of the `convert_to` function and related helper functions to understand how unit conversions are handled. The provided search results include the `Quantity` class in 'quantities.py', which contains a method `convert_to` that redirects to the `convert_to` function in 'util.py'. Additionally, the 'util.py' file includes the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function, which is likely used within `convert_to` to handle the conversion logic. These sections of code are relevant to the issue because they directly involve converting expressions between units, making them key areas to focus on for resolving the reported problem.",
