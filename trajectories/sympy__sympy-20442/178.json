            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the behavior of the `convert_to` function in the SymPy library when handling units that combine orthogonal units. The user provides examples demonstrating unexpected results, such as `convert_to(joule*second,joule)` returning `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected unchanged expression. This suggests that the current implementation of `convert_to` might not adequately handle such conversion scenarios.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, we find two key sections of code:\n1. In `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, there is a class `Quantity` with a method `convert_to` that delegates the conversion to the `convert_to` function in `util.py`.\n2. In `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, the main `convert_to` function is defined, along with `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`. The `convert_to` function's purpose is to convert a given expression to specified target units using a specified unit system. It involves several operations, including checking if the expression can be converted, calculating scale factors, and applying the conversion matrix.\n\nThe `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function appears to be critical for determining if a conversion is possible between the dimensions of the given expression and the target units. If the expression's dimensions are not a subset of the target dimensions, it returns `None`, causing `convert_to` to simply return the original expression. However, it seems there might be a flaw in how the dimensions are handled or in the matrix multiplication logic that leads to the unexpected results observed by the user.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the analysis of the code, the identified relevant code spans appear to be from both `quantities.py` and `util.py`, specifically focusing on the `convert_to` method and the `convert_to` function. These are likely the areas to investigate and potentially fix to address the user's reported issue.",
