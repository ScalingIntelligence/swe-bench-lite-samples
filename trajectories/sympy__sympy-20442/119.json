But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue pertains to the behavior of the 'convert_to' function in sympy, specifically when dealing with orthogonal units. The example provided presents unexpected results when converting a composite unit (joule*second) to a simpler unit (joule). Given the issue description, the key focus is on understanding and potentially modifying the 'convert_to' function to handle such conversions more appropriately, possibly returning the original expression or an error rather than an unexpected result. The search results include exactly the same code spans as those already identified in the file context, specifically focusing on the 'convert_to' function and the '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr' helper function. Since the search results do not introduce any new relevant code and all crucial functions have already been identified, it can be concluded that the task is complete."

  "initial_message": "convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\r\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
