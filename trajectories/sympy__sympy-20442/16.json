The problem arises when converting units that are not directly compatible, leading to unexpected results like `joule**(7/9)` instead of retaining the original expression or converting to base units. Given the file context, it's clear that the `convert_to` function is defined in multiple places across different files within the physics/units module. To ensure a comprehensive search, we should focus on these files, particularly on the `convert_to` function and its related methods for handling unit conversions and expressions. We should also look for any specific handling of 'joule' and 'second' units in these files.",

This suggests that the function might be incorrectly handling unit conversions in certain scenarios involving different dimensions.\n\nIn the provided search results, the `convert_to` function is identified in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, where it processes the expression to be converted and determines if a conversion matrix can be created for the expression based on the target units. The function also handles the extraction of scale factors and applies them to the units during the conversion.\n\nAdditionally, in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, the `Quantity` class has a `convert_to` method that delegates its work to the `convert_to` function in `util.py`. This reinforces the evidence that the reported issue is related to how units are converted within these methods, particularly how dimensions are handled during the conversion process.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans are those within the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py` that handle the main logic of unit conversion, which is likely where the bug affecting orthogonal units would be addressed.",
