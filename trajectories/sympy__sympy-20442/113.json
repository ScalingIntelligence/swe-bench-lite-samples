The issue suggests that the function is combining orthogonal units, leading to unexpected results when converting units. We need to focus on the logic within these functions to understand how unit conversions are being handled.\n\nThe 'convert_to' function in 'sympy/physics/units/util.py' is central to this analysis. It processes the expression and target units, checks dimensional dependencies, and attempts to convert the expression using a conversion matrix. If the conversion matrix is not feasible, it returns the original expression.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Quantity.convert_to' method in 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py' is a wrapper calling the main 'convert_to' function, indicating that this class manages how individual quantities are converted. This is particularly relevant as it directly interacts with the 'convert_to' functionality in the 'util' module.\n\nGiven these details, both code spans are essential to understand the unit conversion process in SymPy and how they might relate to the reported issue of odd behavior when combining orthogonal units.",
