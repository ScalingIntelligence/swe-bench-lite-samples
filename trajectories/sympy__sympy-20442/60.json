Specifically, the function is expected to handle conversions of units correctly but is producing unexpected results in certain cases, such as combining orthogonal units. The provided context does not include the specific code snippets necessary to diagnose and fix the issue directly. However, based on the description, it is clear that the problem lies in the logic handling unit conversions in the `convert_to` function or related functions within the `sympy.physics.units` module. To address this, we need to first identify the specific functions and lines of code involved in the unit conversion process and then check if they appropriately handle orthogonal units.

  "initial_message": "convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\r\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
