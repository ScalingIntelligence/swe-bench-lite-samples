Additionally, the 'sympy/physics/units/util.py' file contains the implementation of the 'convert_to' function used by the 'Quantity' class.

These are directly related to the functionality described in the issue. Additionally, the 'Quantity' class within 'quantities.py' also includes a method 'convert_to', which delegates to the 'util.convert_to' function. The issue describes a specific behavior related to this functionality, and all relevant code to address the issue seems to be present in the provided files.
