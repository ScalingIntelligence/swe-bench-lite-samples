The error message indicates that the conversion logic is producing unexpected results when combining these units, which might be due to incorrect handling of unit transformations or incomplete checks on the validity of the unit expression before conversion. It's essential to focus the search on the `convert_to` function and related methods such as `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, `quantity_simplify`, and `check_dimensions` within the `sympy/physics/units` module, as these are likely to contain the logic governing unit conversions and expression simplification. Additionally, examining the `Quantity` class within `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` could provide insights into how individual units are managed and converted. The search should also consider the `UnitSystem` class in `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` since it likely plays a role in how unit systems are defined and applied.",

The issue presents a scenario where `convert_to` produces unexpected results, suggesting an unintended conversion or combination of units. To address this, it's important to analyze the code segments related to unit conversion and scaling factors within the _QuantityMapper class, as this class seems to handle the mapping and conversion of quantities. Additionally, the Dimension class, which handles the multiplication and powering of dimensions, should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles dimensional operations without unintended outcomes. Furthermore, checking how units and dimensions are managed in the DimensionSystem and UnitSystem classes might provide insight into how conversions between different unit systems are handled and validated.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified are the methods within the _QuantityMapper class (`set_quantity_dimension`, `set_quantity_scale_factor`, `get_quantity_dimension`, and `get_quantity_scale_factor`) which directly deal with setting and retrieving dimensional and scale information for units. This is crucial for the `convert_to` function's operation. Additionally, methods in the Dimension class (`_eval_power`, `__mul__`) are critical as they define how dimensions are combined or altered, which is fundamental to unit conversion. The UnitSystem's method `get_dimensional_expr` also plays a part in expressing units in terms of dimensions, which can affect conversion outcomes.\n\nThese identified spans offer insight into where the potential issue might lie in the sympy codebase, focusing on the correct handling and processing of units and dimensions during conversion.",

The user expects the unchanged original expression, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. The provided search results show the `convert_to` function along with related utility functions and methods within the `Quantity` class. Both `convert_to` implementations are found, one directly in the `util.py` file and another as a method in the `Quantity` class, which calls the former. It appears that the main issue could be due to how the conversion matrix is computed or used in the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function. The current context already includes definitions for dimensions, units, and quantity mapping, which are foundational for understanding the conversion logic. These insights are crucial for identifying where the conversion might be going wrong. Given the issue's complexity and reliance on correct dimensional analysis, further examination of these core components could yield the necessary insights. However, based on the provided materials and the detailed examination of the functions concerned with unit conversions, it seems adequate to isolate the relevant code spans for further investigation.",
