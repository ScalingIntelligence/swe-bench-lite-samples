The user expects that converting `joule*second` to `joule` would either return the original expression unchanged, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. Instead, an unexpected result `joule**(7/9)` is obtained. The issue is related to how the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` and `convert_to` functions process units and dimensions, especially when dealing with orthogonal units. By analyzing the provided code, it becomes clear that the `convert_to` function uses the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function to determine if the conversion is possible and then applies a scaling factor. The unexpected result could be due to an incorrect handling of the units in the conversion matrix or in the scaling factors calculation. The provided code spans from `sympy/physics/units/util.py` are relevant as they directly involve the implementation of the functions under scrutiny, `convert_to` and `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, which are central to the issue's resolution.",
