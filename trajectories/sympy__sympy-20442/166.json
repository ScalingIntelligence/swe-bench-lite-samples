The examples provided show unexpected results, particularly when converting joule*second to joule. This suggests that the logic in convert_to might be incorrectly handling cases where units are not directly convertible. The relevant code spans are found in the Quantity class's method convert_to in 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py' and the convert_to function in 'sympy/physics/units/util.py'. The convert_to method in the Quantity class is a wrapper that calls the convert_to function in the util module. The convert_to function in the util module contains the core logic for conversion, including handling iterable targets, checking if expr is an Add or has Quantities, and calculating the total scale factor. It also uses _get_conversion_matrix_for_expr to determine if the conversion is possible and calculates the conversion matrix accordingly. These code spans are directly related to the issue as they handle the conversion logic and could be the source of the unexpected behavior described.",

Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"
