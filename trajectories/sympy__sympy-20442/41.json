The key points in the issue direct our focus to the 'convert_to' function and its related methods, especially where unit conversions are processed. From the search results, the critical code spans are located mainly in 'sympy/physics/units/util.py', and they include the '_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr' function which determines the conversion matrix for an expression, and the 'convert_to' function itself which handles the conversion of expressions to target units. Additionally, there's a reference to the 'convert_to' method within the 'Quantity' class in 'sympy/physics/units/quantities.py'. These functions seem to be directly implicated in the unit conversion process that is the main point of concern in the reported issue. The analysis of these code spans could help in understanding and potentially rectifying the handling of unit conversions as described in the issue.
