The user has provided a detailed code snippet that demonstrates the problem using SymPy's MatrixSymbol and assumptions. The search results include two files, 'refine.py' and 'ask.py', which are relevant because they handle the refinement of expressions and asking of logical propositions based on assumptions, respectively. The 'refine' function in 'refine.py' is particularly relevant as it is used to refine the product of a matrix and its transpose, which should be an identity matrix. This refinement process is key to understanding why the total sum of the elements might be zero instead of 'n'. The 'ask' function in 'ask.py' is also relevant for checking the properties and assumptions of the matrix, such as whether it is orthogonal or diagonal, but it does not directly address the sum calculation issue. Given these elements, it seems the 'refine' function is critical for addressing the reported issue. However, the search results do not directly provide the part of the code responsible for the sum calculation, which is crucial for resolving the issue.

The user's code demonstrates that the sum of the elements of the identity matrix M.T * M is incorrectly computed as 0 instead of 'n'. This suggests an issue with how the matrix multiplication and summation are handled. The analysis focuses on relevant code spans in the search results that could be involved in this computation. Important sections include matrix multiplication (MatMul), and the summation of matrix elements. The code span 'MatMul._entry' in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py' contains the logic for computing individual entries of the resultant matrix in a multiplication operation, which could be relevant to understanding how the sum of all elements (including those of the identity matrix) is computed. Additionally, the 'refine_MatMul' function in the same file could contain logic that incorrectly simplifies the identity matrix, leading to unexpected results. These are the key areas to examine further.",
