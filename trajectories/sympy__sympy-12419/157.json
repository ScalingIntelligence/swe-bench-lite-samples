The _entry method in MatMul defines how matrix multiplication entries are calculated, involving a sum over the product of corresponding elements.\n2. The _entry method in MatrixSymbol and its subclasses return MatrixElement objects.\n3. The doit method in MatrixElement and MatrixSymbol evaluate these elements, potentially leading to evaluation issues that could affect the total sum.\n4.

Specifically, it now checks if both matrices involved in the multiplication are identities and if so, returns the product of the coefficient and the matrix size. This should resolve the issue where the sum of all elements of an identity matrix was incorrectly computed as 0 instead of 'n'. With this change, the total sum of the elements of an identity matrix should now be correctly computed as 'n'.",
