The user assumes that a matrix M is orthogonal and constructs an identity matrix from it. They then evaluate the sum of its diagonal elements and the total sum of all its elements. While the sum of the diagonal elements correctly evaluates to 'n', the total sum of all elements unexpectedly evaluates to 0 instead of 'n'. This suggests a potential bug or an issue with SymPy's handling of sums of matrix elements under the assumption of orthogonality. In the search results, the 'AskOrthogonalHandler' class in 'sympy/assumptions/handlers/matrices.py' handles assumptions related to orthogonal matrices. The 'assuming' context manager in 'sympy/assumptions/assume.py' might also be relevant as it manages global assumptions. While these spans do not directly address the sum issue, they are likely part of the infrastructure involved in handling the identity matrix creation and assumptions.",
