The user has observed that while element-wise checks and the sum of diagonal elements yield expected results, the total sum of all elements unexpectedly returns 0 instead of 'n'. Given the context and the provided code snippet, it's clear that the issue occurs in the evaluation of the sum of all elements of a matrix that is expected to be an identity matrix due to matrix multiplication under the assumption of orthogonality. Therefore, the focus of the search should be on the sympy/matrices directory, specifically on any code that deals with matrix summation or identity matrix properties.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves handling of an identity matrix in SymPy, specifically related to the sum of its elements. The user found that when evaluating the total sum of the elements of an identity matrix derived from a multiplication of an orthogonal matrix with its transpose, the result was zero instead of 'n' which is expected for an identity matrix. This discrepancy was observed when using the `Sum` function over all elements of the matrix. The search results provided multiple files within the sympy.matrices.expressions module which are potentially relevant to this issue as they involve matrix operations, matrix expressions, and summation functions.\n\nThe relevant code spans to focus on are those that deal with matrix multiplication (`MatMul`), matrix addition (`MatAdd`), defining an identity matrix (`Identity`), handling matrix elements (`MatrixExpr._entry`), and calculating sums over matrix elements. Specifically, the `MatMul._entry` method and its handling of matrix multiplication including summation over indices is directly related to the operation that produced the identity matrix in the user's code.\n\nAdditionally, the `MatAdd` class and its `_entry` method are relevant as they handle addition which could be used implicitly if the sum of matrix elements becomes a combination of entries and must therefore be checked for how zero-valued entries might affect the sum. Lastly, the `MatrixExpr._entry` method, which is a base method for accessing matrix elements, is fundamental in determining how each element of a matrix is accessed and computed, and thus crucial in debugging the sum calculation.",

  "initial_message": "Sum of the elements of an identity matrix is zero\nI think this is a bug.\r\n\r\nI created a matrix by M.T * M under an assumption that M is orthogonal.  SymPy successfully recognized that the result is an identity matrix.  I tested its identity-ness by element-wise, queries, and sum of the diagonal elements and received expected results.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I attempt to evaluate the total sum of the elements the result was 0 while 'n' is expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy import Q as Query\r\n\r\nn = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\ni, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\nM = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)\r\n\r\ne = None\r\nwith assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):\r\n    e = refine((M.T * M).doit())\r\n\r\n# Correct: M.T * M is an identity matrix.\r\nprint(e, e[0, 0], e[0, 1], e[1, 0], e[1, 1])\r\n\r\n# Correct: The output is True True\r\nprint(ask(Query.diagonal(e)), ask(Query.integer_elements(e)))\r\n\r\n# Correct: The sum of the diagonal elements is n\r\nprint(Sum(e[i, i], (i, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\n\r\n# So far so good\r\n# Total sum of the elements is expected to be 'n' but the answer is 0!\r\nprint(Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\n```\n"
