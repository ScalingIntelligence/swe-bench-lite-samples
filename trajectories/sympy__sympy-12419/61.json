The user expected the total sum of the elements to be 'n', but it was found to be 0. The provided search results contain code snippets from the SymPy library, specifically from files related to matrix operations such as multiplication, trace, addition, and matrix expressions. To diagnose the issue, it's crucial to focus on the MatMul class and its methods, particularly '_entry', which calculates the entry of a matrix multiplication result. This method uses a sum over the product of elements from the matrices involved in the multiplication. The issue might be related to how this sum is computed or how the identity matrix property is maintained during these computations. Additionally, the Trace class and its methods are also relevant, as the sum of the diagonal elements is correctly computed but the total sum is not, indicating a potential problem with the sum computation across the entire matrix. The provided search results do not directly point to the exact issue but provide context and methods that are likely involved in the computation causing the problem.",
