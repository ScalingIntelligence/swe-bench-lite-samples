The key part of the code provided by the user is where the total sum of the elements of the matrix 'e' is evaluated. This involves a nested Sum operation.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code span is within the MatMul class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py'. Specifically, the '_entry' method in the MatMul class is where the matrix multiplication entries are calculated. This method uses a nested Sum operation similar to what the user employed in their script. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the nested Sum operation is implemented in the MatMul class.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the Identity class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', the '_entry' method defines the entries of an identity matrix, which are 1 for diagonal elements and 0 otherwise. This is consistent with the expected behavior when checking individual elements of the identity matrix.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant code spans are the '_entry' method in the MatMul class, which involves the Sum operation for matrix multiplication, and potentially the '_entry' method in the Identity class, which defines the entries of the identity matrix. Tracking the Sum operations in these methods could lead to the root cause of the issue where the total sum of the identity matrix elements is 0 instead of 'n'.",
