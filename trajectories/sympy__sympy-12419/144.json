Specifically, the code snippet provided (\"Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()\") might not be correctly summing the elements of the identity matrix. To address this, it would be beneficial to investigate the `Sum`, `MatrixExpr`, and related classes in SymPy that handle matrix operations and summations.",

The issue is present in the total sum of the elements of a matrix obtained by multiplying a matrix `M` with its transpose, i.e., `M.T * M`. It is known that this product should yield an identity matrix when `M` is orthogonal. The user provides a code snippet demonstrating the unexpected result of the total sum operation. The provided file context identifies several key areas in the codebase that are likely relevant, including the `MatMul` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` and the `Sum` class in `sympy/concrete/summations.py`, focusing on the `_entry` method of `MatMul` and the `doit` method of `Sum`. The search results provide additional context for the `MatMul` class, particularly its `_entry` method, which is crucial for understanding how matrix multiplication entries are computed, including how sums are handled. This method constructs a sum over the product of elements from two matrices. The sum in question is defined using `Sum` from `sympy.concrete.summations` and includes the computation of `coeff*X[i, k]*Y[k, j]` which relates to the elements of the resulting matrix from the multiplication.
