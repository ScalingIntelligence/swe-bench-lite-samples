This issue seems to be related to how the sum of matrix elements is calculated. In the provided code, the `Sum` class in `sympy/concrete/summations.py` performs the summation operations. The `doit` method in this class is responsible for evaluating the sum, and it includes handling for embedded sums and summation limits. Given the context, the relevant code spans would likely include the `Sum.__new__`, `Sum.doit`, and possibly `Sum._eval_is_zero` methods from `sympy/concrete/summations.py`, as they directly deal with summation operations and could be where the issue arises. Additionally, the `Sum.is_convergent` method could also be relevant if the sum operation involves handling infinite sequences or limits, although the issue appears to be more about an incorrect finite sum result. The other provided files and methods, though part of the SymPy matrix expression handling, do not directly address the summation problem highlighted in the issue.",
