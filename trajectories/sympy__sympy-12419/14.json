The user expects the total sum of the elements of an identity matrix to be 'n' (the size of the matrix), but they are getting 0 instead. Given the provided context and the user's code, it appears that the problem might be in how the summation is being handled, possibly in the MatrixExpr class or in the Sum functionality within SymPy. To narrow down the issue, we should focus on the files and functions related to matrix expressions and summation in SymPy.",

The MatMul class in sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py also contains a method for calculating matrix multiplication entries that involves summation, relating to the reported issue.
