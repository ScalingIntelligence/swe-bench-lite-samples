The `_eval_matrix_mul` method accurately captures element-wise operations during matrix multiplication, which the summation overlooking of identity matrices may be causing the issue at hand. Additionally, the `refine` function within `assumptions.refine` shows how expressions are handled under respective assumptions, possibly integrating assumptions concerning matrix properties with their operations. As such, both contexts are key as they provide the foundational knowledge on how matrix operations and assumptions interplay, enabling more efficient handling and localization of any bug likely occurring during the process.",
