The relevant code spans should focus on the manipulation and evaluation of matrix operations, particularly the MatMul class and its doit method since the user performs M.T * M, and the sum of the elements being incorrectly calculated. There are also traces in the search results indicating potential cores or avenues leading to inaccuracies within these critical operations. The MatAdd class also appears important because it involves the addition of matrices, and the sum of elements might be tied to the addition behavior. Since DotProduct, Trace, MatrixElement, and MatrixSymbol also interact with matrix elements extensively, their doit methods are relevant, especially for understanding the element-wise operations and summing behaviors across matrix manipulations. Importantly, the specific method `trace` and its relation to the sum of diagonal elements in matrices, makes the Trace.doit method contextually important.",

This issue is related to matrix operations and their sums. The provided file context shows relevant files such as `matmul.py`, `matadd.py`, `dotproduct.py`, `trace.py`, and `matexpr.py`, which are directly related to matrix operations including multiplication, addition, dot product, trace, and matrix element operations. The new search results include additional files such as `expr_with_limits.py` and `ask.py`, which are relevant to understanding the sum operations and assumptions applied to the matrix M. The `ExprWithLimits` class and its subclass `AddWithLimits` handle summation operations which are crucial for the sum calculation reported as buggy. The `AssumptionKeys` class in `ask.py` is also relevant as it includes the `orthogonal` predicate, which is used in the reported issue. Therefore, the code spans from these files are relevant to the reported issue.",

This suggests a potential bug in the summation logic for matrices.\n\nFirst, we review the existing context to see if any relevant files have already been identified. The provided files include `matmul.py`, `matadd.py`, `dotproduct.py`, `trace.py`, `matexpr.py`, and `expr_with_limits.py`. Notably, `matmul.py` contains the `MatMul` class and its `doit` method, which is relevant for matrix multiplication. Additionally, `trace.py` includes the `Trace` class, relevant for trace operations, but not directly for the sum of all elements.\n\nIn the new search results, we see `expr_with_limits.py` which contains classes and methods related to expressions with limits. This could be relevant for the summation over matrix elements. Specifically, the `AddWithLimits` class and its methods like `_eval_factor` and `_eval_expand_basic` appear to handle operations involving sums, which could include summing all elements of a matrix.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans should include those from `expr_with_limits.py` where the summation of elements is handled.
