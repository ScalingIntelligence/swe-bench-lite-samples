Notably, the Identity class provides methods for checking properties such as rows, columns, and individual entries, which could be relevant to understanding the behavior of summing all elements in the matrix. The Transpose and MatMul classes are also pertinent as they handle matrix multiplication and transposition, which are central to the user's code.

The user's script uses SymPy to handle matrix operations and checks various properties of the resulting matrix, which is expected to be an identity matrix. However, the total sum of the elements is incorrectly computed as 0 instead of 'n'.\n\nThe current file context and the new search results contain code related to matrix operations in SymPy, including classes like MatrixExpr, MatrixSymbol, Identity, and MatMul. These classes handle properties and operations of matrices such as transposition, inverse, and matrix multiplication.\n\nThe MatMul class in the search results contains the method `_entry`, which is likely responsible for computing the entries of the resulting matrix from a matrix multiplication. This method uses Sum to compute the resulting elements, which might be where the issue occurs when summing over all elements.\n\nTo address the reported issue, we need to identify the part of the code that handles the summation of all elements for an identity matrix and verify if there are any conditions or assumptions that lead to the incorrect sum of 0 instead of 'n'.",

However, in the context of identity matrices, there are assumptions and conditions that might not be handled explicitly, leading to the observed issue where the total sum of elements is incorrectly calculated as 0 instead of 'n'.
