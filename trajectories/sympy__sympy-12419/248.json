This involves understanding how the identity matrix is represented and how sum operations are performed on it. The search results include key components of the SymPy library's matrix expression handling, such as MatrixExpr, MatrixSymbol, and Identity classes. Notably, the Identity class defines a matrix as an identity matrix and could be relevant to the issue at hand. The ZeroMatrix class, which could also affect sum calculations if incorrectly instantiated, is also present. The refine_MatMul function stands out as it refines matrix multiplication expressions. If the matrix multiplication result is expected to be an identity matrix (as per user assumptions), this refinement function might be where the orthogonal property justifies the result being an identity matrix. However, since the issue concerns the total sum of elements not equaling 'n', the focus should be on how sums are computed in the context of these matrix expressions. Thus, relevant spans include those that define or manipulate identity matrices and their properties, as well as those handling summation operations, to investigate potential discrepancies.",
