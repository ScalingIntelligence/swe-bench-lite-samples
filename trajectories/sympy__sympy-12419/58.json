The expected result of the total sum of elements in an identity matrix of size 'n' is 'n', but the code produces 0. This suggests a potential problem with how the sum operation is being handled or how the identity matrix properties are being evaluated.

This discrepancy is crucial for understanding where the calculation of the total sum of elements might be going wrong. We need to check the `MatMul` class because it is responsible for matrix multiplication operations, which could lead to the identity matrix creation in the code. The `_entry` method of `MatMul` is particularly interesting as it involves calculating individual elements of the resulting matrix after multiplication, and sums are calculated when mapping multiplication between the original matrices. The issue might be in how these sums are computed or how the elements are being extracted. The `Identity` class is also essential because it defines the properties and operations of an identity matrix, which is the matrix primarily involved in this bug report.",
