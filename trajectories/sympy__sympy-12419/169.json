The user has already tested the identity-ness of the matrix using various methods but encounters the incorrect sum when summing all elements. The code involves operations on MatrixSymbol objects, assumptions about the matrix properties (like orthogonality), and SymPy's symbolic manipulation. Relevant files and classes likely include those handling matrix expressions, assumptions, and possibly sum operations. Given the context and provided files, it seems necessary to focus on the sum operation logic and assumptions handling in the context of matrix expressions.",

The key elements to focus on are the classes and methods involved in matrix operations such as MatMul, MatAdd, and Trace, as well as the doit method which evaluates these expressions. Additionally, the assumption handling related to orthogonality (as seen in AskOrthogonalHandler) might also be relevant. The search results provide a comprehensive overview of these operations and related methods. Particularly, the 'doit' methods in MatMul, MatAdd, and Trace classes would be crucial to inspect for the logic handling the evaluation of matrix operations. Also, the canonicalization rules for Matrix Expressions might influence the evaluation outcome.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about the total sum of elements in an identity matrix, which is supposedly zero instead of 'n'. This should be identified in the `MatMul` and `Trace` classes where the identity matrix operations are handled. We are focusing on the `doit` methods to see how the identity matrix is created and its sum is evaluated. The Search results include 'MatMul' and 'MatAdd' classes with 'doit' methods that process the identity matrix. However, after analyzing the code section bedore AI prompt, the simplified from issue component 'Sum(e[i,j], (i,0,n-1), (j,0, n-1). doit())' has all relevant files and codes, so there are no new issus to address.
