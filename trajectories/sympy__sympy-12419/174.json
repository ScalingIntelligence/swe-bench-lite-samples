The doit method likely contains the logic for performing the matrix operations that result in the identity matrix. However, further inspection is needed to determine if the issue lies within this method or elsewhere in the logic that follows it.\n\nGiven the context, the relevant code spans appear to be those that involve the doit method and possibly the surrounding rules and logic that control how matrices are processed and summed. These spans might hold clues as to why the total sum of the identity matrix's elements does not yield the expected result.\n\nThus, the identified spans focus on the MatMul.doit and its surrounding implementation details, which are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",

The MatMul and Identity classes in matmul.py and matexpr.py seem particularly relevant due to their handling of matrix multiplication and identity properties respectively. Additionally, the Sum class in summations.py handles summation of matrix elements which is directly related to the task at hand. The .doit() methods in these classes are especially applicable, as they perform deep operations that could affect the evaluation of the sum of elements.
