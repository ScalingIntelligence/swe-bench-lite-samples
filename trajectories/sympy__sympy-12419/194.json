To address this, we need to examine how the identity matrix is defined and how its elements are evaluated within SymPy. The search results reveal relevant code spans, particularly the `Identity` class and its `_entry` method, which determines the value of each element in the identity matrix. If `i == j`, the element is `S.One` (1), otherwise, it is `S.Zero` (0). This logic aligns with the definition of an identity matrix, where the sum of all elements should indeed be 'n', the size of the matrix if correctly implemented. Therefore, the focus should be on how the total sum calculation is performed, and whether there might be a mistake in how the sum of all elements is being computed. The provided code spans are relevant in understanding the element representation in the identity matrix but do not directly address the summation issue.",
