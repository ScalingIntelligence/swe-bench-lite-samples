This is critical to resolve because it affects the correctness of calculations involving identity matrices in SymPy. From reviewing the provided context and search results, it appears the issue may lie in how the summation of matrix elements is being computed. Although the context provided handlers for handling orthogonal matrices and their transformations, the search results provide more detailed insights into how matrix multiplication (MatMul) is handled in SymPy, specifically in the '_entry' method for calculating individual elements of the resulting matrix. This method uses a nested loop to compute the sum of products for each matrix element, which is foundational when dealing with matrix multiplication and sums. Thus, this part of the code is likely relevant for addressing the user's issue concerning the total sum of elements in a matrix. Furthermore, the 'refine_MatMul' function in the search results seems relevant as it deals with refining matrix multiplication under certain assumptions, potentially touching on cases where an identity matrix should be recognized. The provided context also includes how SymPy assumes and handles orthogonal matrices, which is directly related to the user's scenario. Therefore, both the '_entry' method in MatMul and the 'refine_MatMul' function should be examined more closely to debug why the sum of elements in the identity matrix is not evaluating as expected.",

The _entry method in MatMul class specifically deals with nested summations using Dummy variables and the Sum function, which is likely where the reported issue arises.

  "initial_message": "Sum of the elements of an identity matrix is zero\nI think this is a bug.\r\n\r\nI created a matrix by M.T * M under an assumption that M is orthogonal.  SymPy successfully recognized that the result is an identity matrix.  I tested its identity-ness by element-wise, queries, and sum of the diagonal elements and received expected results.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I attempt to evaluate the total sum of the elements the result was 0 while 'n' is expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy import Q as Query\r\n\r\nn = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\ni, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\nM = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)\r\n\r\ne = None\r\nwith assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):\r\n    e = refine((M.T * M).doit())\r\n\r\n# Correct: M.T * M is an identity matrix.\r\nprint(e, e[0, 0], e[0, 1], e[1, 0], e[1, 1])\r\n\r\n# Correct: The output is True True\r\nprint(ask(Query.diagonal(e)), ask(Query.integer_elements(e)))\r\n\r\n# Correct: The sum of the diagonal elements is n\r\nprint(Sum(e[i, i], (i, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\n\r\n# So far so good\r\n# Total sum of the elements is expected to be 'n' but the answer is 0!\r\nprint(Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\n```\n"
