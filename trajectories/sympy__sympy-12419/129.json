This indicates a potential bug in the matrix multiplication or summation logic. The search results include code spans from 'matmul.py' that are relevant to matrix multiplication operations. Specifically, 'MatMul' class and its associated methods such as '__new__', '_entry', 'as_coeff_matrices', 'doit', etc., are implicated as they deal directly with matrix multiplication and entry calculations. These code spans are crucial for understanding how matrix multiplication is handled and how elements are summed up. The '_entry' method, in particular, is focused on calculating individual entries in the resulting matrix, which is directly related to the sum operation mentioned in the issue.

The 'MatMul' class contains a method '_entry' that performs the summation of elements when multiplying matrices. This method might be where the miscalculation originates. Additional scrutiny should be applied to the 'doit' method and 'Sum' function within the '_entry' method, as these are crucial for computing the sum of all elements in a matrix. Since the problem involves an identity matrix, the 'Identity' class from 'matexpr.py' might also be implicated in this issue. Further, exploring whether there are test cases or additional methods within 'matmul.py' or related files that could elucidate how the total sum of elements in an identity matrix is computed, especially in contrast to expected results when 'n' is expected as the sum, would be insightful.",
