This issue seems to be rooted in the `NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape` method, which handles the shape determination of the iterable. When the iterable is empty, as in the case of `Array([])`, the method encounters a `ValueError` because it expects at least two values to unpack (expected 2, got 0). This is evident in the traceback provided, which points to the specific line that raises the error: `elems, shapes = zip(*[f(i) for i in pointer])`. Given this context, the relevant code section that needs to be addressed to resolve this issue is the `NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape` method, as it directly handles the shape scanning functionality and fails when the iterable is empty. Identifying and modifying this specific code span could potentially fix the reported issue.",
