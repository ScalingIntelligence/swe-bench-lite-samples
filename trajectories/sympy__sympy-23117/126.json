Given the stack trace and the context provided, the relevant files are likely within the 'sympy/tensor/array' directory, focusing on the `ndim_array.py` and potentially related files such as `dense_ndim_array.py`. The key function to investigate is `_scan_iterable_shape` in the `NDimArray` class, which seems to handle the creation of the array from an iterable. Additionally, checking the `__new__` method of the `DenseNDimArray` class in `dense_ndim_array.py` is important for understanding the array creation process.",
