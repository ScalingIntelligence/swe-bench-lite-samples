This discrepancy suggests that there might be an issue with the handling of empty inputs specifically for `Array`. The key area to focus on is the method `_scan_iterable_shape` within the `NDimArray` class. This method is responsible for determining the shape of the iterable input. The traceback provided in the issue shows that the error occurs in this method when trying to unpack values from an empty iterable, leading to a `ValueError`. Reviewing this method, we see that it recursively checks the shape of the input. When the input is empty, it results in an attempt to unpack zero values, causing the error. This confirms that the method `_scan_iterable_shape` is indeed the relevant part of the codebase that needs to be addressed to handle empty inputs for `Array`.",
