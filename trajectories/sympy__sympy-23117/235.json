This behavior contrasts with that of Matrix, which allows for the creation of an empty Matrix without issue. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs in the '_scan_iterable_shape' method within the 'ndim_array.py' module. To resolve this, it is essential to locate the relevant code sections where the handling of empty arrays takes place and understand why it fails. The provided context suggests that the 'NDimArray' and 'DenseNDimArray' classes might be relevant, as they have methods '_scan_iterable_shape' and '_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs' that seem related to this issue.
