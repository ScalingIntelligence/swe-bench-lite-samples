The traceback provided indicates that the error occurs in the '_scan_iterable_shape' method within the 'NDimArray' class, specifically where an iterable is expected but none is provided, leading to a 'ValueError'. This suggests that the issue lies in how the 'Array' class processes the shape when no elements are provided. Analyzing the source code, the '_scan_iterable_shape' method indeed has the logic for scanning the shape of an iterable, and if an empty iterable is passed, the method fails at 'elems, shapes = zip(*[f(i) for i in pointer])' because 'pointer' is empty. In addition, the '_new' methods in 'ImmutableDenseNDimArray' and 'MutableDenseNDimArray' classes, both of which call '_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs', are also potential points of interest as they handle the creation and handling of ND arrays, which could be adjusted to support the creation of empty arrays. Specifically, these methods could be modified to explicitly handle the case where an iterable is empty, potentially setting a default shape for an empty array in such cases. However, as the task is to identify relevant code spans based on the reported issue without modifying the code, I will focus on the spans containing the methods involved in shape handling and array creation.",
