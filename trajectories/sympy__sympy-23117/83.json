This method is tasked with determining the shape of the iterable, but it fails when the iterable is empty, as it expects at least one element to determine the shape. The current file context and search results both point to the `ndim_array.py` file, specifically focusing on the `NDimArray._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` and `NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape` methods. The `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` method delegates the shape determination to `_scan_iterable_shape`, which fails due to the empty iterable.
