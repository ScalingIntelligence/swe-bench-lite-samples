The traceback provided points to the failure in the `_scan_iterable_shape` method within the `NDimArray` class in `sympy.tensor.array.ndim_array.py`. To investigate this issue, we need to look at the implementation of `_scan_iterable_shape`.\n\nAnalyzing the `_scan_iterable_shape` method, we see that it attempts to recursively determine the shape of the iterable. However, if the iterable is empty, it causes a `ValueError` because it expects to unpack two values but receives none. This is a clear match with the user's reported issue, where creating an empty Array fails because the function cannot handle empty iterables.\n\nTo address this issue, the `_scan_iterable_shape` method needs to be revisited to handle the case of empty iterables appropriately. This could be done by adding a special case check at the beginning of the method to return a default shape when the iterable is empty.\n\nGiven the strong relevance of the code in the `NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape` span to the reported issue, I will mark this span as relevant.",
