This discrepancy in behavior points to the need for a more deliberate approach to handling empty arrays within the SymPy library. The traceback indicates that when an empty Array is attempted to be created, it raises a ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0). This error arises from the internal handling of array creation within SymPy, specifically related to the method _scan_iterable_shape in the ndim_array.py file. To address this issue, a specialized handling might be needed for empty Arrays at their creation point. The search results (especially from sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py) contain a method _scan_iterable_shape which is likely where the ValueError is originating from. Another significant file is sympy/tensor/array/expressions/array_expressions.py which defines the Array, ArraySymbol, ArrayElement, and related classes. The implementation of ZeroArray in this file could potentially play a role in handling empty arrays without errors. Reviewing these specific areas of the codebase for potential fixes or enhancements should be considered.",
