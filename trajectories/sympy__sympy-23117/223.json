This issue lies in the handling of the input parameters for the creation of the Array. The search results provided two main sections of interest: the method '_new' in both ImmutableDenseNDimArray and MutableDenseNDimArray classes, and the method '_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs' in the NDimArray class. Both sections handle the creation process of the Array, with '_new' methods calling '_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs'. The '_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs' method is responsible for managing the input shape and iterable, making it the primary suspect for the error. Since the issue arises when passing an empty iterable, further investigation into the handling of empty iterables within these methods is crucial. It seems that the current logic might not properly account for empty iterables, leading to the unpacking error. Identifying and extracting relevant code spans focused on handling empty iterables or any logic that governs the handling of input parameters in these methods is essential to address the reported issue.",

        "message": "The '_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs' method in 'ndim_array.py' is responsible for handling the inputs for creating an N-Dimensional Array in SymPy. This method is crucial for ensuring that the iterable and shape provided for creating an Array are correctly processed, especially for the case of an empty array, as it leads to the ValueError encountered in the issue. Reviewing the method reveals that it scans the iterable to determine its shape if not provided and handles the conversion of dictionary keys if the input is a dictionary. It also ensures that the shape consists of integers. The provided context suggests that the method might not have a specific check for the emptiness of the iterable, which could cause the error when an empty array is attempted to be created. Further examination and potential modification of this method might be necessary to handle empty arrays appropriately.",
