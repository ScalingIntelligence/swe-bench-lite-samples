The traceback points to the `_scan_iterable_shape` method in the `NDimArray` class, which is the likely source of the error when an empty iterable is passed to the `Array` constructor. This method is responsible for scanning the shape of the iterable, and it fails when the iterable is empty, as indicated by the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`. The search results confirm the presence of this method in the `ndim_array.py` file, specifically in the `NDimArray` class. The method tries to determine the shape of the iterable, and it crashes when it encounters an empty iterable.
