This is evident from the provided outputs where the pretty printer incorrectly displays the expression as a complex root form, while the LaTeX and str representations correctly show it as pi**exp(-1). A thorough examination of the provided code spans reveals that the PrettyPrinter class and its _print_Pow method are directly related to handling powers and their rendering in the pretty printer. The _print_Pow method deals with the printing of Pow objects, which is the type of expression in question (pi**(1/E)). This method checks for conditions like negative exponents and fractional exponents to determine how the power should be printed. Given the context of the issue, it's reasonable to focus on how expressions like pi**(1/E) are handled within the _print_Pow method, ensuring that complex root forms are not erroneously applied. Therefore, the relevant code spans are focused around the _print_Pow method within the PrettyPrinter class in the sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file.",

This output is not as expected when compared to LaTeX and str representations. The pretty printer should ideally match the output format of LaTeX and str. The key files to look at are those related to pretty printing and handling of mathematical expressions like Pow. The context already has relevant spans from 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', focusing on the PrettyPrinter class and its methods for handling Pow, particularly '_print_Pow'. The new search results bring in additional related files such as 'sympy/core/__init__.py', 'sympy/core/expr.py', and 'sympy/core/numbers.py', which provide further context on core functionalities related to expressions and numbers. The 'sympy/core/mul.py' and 'sympy/core/power.py' are also crucial as they deal with the arithmetic operations expected to affect the rendering of such expressions. After analyzing these, it's clear that the '_print_Pow' method in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' is crucial for resolving the issue around rendering, as it defines how Pow objects are translated into pretty print format. The additional files provide a broader understanding of SymPy's core functionalities but don't directly provide new insights into resolving this specific rendering issue.
