The relevant sections of code are found within the PrettyPrinter class, notably the _print_Pow method, which is responsible for printing powers. This method checks various conditions related to the exponent and base of the power to determine the proper rendering, including handling of negative one and rational exponents. Notably, it checks if the exponent e is negative and if it is a rational number, among other conditions. The search results confirm the presence of the _print_Pow method within the PrettyPrinter class, which aligns with the expected location where the issue would be addressed. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans are 'PrettyPrinter._print_Pow' and potentially any other methods it interacts with or conditions it checks, such as the handling of roots or negative exponents.
