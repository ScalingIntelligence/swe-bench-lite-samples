This discrepancy is observed in the sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py file, specifically in the _print_Pow method. The _print_nth_root method also appears relevant as it handles the rendering of roots, which is how the expression is being incorrectly interpreted. Both methods need to be reviewed to align their behavior with the expected output. Additionally, the corresponding LaTeX and str representations are correctly showing pi**exp(-1), indicating that the issue is isolated to the pretty printer.
