The search results provided include the 'PrettyPrinter' class, which is responsible for the pretty printing functionality in SymPy. Within this class, the '_print_Pow' method is of particular interest as it handles the pretty printing of power expressions, which includes the type of expression in the issue (pi**(1/E)). This method processes the base and exponent of the power expression and manages special cases such as negative exponents and fractional exponents. Given the issue description and the context of the code, the '_print_Pow' method is directly relevant to resolving the issue related to the incorrect pretty printing of pi**(1/E).",
