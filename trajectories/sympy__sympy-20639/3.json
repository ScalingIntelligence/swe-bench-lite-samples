Specifically, the _print_Pow and _print_nth_root methods in the PrettyPrinter class deal with the rendering of powers and roots, which are directly related to the issue at hand. Similarly, the _print_Pow method in the LatexPrinter and StrPrinter classes handle the LaTeX and string representations of powers, which are confirmed to be accurate in the issue description.
