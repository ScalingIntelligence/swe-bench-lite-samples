The relevant parts of the code to address this issue are the methods handling the pretty printing of Pow and nth_root, specifically within the PrettyPrinter class. The _print_Pow method delegates to _print_nth_root when handling certain types of exponents, and it's in _print_nth_root where the rendering of roots is managed. The spans identified in the search results directly relate to these methods, particularly the logic in _print_Pow that decides when to use _print_nth_root and the details within _print_nth_root itself.

Key functions like '_print_nth_root' handle special cases of roots, which could be relevant to the issue at hand concerning the rendering of pi**(1/E). Given the information, it's necessary to delve deeper into the '_print_Pow' method's handling of special bases like 'pi' and exponents involving 'E' or related constants. Additionally, any helper methods influencing these representations within the pretty printer module should be examined.
