The expected output is 'pi**exp(-1)', but the actual output is different. This suggests that the issue is related to the pretty printing of powers, specifically when the exponent is a non-integer. The relevant parts of the codebase to examine would be those handling the pretty printing and the rendering of powers. From the provided search results, I have identified the most relevant sections which handle the printing of powers in the PrettyPrinter class and other relevant classes in different printer modules. These sections include the '_print_Pow' method in the PrettyPrinter class, as well as similar methods in other printer classes such as JavaScriptCodePrinter, PythonCodePrinter, LatexPrinter, etc. Each of these methods deals with the printing of powers in their respective contexts, such as handling fractional exponents, negative exponents, and root notations. The primary focus would be on the '_print_Pow' method in the PrettyPrinter class, as it directly relates to the issue at hand. The analysis of these methods will help in understanding how non-integer powers are handled and rendered, and whether any specific conditions or default behaviors could lead to the incorrect rendering of 'pi**(1/E)'.",
