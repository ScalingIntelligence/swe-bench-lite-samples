Specifically, the _print_Pow method in this class handles the pretty printing of power expressions. Additionally, the LaTeX and str representations are handled by LatexPrinter and StrPrinter classes in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/printing/str.py', respectively, each with their own _print_Pow methods. Given that only the pretty printing is inaccurate, the focus should be on the PrettyPrinter class and its _print_Pow method. This method seems to struggle with non-integer exponents like 1/E, potentially due to its handling of rational exponents and root notation. Further, the commented parts of the code suggest investigative directions where additional non-evaluated conditions can occur.
