The file_context provided shows the PrettyPrinter class, particularly the _print_Pow and _print_nth_root methods which are relevant to handling power expressions and nth roots. The search results reaffirm the presence of these methods in the PrettyPrinter class but focus on the _print_Pow and _print_nth_root methods, which need to be examined for potential issues related to the rendering of pi**(1/E). These methods appear to be the main location for controlling how powers and roots are displayed in the pretty printer. Specifically, the conditionals for handling different forms of expressions in _print_Pow, particularly the check for whether the exponent is a Rational or not and the subsequent call to _print_nth_root, need to be assessed for handling pi**(1/E) correctly. Furthermore, the _print_nth_root method also needs review to ensure it handles the base and exponent accordingly, potentially correcting the rendering issue observed with pi**(1/E).",
