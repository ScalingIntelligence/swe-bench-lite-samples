The current implementation checks if the exponent is NegativeOne or if it can be represented as a fraction and handles it accordingly. For the case involving Pi and Exp1, the method falls back to the default handling, which might not produce the desired result. It is necessary to extend the _print_Pow method to specifically handle the combination of Pi and Exp1.

These sections handle the initialization of settings and the pretty printing of power expressions, respectively. \n\nThe new search results also point to the same file, `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The `_print_Pow` method in the `PrettyPrinter` class is highlighted again. This method handles the pretty printing of power expressions, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. \n\nGiven that the issue involves the rendering of a power expression, the `_print_Pow` method is considered the most relevant code span. It checks for specific conditions related to the exponent and base of the power, and it is likely where the correction needs to be made to address the inaccurate rendering of pi**(1/E).\n\nThe search task can be considered complete as the relevant code span has been identified.",

The current implementation checks if the exponent is NegativeOne or if it can be represented as a fraction and handles it accordingly.
