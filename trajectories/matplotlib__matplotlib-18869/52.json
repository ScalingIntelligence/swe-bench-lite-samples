The `__init__.py` file in the `matplotlib` directory seems to be a likely candidate as it often contains the version attribute. Additionally, the `setup.py` file could also be relevant as it handles the versioning during the setup process. We should focus on these files to find the current version definition and consider where new version comparison tools could be integrated.",

For quick version checks, exposing either a `version_info` tuple (which can be compared with other tuples) or a `LooseVersion` instance (which can be properly compared with other strings) would be a small usability improvement.\r\n\r\n(In practice I guess boring string comparisons will work just fine until we hit mpl 3.10 or 4.10 which is unlikely to happen soon, but that feels quite dirty :))\r\n<!--\r\nProvide a clear and concise description of the problem this feature will solve. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* I'm always frustrated when [...] because [...]\r\n* I would like it if [...] happened when I [...] because [...]\r\n* Here is a sample image of what I am asking for [...]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nI guess I slightly prefer `LooseVersion`, but exposing just a `version_info` tuple is much more common in other packages (and perhaps simpler to understand).  The hardest(?) part is probably just bikeshedding this point :-)\r\n<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of a way to accomplish what you want. For example:\r\n\r\n* Add an option so that when [...]  [...] will happen\r\n -->\r\n\r\n### Additional context and prior art\r\n\r\n`version_info` is a pretty common thing (citation needed).\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
