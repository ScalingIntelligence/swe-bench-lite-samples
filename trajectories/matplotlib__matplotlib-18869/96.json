The provided file context and search results focus on the Cairo backend of Matplotlib, specifically showing how it handles the cairo library's version with 'cairo.version_info'. This aligns with the need for version information that can be compared, as it directly uses 'cairo.version_info' for checking compatibility. Therefore, the code span in the search results that deals with 'cairo.version_info' is highly relevant to the reported issue, as it provides a direct example of how version information can be used for comparison in the context of Matplotlib, even if it's for a different library.\n\nThe provided code context already has a version check using 'cairo.version_info', which is exactly the kind of functionality that the issue seeks to implement, but directly within Matplotlib's core version handling instead of relying on a third-party library's version info. This makes the identified span of code not only relevant but also highly indicative of how to approach the solution for the reported issue.",

Thanks for thinking of a way to improve Matplotlib.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore creating a new feature request please search the issues for relevant feature requests.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently matplotlib only exposes `__version__`.  For quick version checks, exposing either a `version_info` tuple (which can be compared with other tuples) or a `LooseVersion` instance (which can be properly compared with other strings) would be a small usability improvement.\r\n\r\n(In practice I guess boring string comparisons will work just fine until we hit mpl 3.10 or 4.10 which is unlikely to happen soon, but that feels quite dirty :))\r\n<!--\r\nProvide a clear and concise description of the problem this feature will solve. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* I'm always frustrated when [...] because [...]\r\n* I would like it if [...] happened when I [...] because [...]\r\n* Here is a sample image of what I am asking for [...]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nI guess I slightly prefer `LooseVersion`, but exposing just a `version_info` tuple is much more common in other packages (and perhaps simpler to understand).  The hardest(?) part is probably just bikeshedding this point :-)\r\n<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of a way to accomplish what you want.
