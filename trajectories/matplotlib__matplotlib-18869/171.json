            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue of adding easily comparable version info to the toplevel in Matplotlib, we need to identify code spans that deal with version information. The issue suggests adding either a `version_info` tuple or a `LooseVersion` instance for easier version comparisons. \n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue: The issue specifically mentions the need for a `version_info` tuple or a `LooseVersion` instance for better version comparison. It indicates that the current version information is only available as a string via `__version__`, which is not optimally comparable without additional parsing.\n\n2. Reviewing the provided search results: \n   - In `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, there are several code spans related to version management and backend configurations. Notably, the span with id 'imports' contains imports of `packaging.version` and `numpy`, which could be relevant for version comparison. The span with id '__getattr__' contains logic to dynamically set the `__version__` attribute using `setuptools_scm`. The span with id '_check_versions' contains version checking logic for various dependencies, which could be relevant as a model for how to implement version comparison logic for Matplotlib itself. \n   - In `setup.py`, there are several spans related to setup and configuration options, including version management. The span with id 'docstring' contains version checks for Python, and the span with id 'impl:12' contains package data and build options, which could be relevant for integrating new version comparison features.\n\n3. Identifying relevant code spans: \n   - The span with id '__getattr__' in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` is crucial as it dynamically sets the `__version__` attribute, which is directly related to the issue. \n   - The span with id '_check_versions' could serve as a model for implementing version comparison logic since it already contains similar checks for dependencies.\n   - The span with id 'docstring' and 'impl:12' in `setup.py` provide context on version management during setup and build processes, which could be necessary for integrating changes related to version comparison.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans seem relevant to the reported issue and provide a good starting point for implementing version comparison features.",
