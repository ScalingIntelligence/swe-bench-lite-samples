Additionally, the `MatrixOperations` class in `common.py` and the `numbers.py` file could also be relevant due to the use of matrices and Rational numbers in the issue description.",

The user has provided examples showing that certain expressions involving symbols and adding or subtracting rational numbers simplify as expected, but expressions involving Rational numbers within trigonometric functions (specifically sin and cos) do not simplify as expected. \n\nThe search results include code spans from the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` files. These code spans cover the definitions and evaluation methods for the sin and cos functions, as well as the simplify function. The code spans in the trigonometric file show the logic for evaluating sin and cos functions, including how they handle different types of arguments such as numbers, Add, Mul, etc., and special cases involving pi coefficients. The simplify function code span includes the overall logic for simplifying expressions, including handling trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, logarithms, combinatorial functions, and more. \n\nGiven the issue, the relevant code spans are those that deal directly with the evaluation and simplification of trigonometric functions, particularly those involving Rational arguments or complex expressions that might not simplify as intended. The identified spans include the eval methods for sin and cos, the _eval_expand_trig methods which handle the expansion of trigonometric functions, and the simplify function itself which orchestrates the simplification process across different types of functions and expressions.",
