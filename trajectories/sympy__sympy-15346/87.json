The user observed that while sin and cos with symbols can be simplified, and rational numbers themselves can be simplified, the combination of sin/cos with Rational numbers does not simplify as expected. This indicates a need to investigate the simplification logic specifically related to trigonometric functions and Rational numbers in the context of matrix operations. The relevant files and functions to focus on include `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, and `sympy/matrices/common.py`. Additionally, the `trigsimp` and `fu` modules might contain simplification patterns that are not being applied correctly.",

The user also provides code examples showing the issue with Matrix operations involving trigonometric functions with Rational arguments. The search results include relevant code spans from 'sympy/simplify/fu.py', 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', 'sympy/matrices/common.py', 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py', and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py'.

The code in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' specifically targets the simplification of trigonometric expressions by manipulating sin and cos functions, while 'trigsimp_groebner' in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' uses Groebner bases for more complex trigonometric simplifications. 'MatrixOperations.simplify' in 'sympy/matrices/common.py' applies simplification to matrix elements, which could be relevant for the user's issue with Matrix operations.
