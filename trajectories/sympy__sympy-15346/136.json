The user provided examples where simplifications work for symbols and pure rational numbers, but not for trigonometric functions applied to Rational numbers. The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` files. Specifically, the code spans related to the `sin` and `cos` classes and their methods such as `eval`, `_eval_expand_trig`, `_eval_as_leading_term`, `_eval_is_real`, and `_eval_is_finite` are relevant. Additionally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is a key part of the simplification process and should be considered. These code spans are relevant as they deal directly with the evaluation, simplification, and properties of trigonometric functions, which is central to the reported issue.",
