The user provided examples where simplification works for symbols and Rational numbers separately but fails when combined in matrices or dot products. The relevant code spans should be identified from the search results that deal with trigonometric simplification and handling of Rational numbers. From the search results, the most relevant files are 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' and 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' which contain functions for trigonometric simplification. Specifically, the functions TR0, TR2i, TR11, and TR12i in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' and the 'exptrigsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' are relevant as they deal with simplifying trigonometric expressions. However, the issue mentioned by the user suggests that the current simplification methods may not be handling the interaction between Rational numbers and trigonometric functions effectively. The identified code spans, especially those handling trigonometric simplification (like TR2i and exptrigsimp), might need to be reviewed and possibly extended or adjusted to handle Rational numbers more gracefully in complex expressions.",

Specifically, ensure advanced simplification algorithms are active even when the arguments passed to trigonometric functions are simple Rational numbers (not just integers) and can be further decomposed potentially for canonicalization into expressions that conventional simplification utilities can pick up. This change should enhance how SymPy handles rational number arguments in sin, cos, and possibly other trigonometric functions.\n\nThe modifications should focus on the `trig_split` function and the helper function `pow_cos_sin` to ensure they handle Rational numbers better. Specifically, lines within `pow_cos_sin` that check for trigonometric functions need updating to include Rational numbers.",
