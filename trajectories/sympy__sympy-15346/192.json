These files and spans seem relevant to the issue, particularly the functions and transformations described within them. The relevant spans from the 'fu.py' file appear to directly address trigonometric simplification functions involving cos, sin, and their interactions. This includes multiple transformation functions (like TR2i, TR3, TR8, TR10i, TR11, TR12i) designed to manipulate and simplify trigonometric expressions. In 'trigonometric.py,' there are evaluations for providing information about the nature (e.g., rational, algebraic) of trigonometric functions, which can guide further simplification strategies. Finally, 'trigsimp.py' contains methods attempting to simplify such expressions using Groebner bases, possibly offering more complex or algebraic simplification techniques.

'sympy/matrices/common.py' is particularly important as it involves matrix operations that are possibly not handling the simplification of trigonometric elements involving rational numbers as expected.",

The search results include functions from the sympy library that handle trigonometric simplification. Among them, 'TR2i', 'TR3', 'TR8', 'TR10i', 'TR11', and 'TR12i' are relevant as they are designed for simplifying trigonometric expressions. The 'fu.py' file contains these functions and might be the source of the problem, particularly the 'TR2i' function which deals with simplifying expressions involving sin and cos functions. Additionally, the 'trigsimp_groebner' function in 'trigsimp.py' is also relevant as it uses Groebner bases for simplifying trigonometric expressions. The 'TrigonometricFunction._eval_is_algebraic' method in 'trigonometric.py' is also related as it checks if a trigonometric function can be expressed algebraically, which might be relevant to the simplification process. These sections can help in diagnosing the issue and understanding the algorithms used for trigonometric simplification.",
