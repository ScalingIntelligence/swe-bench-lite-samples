The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is particularly relevant because it handles the simplification of expressions, including those involving trigonometric functions. The issue suggests that the simplification should ideally transform expressions like `sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25))` into a simpler form, likely using trigonometric identities.

The user observed that expressions involving sin and cos with symbolic arguments simplify correctly, as do those with rational arguments, but not when both are combined in a specific manner. The key elements to look for in the codebase are the implementations of sin and cos functions, specifically how they handle rational arguments and their combinations with symbolic arguments. Additionally, the simplify function's handling of trigonometric expressions is crucial. The search results do provide relevant code spans, particularly those involving the _eval_expand_trig and _eval_is_rational methods within the sin and cos classes, which are likely involved in the simplification process. Furthermore, the simplify function's logic and how it processes trigonometric functions should also be examined. However, it appears that the search results might not cover all the necessary contexts required to fully address the issue, as there is a need to delve deeper into how precisely the functions handle arguments that are sums of a rational and a symbolic expression. It is recommended to conduct further searches or examine the codebase more comprehensively to find additional relevant code spans that could directly address the observed behavior.",
