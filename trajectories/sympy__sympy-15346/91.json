The user reports that expressions involving sin and cos with symbols and rational numbers are simplified correctly, but when these trigonometric functions are applied to Rational numbers within a matrix or direct computation, they do not simplify as expected. This suggests a need to investigate the simplification logic for trigonometric functions applied to Rational types. Focus should be on the trigonometric and simplification modules, specifically how they handle Rational inputs and how they interact within matrix operations.",

Specifically, the user observes that while sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y) simplifies correctly, expressions involving sin and cos with Rational arguments do not simplify as expected. This discrepancy is evident in the matrix operations and the direct trigonometric simplifications. The primary focus is on identifying the parts of the codebase responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions, particularly those involving Rational numbers. After analyzing the search results, several relevant code spans are found in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py'. These files contain functions and methods specifically designed for trigonometric simplification, such as TR2i, TR8, TR10i, and TR11 in 'fu.py', and the evaluation and expansion methods for sin and cos in 'trigonometric.py'. These methods are crucial for understanding how SymPy handles trigonometric simplifications and why the simplification might not be occurring as expected with Rational numbers. Additionally, the '_eval_is_rational' and '_eval_is_algebraic' methods in 'trigonometric.py' are relevant, as they hint at how SymPy might be treating Rational inputs within trigonometric functions.",
