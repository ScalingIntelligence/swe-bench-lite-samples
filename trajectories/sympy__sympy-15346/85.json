These files contain various simplification methods, trigonometric evaluations, and utility functions that might be relevant to the issue.

These files include 'sympy/simplify/fu.py', 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', and 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py'. Among these, the 'fu' module seems particularly relevant due to its focus on trigonometric simplification functions such as TR2i, TR8, TR9, and others. The 'trigonometric' module contains definitions for the sin and cos functions, which are central to the reported issue. Lastly, 'trigsimp.py' contains more general trigonometric simplification functions like trigsimp_groebner and exptrigsimp.
