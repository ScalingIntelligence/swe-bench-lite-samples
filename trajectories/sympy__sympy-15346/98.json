This suggests that the problem might lie in the specific handling of Rational numbers within the trigonometric simplification functions or in the broader simplification logic. To address this, it's necessary to focus on the trigonometric functions (sin and cos) and their potential interactions with Rational numbers, as well as the simplification pipeline that processes these functions. Specifically, the files `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `sympy/simplify/fu.py` are likely to contain relevant code snippets.",
