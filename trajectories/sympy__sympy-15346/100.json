            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the inability to simplify sin and cos functions when using Rational numbers in SymPy, particularly when dealing with Matrix operations and dot products involving trigonometric functions with Rational arguments. Key points from the issue include: 1. Simplification works for symbols and separate Rational numbers, but not for functions involving Rational numbers. 2. The expected behavior is that expressions like sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25)) should simplify to cos(x - y) style expressions. 3. The problem seems to be with the `simplify()` method when applied to such expressions. Analyzing the search results, particularly from `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, reveals several key areas of relevance: - Definitions of TrigonometricFunction and specific trigonometric functions like `cos`, including their evaluation methods and simplification rewrites. - The `simplify()` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, which is central to the issue, containing logic for simplifying expressions including trigonometric ones. - Functions like `TR11` and `TR12i` in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` which specifically target trigonometric simplification. These functions could be key to addressing the issue with simplifying expressions involving Rational numbers. Given these insights, the identified code spans in these files are directly relevant to the problem and likely contain the logic needed to resolve it. Further investigation into the methods handling trigonometric simplifications with Rational numbers in these files should be pursued.",
