Specifically, the user is trying to simplify expressions like sin(Rational(1, 50)) and cos(Rational(1, 50)), but they are not simplifying as expected. The issue seems to be related to how SymPy handles simplification of trigonometric functions with rational arguments. The key elements to look for in the code are methods and functions responsible for trigonometric simplification, especially those involving Rational numbers.\n\nIn the provided search results, we find several relevant files and spans of code that could be related to this issue. The file `sympy/simplify/fu.py` contains methods like `TR2i`, `TR8`, `TR11`, and `TR12i` which are likely involved in trigonometric simplification rules. The file `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` contains the `TrigonometricFunction` class and methods like `_eval_is_rational` and `_eval_is_algebraic`, which could impact how rational arguments are handled for trigonometric functions. Additionally, the `acos` and `atan` classes and their methods like `fdiff` and `_eval_is_rational` are also relevant.\n\nThe file `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` has the `trigsimp_groebner` function and `exptrigsimp`, indicating further trig simplification processes. The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is a broader simplification function that might also apply to the given issue. Based on the reported issue and the available code spans, these seem to be the most relevant sections of the codebase related to the difficulty in simplifying trigonometric expressions involving Rational numbers.",
