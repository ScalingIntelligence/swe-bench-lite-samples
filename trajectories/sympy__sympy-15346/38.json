The key elements to consider are functions and classes related to trigonometric simplification (like `trigsimp`, `trigsimp_old`, `TR8`, etc.) and matrix operations (like `MatrixOperations.simplify`).\n\nIn the current file context, the `trigsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` and the `simplify` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py` are already identified as relevant. These handle general trigonometric simplification and matrix simplification respectively.\n\nFrom the new search results, additional relevant code spans include:\n1. The `trigsimp_old` function in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`. This function contains an older implementation of trigonometric simplification which might be relevant given the issue involves older functionalities or compatibility.\n2. The `TR8` function in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`. This function is part of a strategy for simplifying trigonometric expressions and may contain specific logic suitable for dealing with the issue at hand.\n\nThese new findings, especially the older simplification method and the specialized trigonometric simplification rule (TR8), provide more context and potential solutions to the reported issue.",
