Specifically, the user is having trouble with simplifying expressions like sin(Rational(1, 50)) and cos(Rational(1, 50)). The search results provide several relevant code spans that could be related to this issue. Firstly, in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', there are spans for 'TrigonometricFunction', 'sin', 'cos', and methods like '_eval_expand_trig', '_eval_as_leading_term', '_eval_is_real', and '_eval_is_finite'. These are crucial as they define the behavior of sin and cos functions and how they should simplify. Secondly, in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', there is a 'simplify' span, which is the main function for simplifying expressions. Lastly, in 'sympy/matrices/common.py', there is a 'simplify' method for MatrixOperations, which might be relevant if the issue arises from matrix operations. These spans collectively cover the main areas where the simplification logic is implemented and can help determine why the simplification isn't occurring as expected for Rational numbers. However, the issue might also be related to the specific handling of trigonometric simplifications involving Rationals within the '_eval_expand_trig' method.",
