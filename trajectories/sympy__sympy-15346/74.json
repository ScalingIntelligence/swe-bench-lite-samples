The user provided examples where simplification works for symbols and basic Rational operations, but fails with more complex expressions involving Matrices and dot products. Given this, the relevant code spans should focus on the implementation and simplification strategies for trigonometric functions, especially concerning Rational inputs. \n\nAnalyzing the search results, several key areas are relevant:\n1. **sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py** - This file contains the base class `TrigonometricFunction` and specific implementations for cos and cot functions. While not directly addressing the simplification issue with Rational inputs, understanding the base class and how these specific functions are handled is crucial for building context.\n2. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py** - This file is highly relevant as it contains the `simplify` function, which is central to the issue. The function handles various strategies for simplification, including trigonometric simplification. Identifying how Rational inputs are managed within this function is key.\n3. **sympy/simplify/gammasimp.py** - This file, focusing on simplification of expressions involving gamma functions, is indirectly relevant as it provides insights into how SymPy handles specific types of simplification. The `_rf` class and its `eval` method are particularly interesting as they deal with factorials and rising factorials, which could have parallels in trigonometric simplification with Rational inputs.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified code spans should be from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, focusing on the `simplify` function and how it processes trigonometric and Rational inputs. The `TrigonometricFunction` class from `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` is also relevant for foundational understanding.",

The issue seems to be related to the simplification process and how trigonometric functions are evaluated with Rational arguments. The key elements to look for in the code spans are simplification functions and trigonometric functions such as sin and cos.Examining the search results, we find relevant code spans related to simplification in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' under the 'simplify' span. This function orchestrates the simplification process, including handling trigonometric expressions and rational numbers according to the provided context and search results. Also, the 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' file contains the 'cos' and 'TrigonometricFunction' spans, which are critical as they define the behavior and evaluation of cos and other trigonometric functions. These sections deal with the evaluation, expansion, and rewriting of trigonometric functions, which could influence how Rational-based trigonometric expressions are handled.Thus, the identified spans from the search results ('cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', 'cos._eval_expand_trig', 'cos._eval_as_leading_term', 'cos._eval_is_real', 'cos._eval_is_finite', etc.) within the 'cos' class and the 'TrigonometricFunction' class are highly relevant to the issue reported. They cover various aspects of trigonometric function behavior that might affect how an expression involving Rational numbers is simplified.Additionally, auxiliary simplification functions like 'nsimplify' in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' also play a vital role as they might be used during the simplification process, especially when dealing with numerical values.",

The user is specifically looking for the code in SymPy that handles these simplifications to understand why it might be failing for rational numbers.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, the focus appears to be on the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and the trigonometric functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. The `simplify` function contains logic for various simplification techniques including trigonometric simplification (`trigsimp`). The trigonometric functions file contains the definition of `cos` and its methods like `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` and `_eval_expand_trig`, which are critical for rewriting and expanding trigonometric expressions.\n\nThe search results also include the `cos` function and its methods, particularly `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` and `_eval_expand_trig`, which might be relevant for handling rational numbers. Also included is the `TrigonometricFunction` class and its methods like `_eval_is_rational` and `_eval_is_algebraic`, which could be pertinent to the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the issue description and the provided context, the identified spans in the `cos` class and its methods, as well as the `TrigonometricFunction` class, seem to be directly relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",
