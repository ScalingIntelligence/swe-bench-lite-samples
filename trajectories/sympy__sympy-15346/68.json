The user provided code examples that should produce simplified results but do not. This indicates a need to investigate functions and methods related to trigonometric simplification and rational numbers.\n\nLooking at the search results, we can see several relevant files and spans of code:\n\n1. `sympy/simplify/fu.py` contains functions related to trigonometric simplification such as `TR2i`, `TR3`, `TR8`, `TR10i`, and `TR11`. These functions are directly involved in simplifying trigonometric expressions, which is the core issue reported by the user.\n2. `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` includes definitions of trigonometric functions such as `sin`, `cos`, and their respective simplification methods, which are crucial for the reported issue.\n3. `sympy/core/numbers.py` includes the definition of `Rational` numbers, which are the numbers causing the issue in the trigonometric simplifications.\n4. `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` also contains functions related to trigonometric simplification, which could be relevant to resolving the issue.\n\nGiven these findings, we can identify specific spans within each file that are directly related to the issue: functions and methods that handle trigonometric simplification and rational numbers. This includes the functions mentioned above as well as methods within the `TrigonometricFunction` class and the `Rational` class.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Start with `fu.py` which contains the main trigonometric simplification functions (`TR2i`, `TR3`, `TR8`, `TR10i`, `TR11`).\n2. Move to `trigonometric.py` to check the implementation of `cos` and `sin`, particularly the methods that could influence simplification with rational arguments.\n3. Examine `numbers.py` for any issues specific to `Rational` numbers not interacting correctly within trigonometric functions.\n4. Lastly, review `trigsimp.py` for additional simplifying strategies or potential missing cases involving rationals.\n\nBased on the identified spans, the relevant code seems connected to the reported issue regarding the inability to simplify trigonometric expressions with Rational numbers.",
