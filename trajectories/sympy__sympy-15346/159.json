            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it seems the user is encountering difficulty in simplifying trigonometric expressions involving Rational numbers. The issue lies specifically with the simplification of sin and cos functions, because the addition formula for cos is not being applied while it works for symbol-based simplification. \n\nFrom the provided file contexts and search results, it is evident that both trigonometric functions (sin and cos) inherit from the class TrigonometricFunction, which includes methods for simplification such as _eval_expand_trig. The sin and cos classes also override this method to handle specific cases more precisely, including when the argument is an Add object. The existing code should be sufficient to address symbol-based simplification matters, however, for Rational numbers, the trigonometric identities often rely on number-theoretic properties and approximation techniques, which are handled differently in the SymPy trigonometric function simplification process, as seen in the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file where the `simplify` function can be found. \n\nThe issue seems rooted in the way SymPy handles simplification of trigonometric functions with numeric instead of symbolic arguments. It appears that the `simplify` function, which attempts to decompose expressions but may not intrinsically handle such special numeric cases strongly until the application of specialized functions like `nsimplify`, might not be covering the gaps encountered when specific identity rules are not being applied for Rational numbers. \n\nReviewing the search results, the directory structure is coherent with the reported issue, especially the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` where the core functionalities of trigonometric functions reside, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` for the general approach to simplify mathematical expressions. Additionally, `sympy/matrices/common.py` revisited here primarily relates method definitions focusing on matrix operations which simplification relevance is ensured through the application of general expr `.simplify()` method passed in the `applyfunc(lambda x: x...)`, hence it's embedded in all codes encountered which possess numeric computation preferences. \n\nTherefore, while all directories and specific function relevance to the reported issue were visited, the key part holding doubt on implementing effectiveness pertains directly to understanding why expressions with Rational arguments (particularly within matrices as demonstrated in the issue examples and likely interact with MatrixOperation structures' way of handling expressions) does not automatically simplify down with standard frameworks, even apparent in cases like `cos(x)*cos(y) - sin(x)*sin(y)` not being resolved automatically to engagement formula `cos(x - y)` outside symbol usage.",
