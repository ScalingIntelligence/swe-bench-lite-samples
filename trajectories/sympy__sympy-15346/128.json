This issue involves functions from the sympy library, specifically sin, cos, and their interactions with Rational numbers. The user demonstrates cases where sin and cos functions with symbolic arguments can be simplified but not when applied to Rational numbers within a Matrix. The search results provide several relevant code spans: 1. TrigonometricFunction and its subclasses (sin, cos, tan, cot) which are directly involved in the issue. 2. The _eval_is_rational and _eval_is_algebraic methods within TrigonometricFunction, relevant for understanding how Rational numbers are handled. 3. The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py, which is likely used to simplify expressions. 4. The simplify method in the MatrixOperations class, which applies the simplification function to elements of a matrix, relevant because the user's issue involves matrices containing trigonometric expressions. These spans are relevant because they directly involve the core logic of trigonometric function evaluation, rational number handling, and expression simplification. Therefore, these code spans should be examined further because they may reveal issues related to the simplification of trigonometric functions with Rational arguments.",

Futhermore, the search results include code spans related to asin, acos, atan, and acot classes, hinting at potential issues with inverse trigonometric functions. Based on the issue description, the relevant code spans seem to be those involving the TrigonometricFunction class methods _eval_is_rational and _eval_is_algebraic. The sin and cos class definitions are also relevant as they are the main focus of the issue. The matrix simplification method in the sympy/matrices/common.py is also relevant since the issue involves matrix operations. Finally, the simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is crucial as it is used to simplify the expressions in question.
