But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about the inability to simplify expressions involving sin/cos with Rational arguments in SymPy, even though general simplification of sin/cos with symbols and Rational numbers works. The provided code examples show that expressions involving sin/cos with symbols or arithmetic expressions of Rational numbers simplify correctly, but when wrapped in a Matrix and used in dot product or matrix operations, they do not simplify. This suggests that the issue might be related to the specific handling of Rational numbers in matrix operations or the simplification of trigonometric functions in these contexts. The analysis of the search results reveals that among the identified code spans, there are functions dealing with simplification of trigonometric expressions (TR2i, TR8, TR10i, TR11, TR12i) and matrix operations (MatrixOperations.simplify, MatrixOperations.xreplace, MatrixExpr.simplify). Given the nature of the issue, it's plausible that the solution might involve improvements in the handling of trigonometric simplifications within matrix operations or adjustments in the simplification logic of trigonometric functions for Rational numbers.",
