This could be due to missing simplification rules or specific handling for trigonometric functions with rational arguments. After analyzing the provided file context, it appears that the code does contain simplification methods for trigonometric functions such as TR2i, TR3, TR8, TR11, and TR12i in the fu.py file. However, the issue specifically mentions that simplification fails when using Rational(1, 50) and Rational(1, 25) as arguments in trigonometric functions. The provided context does not directly address this specific case with rational numbers. Additionally, the functions in fu.py primarily handle trigonometric simplifications with general arguments and do not focus on rational numbers explicitly.

While `sin`, `cos` with symbols can be simplified, and rational numbers can be simplified, the same does not hold when these trigonometric functions are applied to `Rational` numbers in matrices. The user has identified that expressions like `sin(Rational(1, 50)), cos(Rational(1, 50))` do not simplify as expected. This suggests that the simplification logic for trigonometric functions in the `simplify` function or its dependencies may not be handling `Rational` numbers properly. The current context includes files from `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and `sympy/matrices/common.py`. These files contain various simplification rules and functions for trigonometric, exponential, and matrix expressions. The search results include additional spans from `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, which are valuable for understanding the simplification process, especially the handling of trigonometric functions. These spans, especially those involving `TR2i`, `TR3`, `TR8`, `TR10i`, and `TR11` in `sympy/simplify/fu.py, provide key transformations applied to trigonometric expressions. Additionally, the `TrigonometricFunction` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` are central to the simplification process.",
