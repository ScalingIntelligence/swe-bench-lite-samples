The user's example illustrates that regular symbols and Rational numbers outside of trigonometric functions simplify correctly, but when trigonometric functions are applied to Rational numbers, they do not simplify as expected. To address this, we should search within the relevant files specifically for instances where trigonometric functions handle inputs of Rational type and check if there are any conditions preventing simplification. Additionally, reviewing simplification routines in the context of trigonometric functions and matrix operations involving Rational numbers could be beneficial.",

Examined each code span in the search results to find sections related to trigonometric simplification, specifically focusing on sin and cos functions and their simplification logic.\n4. Identified relevant code spans in the files 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py', 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and 'sympy/simplify/fu.py'.\n5. Focused on methods related to trigonometric simplification, such as 'trigsimp_groebner', 'TrigonometricFunction.eval', 'simplify', and 'trig_split'.\n6.
