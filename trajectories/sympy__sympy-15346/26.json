The user's code demonstrates that simplifying sin/cos with symbolic variables works, as does simplifying arithmetic operations with Rational numbers.

This suggests an issue within the simplification logic for trigonometric functions when applied to Rational numbers. The files identified as relevant are 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', and 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py'. Within 'trigonometric.py', the TrigonometricFunction class is defined, which forms the basis of sin, cos, and other trigonometric functions. In 'simplify.py', the simplify function potentially applies various simplification strategies, including trigonometric simplification. 'trigsimp.py' directly addresses simplification of trigonometric expressions.

I need to identify the relevant code spans within the search results that deal with the simplification of trigonometric functions, particularly the handling of Rationals within these functions. Analysing the issue, it seems the focus should be on the methods in the `TrigonometricFunction` class and any related simplification methods.\n\nStep-by-step analysis of search results:\n1. In `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, the `TrigonometricFunction` class and its subclasses (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, etc.) are defined, along with their evaluation methods (`eval`) and expansion methods (`_eval_expand_trig`). These methods handle the basic operations and transformations of trigonometric functions.\n2. In `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, there are functions like `trigsimp_groebner` and `trigsimp` which are crucial for simplification of trigonometric expressions using Groebner bases and other techniques. These are likely places where the Rational simplification logic could be implemented or invoked.\n\nBased on this, the relevant code spans should include those in the `TrigonometricFunction` class and its subclasses, as well as the simplification functions in `trigsimp.py`.",

This discrepancy could arise from the need for specialized handling when dealing with Rational inputs due to their exact nature and potential unique numerical behavior compared to generic symbolic variables.

Notably, the `trigsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` and the `eval` methods for these functions could be significant, as they handle the simplification logic. The `trigsimp` function includes multiple methods for simplification, including 'fu', 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'old', directing to various simplification strategies. The `_eval_expand_trig` methods also provide detailed expansion logic based on polynomial identities using special functions like `chebyshevt`.
