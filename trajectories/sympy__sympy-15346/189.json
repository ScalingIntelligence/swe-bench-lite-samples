The user has observed that symbols can be simplified, but when using Rational numbers within trigonometric functions, simplification does not occur as expected. This suggests that the simplification logic in SymPy might not be handling Rational numbers in the expected manner within trigonometric functions or matrix operations. The relevant files appear to be those related to trigonometric functions, simplification routines, and possibly matrix operations if they involve complex simplifications. We should focus on these areas to find the relevant code for handling and simplifying trigonometric expressions involving Rational numbers.",

The user has observed that certain trigonometric expressions with numerical arguments simplify as expected, but expressions involving Rational numbers do not simplify as the user expects. This discrepancy is observed primarily in matrix operations. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans and determine whether the search task is complete.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the reported issue, which focuses on the simplification of trigonometric functions with Rational arguments, particularly in matrix contexts. The user's example demonstrates that while some expressions simplify, operations involving Rational numbers do not. This suggests potential issues in the evaluation or simplification logic specifically applied to trigonometric functions with Rational arguments or within matrix operations.\n\nNext, I'll examine the existing file context. It includes several relevant spans, such as the TrigonometricFunction class and its methods (_eval_is_rational, _eval_is_algebraic, _eval_expand_complex, etc.), and methods related to sin and cos functions (e.g., _eval_expand_trig, _eval_rewrite_as_sqrt). These spans hint at the core logic dealing with trigonometric functions, their properties, and transformations.\n\nLastly, I'll assess the search results. They provide additional spans that shed more light on the simplification process in the context of trigonometric functions and matrices. Significant new spans include TrigonometricFunction._eval_is_rational, TrigonometricFunction._eval_is_algebraic, and methods for evaluating and transforming sine and cosine functions, which are crucial for understanding how these functions with Rational arguments are handled.\n\nBased on the analysis, I can conclude that the provided search results and file context closely align with the issue reported, offering a comprehensive view of how trigonometric functions, especially with Rational arguments, and matrix operations are managed within the codebase.",
