They expect the simplification of sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25) to result in a simplified form or at least be recognized as part of a known simplifiable expression pattern, such as a trigonometric identity.\n\nThe files related to trigonometric functions are sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py and sympy/matrices/common.py. The relevant methods in the sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py file are `sin.eval`, `sin._eval_expand_trig`, `cos.eval`, and `cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt`. The sympy/matrices/common.py file contains the `MatrixOperations.simplify` method. \n\nThe analysis of these methods reveals the logic of evaluating and simplifying trigonometric expressions, which includes handling of multiple angles, rational coefficients, and different forms of trigonometric functions. The `MatrixOperations.simplify` method suggests the general simplification for matrix operations, which might not directly cover advanced use of trigonometric functions like occurrence inside matrices.\n\nGiven these findings, the critical spans identified are related to the specific handling of sin and cos in both evaluation and simplification contexts, which would help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported issue regarding Rational numbers and trigonometric functions.",
