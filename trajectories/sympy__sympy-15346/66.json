To address this, focus should be placed on understanding how the simplification algorithms in SymPy handle Rational numbers compared to symbolic variables.

The examples provided show that while simple sin and cos expressions with symbols can be simplified, the same cannot be achieved with Rational numbers. The search results contain relevant code spans from various parts of the SymPy codebase, including the fu, trigonometric, matrices, trigsimp, and simplify modules. These modules are key to understanding how trigonometric simplification and matrix operations are handled in SymPy. The code spans include functions and methods that are responsible for simplifying expressions, handling trigonometric functions, and performing matrix operations. By analyzing these spans, we can identify the parts of the codebase that might be relevant to the issue at hand, such as the TR2i, TR8, TR10i, TR11, and TR12i functions in the fu module, the TrigonometricFunction class and its methods in the trigonometric module, and the simplification methods in the matrices module. These code spans can provide insights into how SymPy handles trigonometric simplification and matrix operations, and might reveal why the simplifications with Rational numbers are not working as expected.",

We review the search results and the file context provided to identify functions within `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` that are directly involved with trigonometric simplification and handling of rational numbers. The identified spans involve functions like TR2i, TR8, TR10i in `fu.py` which are part of the trigonometric simplification strategies, and methods like `eval` for `sin` and `cos` in `trigonometric.py` that handle the evaluation of trigonometric functions. Additionally, methods like `_real_to_rational` in `simplify.py` deal with converting real numbers to rational, which is pertinent to the issue at hand. By focusing on these areas, we can effectively identify the necessary code spans for handling the reported issue.",

Additionally, the 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' file contains the core logic for evaluating and simplifying sin and cos functions, including handling Rational arguments. Moreover, the 'sympy/matrices/common.py' module indicates that matrix operations also involve trigonometric simplification, which might be relevant for matrix expressions involving Rational numbers.
