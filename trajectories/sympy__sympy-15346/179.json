The provided file content provides insights into the simplification methods used in SymPy, particularly focusing on Matrix operations and core simplification functions.\n\nIn the context provided, the 'simplify' method in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is the core function for simplification. It handles various aspects including trigonometric simplifications. Additionally, the 'simplify' method in sympy/matrices/common.py applies this core simplification to each element of a matrix.\n\nThe search results include sympy/simplify/fu.py, which contains more detailed simplification techniques specifically for trigonometric functions. Notable functions include TR2i, TR10, TR10i, and TR14 which trace manipulations of trigonometric expressions involving products like sin and cos with possible rational number components in the input arguments. These are particularly relevant as they handle the transformations that might be useful to resolve the given issue where the system fails to simplify trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers. \n\nLastly, sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py is also vital with its 'trigsimp' function that applies various trigonometric simplification strategies, hinting at a deeper layer of trigonometric-specific simplification that might automatically engage with the within the context of rational number usage as part of function arguments.",

Based on the provided context and search results, the relevant spans seem to be those involving trigonometric simplification functions such as TR2i, TR10, TR10i, and TR14.
