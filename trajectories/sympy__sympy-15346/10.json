The key parts of the issue include examples where sin and cos with symbols can be simplified, and Rational numbers can also be simplified. However, when these operations are performed with Rational numbers inside matrices or directly, they fail to simplify as expected. This suggests that the problem might lie in how SymPy evaluates and simplifies trigonometric functions with Rational arguments. The search results provided include several relevant code spans such as 'sin.eval', 'cos.eval', and 'TrigonometricFunction._eval_is_rational'. These spans are likely relevant because they deal with the evaluation and simplification of trigonometric functions in SymPy, which is central to the reported issue.

Specifically, expressions involving sines and cosines of rational numbers are not simplifying as expected. This suggests an issue with the simplification logic within the sympy library.\n\nI have looked at the provided file context and search results to identify relevant code spans that might be causing this issue. The provided search results include sections of code from sympy related to trigonometric functions and simplification. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my analysis:\n\n1. **sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py**: This file contains the definitions for trigonometric functions such as sin and cos, including their evaluation methods (`sin.eval` and `cos.eval`). The `eval` methods handle various cases, including different inputs like Numbers, Add, Mul, etc. This file could be the starting point for understanding how the simplification process is applied.\n\n2. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: This file contains the main `simplify` function, which orchestrates different simplification strategies. The `simplify` function calls various simplification techniques, including those for trigonometric expressions (`trigsimp`).\n\n3. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**: This file contains the `trigsimp` function, which specifically deals with simplifying trigonometric expressions. It includes strategies like `trigsimp_groebner` and `exptrigsimp`.\n\n4. **sympy/simplify/fu.py**: This file contains several functions prefixed with `TR` (like `TR2i`, `TR8`, etc.), which are part of the simplification process for trigonometric expressions. These functions apply various transformation rules to simplify the expressions.\n\nGiven the reported issue, it seems that the simplification process for rational inputs needs to be enhanced. I will identify specific code spans within the above files that handle trigonometric simplifications or transformations for rational numbers.",
