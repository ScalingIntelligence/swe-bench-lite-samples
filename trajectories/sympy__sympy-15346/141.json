It appears that these expressions are not being simplified as expected. Given the referenced files, the focus should be on the trigonometric simplification methods and the handling of Rational numbers in trigonometric functions. The `trigsimp` and `fu` modules in sympy/simplify/ might be particularly relevant, as they contain functions for trigonometric simplification. Additionally, the `Simplify` function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py could be crucial for understanding the overall simplification process and how rationals are handled within it. Also, inspecting the `sin` and `cos` classes in sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py could provide insights into how these functions evaluate and simplify their arguments, including Rational numbers.",

The code provided demonstrates that while other trigonometric simplifications work, those involving rational numbers do not simplify as expected. The initial focus should be on understanding the functionality of the trigonometric simplification functions in SymPy and how they handle such cases.\n\nFirst, reviewing the search results from 'sympy/simplify/fu.py', several transformation functions (TR0, TR2i, TR8, TR9, TR10, TR10i, TR11, TR12i, TRmorrie, TR14, TRpower) are identified that seem relevant to trigonometric simplification. Since these functions are responsible for simplifying various trigonometric expressions, they are good candidates for further inspection based on the user's issue.\n\nNext, from 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', the code spans involving the TrigonometricFunction class and the specific implementations of the sin and cos functions are reviewed. These are fundamental to any trigonometric manipulation and could contain insights into why the simplifications are failing for rational arguments.\n\nFinally, from 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', the simplify function itself is viewed, which likely delegates the work to other functions such as those in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py'. It might not directly solve the issue but informs about the top-level process of simplification.\n\nBased on the analysis, three files ('sympy/simplify/fu.py', 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py') and specific spans within them ('TR0', 'TR2i', 'TR8', 'TR9', 'TR10', 'TR10i', 'TR11', 'TR12i', 'TRmorrie', 'TR14', 'TRpower', 'TrigonometricFunction', 'sin', 'cos', 'simplify') are identified as relevant to the reported issue for understanding and potentially fixing the trigonometric simplification problem related to rational numbers.",
