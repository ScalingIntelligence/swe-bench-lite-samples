The user has provided specific examples where simplifying expressions like sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25)) does not yield the expected simplification. To address this, it's crucial to identify sections of the code that handle trigonometric simplification and rational number processing.\n\nIn the search results, the following key sections are relevant:\n\n1. **sympy/simplify/fu.py** - This file contains multiple functions such as TR8, TR9, TR10, TR10i, TR11, TR14, and TRpower that deal with trigonometric simplification rules. These functions are likely to be involved in the simplification process for trigonometric functions.\n\n2. **sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py** - This file defines the sin and cos classes, which include methods like _eval_expand_trig and _eval_rewrite_as_sqrt that could influence how trigonometric expressions are simplified. These methods are crucial for handling trigonometric functions directly.\n\n3. **sympy/matrices/dense.py** - The MutableDenseMatrix class includes a simplify method that is responsible for simplifying matrix elements. Since the issue involves matrix operations with trigonometric functions, this method could play a part in the simplification process.\n\n4. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py** - The simplify function is defined here, which is the main entry point for simplifying expressions in SymPy. Understanding how it processes input expressions, including those with trigonometric functions and rational numbers, is essential.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can identify the specific code spans that handle the simplification of trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers. This will help pinpoint where the simplification process might be failing or not performing as expected, leading to the issue reported by the user.",
