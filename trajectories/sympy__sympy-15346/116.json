The example shows that simplifying expressions with symbols works correctly, but expressions with Rational numbers do not simplify as expected.

Additionally, the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` and `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` files contain functions related to trigonometric simplification that could be relevant.
