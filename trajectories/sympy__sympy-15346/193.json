Comparing the behavior of trigonometric functions with symbols and Rational numbers, it's evident that simplification works with symbols but fails with Rational numbers in specific contexts such as matrix dot products or direct function calls. This suggests a possible gap or limitation in the simplification logic when handling Rational numbers in trigonometric functions. Focusing the search on the trigonometric simplification functions and the handling of Rational numbers within these functions seems pertinent. Specifically, looking into the 'simplify' function's interaction with trigonometric functions and Rational numbers could be insightful.",

Key areas to focus on in the codebase would be the evaluation and simplification logic of trigonometric functions, particularly for Rational arguments. The search results include several relevant spans from the trigonometric functions module that handle evaluation (`eval`), expansion (`_eval_expand_trig`), and properties like rationality (`_eval_is_rational`). Additionally, the `simplify` function from `sympy.simplify.simplify` is relevant as it is the primary function used for simplification in SymPy. This function attempts to simplify expressions and could be where the logic for Rational number simplification should be implemented or checked for correctness. The `_eval_expand_trig` methods for sin and cos are particularly relevant as they contain the logic for trigonometric expansions, which might include the ability to simplify in specific cases involving rationals. The `_eval_is_rational` methods are important for understanding how rational numbers are handled within these functions and whether they should be simplified further.",
