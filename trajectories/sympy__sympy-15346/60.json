It provides several examples where simplification works for certain cases but fails for others involving rational numbers and trigonometric functions. The key elements identified from the reported issue are the sin and cos functions, rational numbers (Rational), and the need for simplification (simplify method). The search results include relevant files such as 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' and 'sympy/simplify/fu.py', which contain definitions and methods related to trigonometric functions and simplification. The analysis of these files shows that they include classes and methods for the sin and cos functions (sin, cos classes in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py'), as well as simplification strategies (TR0, TR2i, TR8, TR10, TR10i, TR11, TR12i, TRmorrie, TRpower in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py'). These methods are likely candidates for implementation or modification to address the reported issue. The relevant code spans include the definitions of sin and cos functions, their evaluation methods (_eval_expand_trig for sin and cos), and the simplification strategies (TR0, TR2i, TR8, TR10, TR10i, TR11, TR12i, TRmorrie, TRpower). Given the relevance of these spans to the reported issue, it is reasonable to conclude that these are the relevant code spans needed to address the issue.
