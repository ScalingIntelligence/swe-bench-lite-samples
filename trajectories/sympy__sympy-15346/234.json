The `eval` methods for both `sin` and `cos` handle Rational inputs indirectly through the `_pi_coeff` function, which decomposes the argument into a coefficient of pi and manages exact binary fractions, converting them to Rationals when necessary. However, there isn't explicit handling for simplifying trigonometric functions specifically when the input is a Rational number. The `_eval_expand_trig` methods for `sin` and `cos` expand trigonometric expressions but do not focus on Rational numbers; they primarily manage the expansion in terms of integer multiples of the argument. The broader simplification context in SymPy, as exhibited in the `simplify` method of the `MatrixOperations` class, applies simplification to elements of matrices, but it does not specify any special treatment for trigonometric functions with Rational inputs.
