The user provided code snippets and expected outputs, indicating that the simplification works for some cases but fails for others, specifically when dealing with Rational numbers in Matrix operations and dot products. The relevant code spans should focus on the evaluation and simplification of trigonometric functions with Rational number inputs.\n\nFrom the file context, the 'sin' and 'cos' classes in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' are already identified as containing methods ('eval' specifically) that deal with simplification and evaluation of trigonometric functions. This context suggests that the problem might be related to how these functions handle Rational number inputs.\n\nIn the provided search results, I observed that 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' contains additional trigonometric functions and their evaluation methods ('tan', 'cot', 'ReciprocalTrigonometricFunction'). Although these might not directly pertain to the sin/cos simplification issue, understanding their behavior with Rational numbers could provide further insights.\n\nThe 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' is also relevant as it orchestrates the simplification process, including trigonometric simplification. The 'trigsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' and related functions ('exptrigsimp', 'trigsimp_old') might be critical to this issue since they are explicitly designed for trigonometric simplification.\n\nBased on my analysis in the scratch pad, the identified spans focus on the methods in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' that deal with the evaluation of sin and cos functions, specifically how they handle Rational numbers ('sin.eval' and 'cos.eval'). Additionally, code spans in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' related to trigonometric simplification are identified. These sections should provide the necessary context to understand why simplification fails for Rational inputs in some cases.",
