This suggests a problem in how the simplification functions handle Rational inputs within trigonometric contexts. The relevant code is likely to be found in the trigonometric simplification and rational number handling parts of the library. Specifically, examining the 'simplify', 'trigsimp', 'trigonometric', and possibly 'matrices' modules should help identify the problem.",

This problem is anticipated to be resolved within the trigonometric simplification and rational number handling segments of the module. The file context provided depicts an extensive Codebase for fu.py, trigonometric.py, trigsimp.py, and simplify.py. Evaluating this highlighted code, it's apparent the simplification of trigonometric functions i.e cos, sin etc, and handling of Rational numbers are present within these files, specifically in the simplify, TR11 and TR12 methods in fu.py. However, the issue articulates a failure in function when Rational numbers are introduced, suggesting a more intricate interaction. Even though relevant code is think present in trigonometric.py and simplify.py, somehow the functionality seems amiss when Rational numbers are involved. It supports the recommendation to inspect further sine mappings in-depth and possibly other associated files for complete context. Due to the nature of algorithms and dependencies in the codebase, a full confirmation studies before digging into each class, method, and function to grasp the granularity of Sympy's simplification process.",

The user is encountering difficulty in simplifying trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers using the SymPy library. The user has provided examples showing that such expressions are not being simplified as expected. The goal is to identify relevant code spans that might be responsible for this behavior.\n\nReviewing the current file context, the focus is on the 'fu.py' file, which contains several transformation rules for simplifying trigonometric expressions. These rules, such as TR2i, TR8, TR9, TR10i, TR11, and TR12i, are designed to handle various trigonometric simplification tasks. These functions are likely candidates for the issue at hand since they deal specifically with trigonometric simplifications.\n\nProcessing new search results: The focus remains on the 'fu.py' file from the new search results, where the transformations TR8, TR9, TR10i, TR11, and TR12i are highlighted. These functions are further examined for their relevance to the reported issue. TR8 handles simplifying trigonometric expressions in Muls or Pows, while TR9 focuses on simplifying Add expressions. TR10i deals with simplifying Add expressions involving trigonometric functions. TR11 is concerned with simplifying expressions based on multiples of angles, and TR12i handles the simplification of Add, Mul, or Pow expressions involving trigonometric functions.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the functions and their operations, it appears that TR8, TR9, TR10i, TR11, and TR12i are the most relevant code spans to the issue of simplifying trigonometric expressions involving rational numbers.\n\nApplying the Identify function to provide the response with the identified spans.",
