The user provides examples where sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y) simplifies correctly but sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25)) does not. This suggests a problem in the simplification logic specifically for Rational arguments in trigonometric functions. Examining the provided code spans, particularly in the functions/elementary/trigonometric.py and simplify/simplify.py files, reveals methods for evaluating, expanding, and rewriting trigonometric functions. The sin and cos classes have methods for evaluation, expansion, and rewriting, but there is no specific handling for simplification with Rational arguments in the provided spans. The simplify function in simplify/simplify.py uses various simplification strategies but does not focus on trigonometric simplification with Rational arguments directly in the provided spans. Additional inspection of the search results shows similar methods in the sin, cos, and cot classes but none that address the specific issue of simplifying with Rational arguments directly. The trigsimp function in simplify/trigsimp.py uses the fu simplification method which might handle some trigonometric simplifications but the focus on Rational arguments is not clear from the provided spans. Further investigation into the simplification methods and how they handle Rational arguments in trigonometric functions is needed to address the reported issue effectively.",
