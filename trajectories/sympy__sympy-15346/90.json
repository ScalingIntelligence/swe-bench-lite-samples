Specifically, the user is unable to simplify expressions like sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25)). This implies a need to focus on trigonometric simplification methods.\n\n2. The provided file context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet, suggesting this is the initial step in identifying the relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n3. The search results mainly consist of trigonometric functions and their evaluations, which are likely relevant to solving the issue. Key sections include:\n   - TrigonometricFunction class and its subclasses like sin, cos, and their eval and _eval_expand_trig methods.\n   - Functions like TR10 and TR10i in the simplify/fu.py file which deal with simplification of trigonometric expressions.\n\n4. The sin and cos classes, especially their eval methods, handle the evaluation of sine and cosine for different types of arguments, including Rational numbers. The _eval_expand_trig methods are also important as they handle the expansion of trigonometric expressions, which could be relevant for simplifying the given expressions.\n\n5. The TR10 and TR10i functions in simplify/fu.py are dedicated to handling the simplification of trigonometric sums, which directly aligns with the issues faced by the user.\n\n6.

The `_eval_expand_trig` method also includes logic for expanding trigonometric expressions, particularly for sums of angles and multiple angles. Although the file context does not directly address the issue of simplifying trigonometric functions with Rational arguments, the broader context suggests that if the issue involves Rational numbers, it would likely be handled within these methods.
