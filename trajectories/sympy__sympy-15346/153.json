            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves simplifying trigonometric expressions with rational numbers in SymPy, indicating that expressions involving sin/cos with Rational arguments are not being simplified as expected. The primary focus is on understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of trigonometric functions when operating on rational numbers.\n\nThe existing context provided includes evaluations of sin/cos with symbols and rational numbers, demonstrating that sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y) simplifies to cos(x - y), but sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25)) does not simplify further. This discrepancy suggests a need to examine how SymPy handles simplification specifically for trigonometric functions involving rational inputs.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the relevant code spans across several files including 'trigonometric.py', 'fu.py', 'trigsimp.py', and 'simplify.py'. Key areas to focus on include the evaluation and simplification methods of trigonometric functions (like 'sin' and 'cos'), especially those handling rational inputs. Notable code spans involve methods such as '_eval_is_rational', '_eval_is_algebraic', '_eval_rewrite_as_exp', and '_eval_expand_trig', which are critical for understanding and potentially modifying the simplification logic for trigonometric functions.\n\nGiven the search results, the identified spans provide a solid foundation for further analysis and potential modification to address the reported issue.",
