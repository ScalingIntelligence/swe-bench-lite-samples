Specifically, expressions like sin(Rational(1, 50))*sin(Rational(1, 25)) + cos(Rational(1, 50))*cos(Rational(1, 25)) are not simplifying to cos(x-y). I will analyze the provided code spans to identify where the simplification logic for trigonometric functions is defined and how it handles Rational numbers.\n\n1. **TrigonometricFunction class**: This class defines the base class for trigonometric functions and includes methods for evaluating properties like rationality and algebraicity. The _eval_is_rational and _eval_is_algebraic methods are of particular interest as they handle the simplification logic for Rational arguments.\n\n2. **sin and cos classes**: These subclasses of TrigonometricFunction define the actual sine and cosine functions with specialized methods. The _eval_expand_trig method in the sin class and the eval method in the cos class are crucial as they handle expansions and evaluations of trigonometric expressions.\n\n3. **Trigsimp module**: The trigsimp_groebner function and related methods are responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions using Groebner bases, which might be relevant for the simplification of rational arguments.\n\n4. **Fu module**: This module contains various transformation rules (e.g., TR0, TR2i, TR8) designed to simplify trigonometric expressions, potentially including those with Rational arguments.\n\nConsidering the issue, the relevant code spans are likely those that handle the transformation and simplification of trigonometric functions, particularly those that evaluate or expand these functions with Rational arguments. I will identify the spans that directly relate to these processes.",
