The user provides examples where expressions involving symbols and simple rationals can be simplified, but the same is not happening when the expressions involve trig functions of rational numbers. This suggests a potential issue with the simplification logic for trigonometric functions, especially when rational numbers are involved. The search results provide several relevant functions and methods from the SymPy library that handle trigonometric simplification. Notably, 'TR2i', 'TR8', and 'TR11' in 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' are explicit functions designed for transforming trigonometric expressions. 'trigsimp_groebner' in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' also appears relevant, as it uses Groebner bases for simplifying expressions. 'TrigonometricFunction' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' defines the basic behavior of trigonometric functions in SymPy, which could also be pertinent to the issue. Considering these, it's reasonable to hypothesize that the logic within these functions for handling rational inputs might not be robust enough or might miss certain cases where simplification should occur. The provided code spans in the search results offer a starting point for investigating and potentially fixing the issue.",

Given the context and the provided code, I need to identify the relevant parts of the code that deal with simplifying trigonometric expressions, particularly those involving Rational numbers and matrices. I have identified that the `TR2i`, `TR8`, and `TR11` functions in the `fu.py` file are relevant, as they involve simplifying trigonometric expressions. Additionally, the `trigsimp_groebner` function in the `trigsimp.py` file is relevant as it deals with simplifying trigonometric expressions using Groebner bases, which could be a method to handle the complexity introduced by matrices and Rational numbers.

The provided code examples demonstrate this issue with matrices. Looking at the search results, the most relevant code appears to be in the 'MatrixOperations' class within 'sympy/matrices/common.py' and the 'MutableDenseMatrix.simplify' method in 'sympy/matrices/dense.py'. The 'simplify' method in 'MutableDenseMatrix' directly addresses the issue, where simplification of matrix elements is performed by mapping the '_simplify' function over the matrix's elements. This approach ensures that each element of the matrix is simplified. The 'MatrixOperations.simplify' method in 'sympy/matrices/common.py' also performs simplification recursively, which suggests a closer look is needed to ensure that trigonometric simplifications are handled appropriately. Additionally, methods like 'MatrixOperations._eval_trigsimp' in 'sympy/matrices/common.py' may also be relevant for tackling specific trigonometric simplification tasks. This comprehensive evaluation of the search results points towards methods that address the simplification problem in the context of matrices, making them relevant for the reported issue. However, a deeper investigation into how trigonometric specific simplifications are handled within these methods would be necessary to conclude the analysis.",
