This issue involves the simplification of trigonometric functions when the argument is a Rational number, which might not be handled properly in the existing code. The search results contain several files and functions related to trigonometric simplification in SymPy. The files include 'sympy/simplify/fu.py', 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py', and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py'. The relevant functions and spans within these files include TR2i, TR3, TR8, TR9, TR10i, TR11, TR12i, TR13, TRpower from 'fu.py', and various trigonometric functions like cos, tan, and cot from 'trigonometric.py'. Additionally, 'trigsimp_groebner' and 'exptrigsimp' from 'trigsimp.py' are likely relevant for handling trigonometric simplifications involving Rational numbers. The file 'simplify.py' contains utilities possibly used in the simplification process, including '_real_to_rational' which might be used to convert Float to Rational during simplification.
