Particularly TR11 is relevant as it handles transformations for double angle identities, possibly helping in simplifying combinations of sin/cos as seen in the issue description.\n\n2. **sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py** defines the trigonometric functions sin and cos, and contains valuable methods like _eval_is_rational and evaluation methods (eval and _eval_expand_trig) for these functions. Understanding how these functions handle Rational inputs may be crucial.\n\n3. **sympy/core/numbers.py** includes the Rational class with methods specifically designed to process rational numbers, understanding the behavior in relation to trigonometric evaluations is necessary.\n\n4. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py** and **sympy/simplify/simplify.py** are relevant for overall simplification strategies, possibly including specific handling of rational trigonometric inputs.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, especially TR11 in fu.py, the eval methods in trigonometric.py, and the Rational class in numbers.py, I aim to identify key sections of code that may need adjustment or additional handling to resolve the issue of not being able to simplify certain combinations of sin/cos with Rational numbers.",
