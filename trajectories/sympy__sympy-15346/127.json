This method is specifically tailored for dense matrix implementations and uses the same parameters for simplification as in the more general `common.py` file. The simplify file contains the primary simplification logic, including specific handling for trigonometric functions (`TrigonometricFunction`), and various other mathematical expressions and functions. The `simplify` function here is designed to be called on individual expressions, which aligns with how it is used in the matrix-specific files.
