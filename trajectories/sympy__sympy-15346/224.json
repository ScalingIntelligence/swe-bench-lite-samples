The primary focus is on why expressions involving sin and cos with Rational numbers do not simplify as expected. The search results indicate that the relevant code spans are primarily within the trigonometric and simplification modules of SymPy. These modules include TrigonometricFunction, simplify, trigsimp, and fu. The crucial parts of the code involve the handling of trigonometric functions and their simplification logic, particularly where Rational numbers might be involved.\n\n1. Analyzing the TrigonometricFunction class, it is evident that it is the base class for all trigonometric functions, suggesting that any issues related to function behavior would be addressed here.\n2. The simplify function is a general-purpose simplification function, and it includes specific handlers for trigonometric functions. The relevant spans here involve how expressions are processed and simplified, which could be critical for handling situations where Rational numbers are involved.\n3. The trigsimp function is explicitly for simplifying trigonometric expressions. The spans identified here provide insights into the detailed approach used for simplification, including the use of Groebner bases and specific trigonometric identities.\n4. The fu module contains advanced trigonometric simplification functions, especially TR12i, which deals with simplifying complex trigonometric expressions. This could be particularly relevant for the matrix and dot product scenarios described in the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are in the trigonometric function handling and simplification logic, especially focusing on how Rational numbers are processed within these contexts.",
