The 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' file is particularly relevant, as it contains the implementations of the trigonometric functions and their simplification methods.\n\nKey spans of interest include:\n- 'TrigonometricFunction.eval': This method is responsible for evaluating the trigonometric functions and is a likely candidate for issues related to simplification.\n- 'TrigonometricFunction._eval_expand_trig': This method handles the expansion of trigonometric functions, which is another potential area where simplifications might occur.\n- 'cos.eval' and 'sin.eval': Specific implementations for cosine and sine functions, which are central to the user's issue.\n\nThere is also 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', which contains the 'simplify' function that uses strategies for simplifying expressions. This function might also be where the simplification logic for Rational numbers and Symbols differs.\n\nGiven that the issue involves both trigonometric functions and Rational numbers, the logic handling Rational numbers in the evaluation and simplification of trigonometric functions is the primary focus.
