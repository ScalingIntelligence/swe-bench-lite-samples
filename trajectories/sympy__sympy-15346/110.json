The user provides examples where simplification works for symbols and integers but fails for rational numbers within matrix operations. The key components for identifying relevant code spans include the handling of trigonometric functions, rational numbers, and matrix operations like dot products. We should focus on the functions related to trigonometric simplification and rational number handling within the SymPy library, with an emphasis on pieces of code that might directly or indirectly address the integration of these components, including matrix operations.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several utility functions within 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' stand out as potentially relevant: TR2i, TR3, TR8, TR9, TR10i, TR11, TR12i, and trig_split. These functions seem to primarily handle different simplification strategies for trigonometric expressions and might include logic to handle rational numbers as input arguments. Specifically, TR2i seems relevant for handling Mul operations and might deal with rational numbers in the trigonometric context. TR3 and TR11 deal with specific transforms of trigonometric expressions, suggesting they could also interact with simplified forms of expressions involving rational numbers as arguments.\n\nFurthermore, the exptrigsimp function in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' and the nsimplify function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' are notable as they facilitate the simplification of expressions involving trigonometric and exponential functions, operations that could be central to resolving the issue with rational numbers in trigonometric contexts as raised in the user's query.
